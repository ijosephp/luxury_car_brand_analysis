2,"November 27, 1999 3:17PM",bmwboys,"I was talking wiht a friend of mine about this line up of autos. We came to the conclusion that the figures just dont add up. It is not completely fair to put these cars up in head to head competition. The Mercedes and BMW both have sitcker prices arround 95+. The Jaguar and Audi ring up at arround 70K, and Lexus starts arround 55K.
All five are great cars but i personaly believe some are just better than others, not because one is a lesser car, but it is just not in its own league. After doing some research The Lexus is more comperable to a 5-series BMW or a E-class Mercedes. When you look at the competition that way, its pretty clear who is on top. The LS400 offers more toys than either of the 2 Germans and puts it in a totaly different class.
Each of these cars has a totaly different personality. Audis are still a sleeper, the A8 is understated, no one realises it is what it is. Bimmers are known for a sporty reputation. Jaguars are the stuffy british kick, great style and pleanty of problems. Lexus seems to be a total isolation vehicle, a place to get away from any and all noise. Mercedes has always been the ultimate in status, not that is is the best thing out there but its all status.
To say any of these cars is better than another is impossible, they all have some quirk that gives them an edge, i would kill to get into a design center and make my ideal car with all the best things from all the above makers. That would be my super car!"
3,"November 27, 1999 6:29PM",bernard1,"Currently we own a vehicle from Lexus, both of the German makes and Volvo. Each offers a different level of comfort, sport and security. For vault like construction, the Germans have it, and at the top, I believe is the MBZ. Sprotiness, BMW. Quietness goes to the Lexus. Longevity, I believe will go to the MBZ with BMW second. As far as the Lexus, I will have to wait and see.

To all who have complained of the many problems with these autos I have been fortunate. I Have owned 3 MBZ (2 S classes and one SL) and have had no problems with the sales people or the service people. I have had minimal mechanical problems and the cost have been very reasonable. I have only had the Lexus for a year and the only mechanical problem I've had was with the cd changer and Lexus gave me a brand new one. No questions asked. The sales person was a nimrod and they are overly proud of their autos but the Sevice people are execellent. The other Marques could learn a thing or two from these guys. Bye the way, Lexus even sent me a $50 check for bring my car in for a factory recall. The bimmer is only a few months old, but not one problem and the phrase fun to drive just does not describe it.

So far the Lexus has not cost me one dime to maintain (service wise) but with the posted labor prices, I expect that to change and it looks as if the Lexus will be the most expensive to maintain.

Any opinions on this?"
4,"November 27, 1999 9:40PM",merc1,"What ""toys"" does the LS400 offer that are not available on the S-Class or 7-Series, or did you mean the E-Class and 5-Series? If its the 5 and E, the LS is a notch above those 2 in most areas.
The S-Class does not have a sticker of 95K, and the only 7-Series approaching that price is the 750iL, unless you get one of the protection models. The competitive models, S430 and 740iL are not 95K cars.

5,"November 27, 1999 10:29PM",enigma23,But the S500 is knocking on $90K+!!
6,"November 28, 1999 8:33AM",bmwboys,"After adding tax and lux tax and destianation charges you are at 95. I was reffering to a 750, primarialy cuz it is the king ok the BMW line up, as is the LS to Lexus.
as for the toys, im not sure what all Lexus puts in their cars but i do own a BMW 7 with so many gadgets that it is almost crazy.
To me the toys of my car are: Heated Steering Wheel, Comfort seats with an adjustable sholder rest, 8 Air Bags, Insulated Windows, power rear seats with heat, radar in the bumpers, power sun shades.
Its all the little toys i love and BMW is known for their toys.
What all does Lexus offer? I know that Jaguar is a pretty boring car on the inside, very plush, but boring."
7,"November 28, 1999 5:53PM",enigma23,How are 8 airbags toys?? I would consider them as Safety features and would never think of them as toys.
8,"November 28, 1999 11:34PM",jbradb,"I've seen edmunds re used LS400s, but any strong feelings? seems '96 ('95?) was a style change and '98 was an engine change. other than those two biggies, what do you Lexophiles think?

I'm not asking opinions about WHETHER to get a Lexus vs. other brand. I've driven enough to know they are like apples and oranges. Thanks!"
9,"November 28, 1999 11:47PM",enigma23,"jbradb,

The 1st generation LS400 went from 1990 thru the 1994 model year. The 2nd generation LS400 came out during the 1995 model year. The 2 1/2 generation LS400 came out for the 1998 model year.

Basically the 1998-2000 LS400 is the same car as the 1995(2nd generation LS400). The basic changes that Lexus made for the 1998 model year were a new engine and transmission, different gauge cluster, more wood trim, different front fenders, bumper, lights, grille, and hood, as well as different wheels. Other changes were a Drive-by-wire Throttle control system, standard VSC, and numerous other features were added. ALso the rear tailights were slightly redesigned.

1995 was a complete overhaul of the car from the 1994(1st generation) LS400.

Is that what you wanted to know? Or was it somethign else?"
10,"November 29, 1999 12:00AM",jbradb,"enigma23,

Exactly what I was wanting to know. So, between '95/'96/'97, not alot of difference? (I don't think I'd look earlier than a '95 anyway)

Price for these seems to run ~5K more for each later year u get. So, I could get a '95 for mid-upper 20Ks...but a '98 would run 40-45K, other things being equal. I guess u see my point. It might just come down to my looking at them on a lot and comparing one after another. Thanks!"
11,"November 29, 1999 5:04AM",merc1,"You add taxes and destination to any car and the price goes up dramatically. The MSRP is not 90K for a S500. Car & Driver adds luxury tax to a car's MSRP too and then says that this is the ""base"" price. The 750iL is a good 90K car no matter how you slice it, but the S500 isn't.

12,"November 29, 1999 5:47AM",enigma23,"jbradb,

Yes the 1995 to 1997 models were basically identical. The only thing that changed was for 1997, when Lexus added Side-impact airbags."
13,"November 30, 1999 5:55AM",jbradb,"edmund's give ""fair mkt. value"" at 34K, whereas Kelly BB says ""retail"" is 38K....who's closer? dealer seems to be 1K above Kelly BB before negotiation."
14,"November 30, 1999 4:55PM",enigma23,"Kelly's BB is closer to actual retail value. I always found that Edmunds numbers are usually off by alot. The reason edmunds is not as good is because they only give one standardized price for the entire country. Whereas, KBBs values change based on where you live."
15,"November 30, 1999 5:53PM",rollie,"Regarding post #15:

In my experience, Kelly's prices are typically closer to what you would PAY for a used car if you bought it off a lot. Edmunds and NADA (which offers wholesale and retail prices) seem to be closer to what you would get if you sell it yourself or buy from the owner which is typically less than the Kelly price.

Jag boring??? Being the experienced Jaguar owner that I am, ;-) 25 days and counting, the car I drive, is anything but dull. The tires are rated to 168 mph!!! The sound system tricks you into thinking you are in a concert hall - all alone, with the artist performing just for you. I can't tell you how many friends, relatives and clients have said 'I have never ridden in a Jaguar before.' This 2000 XJ8 L is treating me sweetly. Surely, there are other 4 wheel carts with more gizmos. But ya know, I have been kept busy reading the four books that came with this vehicle, as it is. It does the important stuff, with out the clutter of features, that perhaps only bring bragging right. As one of our Edmunds comrades has said, 'The Jag, has old world charm.' Enjoying her Jag, Jody"
17,"December 6, 1999 4:06PM",simeonm,"Upon my first visit to this site, I read with great interest, the discussion about the various luxury sedans. From my perspective the $$ has little to do with the ""ranking"" of the car. There is really very little difference in the cost. The issue to me is how does the vehicle compare? In my humnble opinion there are two choices....everything else and the BMW. The LS400 is a vewry fine vehicle yet it is boring. The MB....is what I'll drive when I am a grandfather. Until then, I want to hear and feel the power of my bimmer as I roll by.

18,"December 13, 1999 5:06PM",bmwboys,"Hey Jody,
I would have to admit your right on the jaguar being boring. It is one of the SEXIEST cars on the road, and there is nothing that turns heads more than a jag, but my bigest problem was that it was really slopy on the road. I traded my BMW M3 for a jaguar XJR and i wish i could get my M3 back. The jag was sexy and it was fast but i didnt feel like i was in control any longer. As for the interior appointments, what the jag lacks in gizmos it makes up for in wood. I think that is one of the best parts of a jag is all the wood. It is simple and that does make it classic, but i found the speedometer hard to read. do you have that problem?
By the way i sold my XJR 4 months after i owned it. 2100 miles. Someone got a deal, so if you see a white XJR wiht tinted windows it could be mine!"
19,"December 13, 1999 5:07PM",bmwboys,"Hey Simon,
Im a BMW nut as well, what do you drive?
Jon"
20,"December 15, 1999 5:07AM",jodys2,"Hey thanks Jon,

You are a gentleman! Thanks for acknowledging some of the Jag's good points. It must have been VERY disappointing to regret the Jag purchase, after just a couple thousand miles. Already, I have 1,500 on mine and feel like a newly licensed driver, anxious to run errands, so that I have an excuse to go for a drive. I do admit to being a naive luxury car owner. 'Curb' appeal is super important to me. Some of the high-end models I looked at on dealer showrooms were so nondescript, that I didn't even want to take them for a test drive. So many of the vehicles today, look like every other car on the road. A big part of the fun of driving a dream car, is having a great looking car. The rides I had in the 'other' luxury models, didn't seem to compare to this Jag, for what I was looking for, which was a luxury sedan. My humble experience has been, that the comfort of this XJ8 L's cornering, and acceleration, cause me to want to drive like a NASCAR driver. Guess I understand the higher insurance now

21,"December 15, 1999 4:35PM",satisfied2,"Over the past 25 years I have had some real nice cars. Several BMW's,several MB's, several Volvo's a Lexus an Infiniti q45 and a couple of Porsche's. My newest is an Audi A8 which is both sporty and luxurious at the same time. Absolutely the best car I have had. A fun car that instills an abundance of confidence. It doesn't turn as many heads as did some of my past vehicles but I sure do have fun driving it."
22,"December 15, 1999 11:29PM",bmwboys,"Hey Jody
I am in total agreement with the errands. I was driving to the other side of town to rent a movie and the same with getting new CDs I got in some big trouble with my partner about all the errands i ran in the first 2 weeks of owning my Z3 Coupe. I put 2200 miles on in 2 weeks, i was told to put my new toy away and not to drive it till the next month. I was crushed. The funny thing is that i was ""depressed"" about driving my normal every day car which is a 750iL. And then it hit me how silly i was.
I bet the L in your Jag helps a lot, our XJR was the short wheel base and i felt like it was cramped. plus i am 6'1"". How tall are you that you fit so perfectly?
I am about to get my newest toy from BMW, an X5. You know their new sport utility. Now i have to try to keep in mind not to drive so much and so far the fist few weeks.
By the way what color is your jag?"
23,"December 16, 1999 3:45AM",jodys2,"Believe it or not Jon, green IS my favorite color. I had no choice but to get this dark green, it is perfect for my first luxury car, stately, but still with some pizazz. You are right about the extra room in the long wheel base. The back seat legroom is huge! The deciding factor in getting the L model was the additional headroom the driver feels. While the stats don't show it, the salesfolks said and I noticed the difference. I am 5'8"", and the headliner is now comfortable.

I bet you can hardly wait for your new toy to arrive! Sport utilities are hugely popular here in the Minnesota. Enjoy it! Those first few thousand miles have to be the best, everything is so new and appreciated. Actually, I have used the 'car and toy in one' rationalization a lot. We don't have to wait for the weekend or vacations for a bit of fun. Plus the car and toy only take up one stall in the garage. What color are you looking forward to?

Jody

P.S. Today's Jag Joy: Teenage boy working at the hamburger drive thru exclaims, ""Is that a Jaguar?"" ""Wow, that is a great looking car."" FYI-in high school, I also worked at that hamburger joint and rode my Schwin bike to work..."
24,"December 16, 1999 4:45AM",bmwboys,"British RACING Green, the key word racing!
It is amazing how many people have never, or rarely see a jag. When i took mine in for service, 3 days after taking delivery..... we can get into that later, i got an XK8 conv. and the guys at some burger place were just crazy about it, ""what kind of car is that"", and this one woman got out of the car in front of me and wanted to take a look. There is just something special about a jag.
But i must be true to my passion and drive my Bimmers. I even named my dog Bmer.
My new toy, christmas present actually, i have been a VERY good boy this year, is going to be in eihter green or silver. The green hides all the lines of the car but i already have a silver car, but silver hides dirt and is easy to wash.
its a toss up. Ill just let Santa decide!
You know what i miss most about my jag, the wheels, i had the big 18"" wheels, they were so sexy, that and the wood steering wheel.
Well jody i got to get to bed
Ill talk to you later!"

Does he get to ride in your BMW? My pouch, Pete, hasn't quite made it to his first Jag ride yet. I don't know how much longer I can hold out.

Silver is a great color. You are so right about its ability to hide the dirt. Just the same, I've got to hope Old Saint Nick chooses green for you. When do you hope to take delivery? Xmas Eve?

Jon, when you get a chance, share your horror stories about the Jag, including what model year you had. I took the vehicle in for a non-lighting heated seat button. I left the dealership REALLY disappointed, because after a full day they could not fix it. Guess they sell vehicles without having the electrical layout references on hand. FYI - that was three weeks ago and still no fix in site."
26,"December 18, 1999 4:38PM",bmwboys,"hey jody,
My baby Bmer rode in a BMW after 3 weeks and now he turns his nose up at the sight of a toyota....
He tries to drive everychance he gets, most times he has his rear paws on my chest and the 2 front on the wheel, its just so he can see out the window but it looks really strange.
Well about my jag trouble......
i had a 98 XJR upon delivery the fog lights didnt work, a few lights on the dash didnt work, and the car had a wobble in it when driving. The gear shift looked like it had been put on wiht some serious force, i mean really torn up. The trunk didnt close properly and the paint was not very good. I was really disapointed.
The service department was a joke, i took the stuff into get fixed and the service mangager LIED to me. The problems took forever to fix and when i got the car back 2 of my rims were badly damaged.

I was not happy and after that i was just burt wiht Jaguar.

About my new toy, santa cant get it into his bag of goodies. It will be here in feb, it can be a romantic present.
Im hopeing for green but i may get out voted on silver.

ill talk wiht you later i have a plumber walking in the door.

27,"December 19, 1999 8:34PM",ste345,Tire problems cannot get the vibration out.
28,"December 22, 1999 1:46AM",jodys2,"Isn't it amazing the lack of professionalism found in so many places today? Jon, I totally understand your disappointment with the condition and subsequent repair attempts. True story: when I went to pick up my 2000 Jag, the interior leather and headliner were smeared with dark 'stuff' in at least five places. I am NOT a white glove type of person, but wouldn't you think SOMEONE at the dealership would have noticed the interior condition of the vehicle, before a customer came in to pick up an auto and that required writing a check for nearly $65k?

Is great service a dealer, by dealer commodity? Or are there any models that have a corner on the market? Bets are that the BMW dealerships have treated bmwboys well. Say, what type of dog is little Bmmer?"
29,"December 23, 1999 9:26PM",bmwboys,"Hey Jody,
I truly believe that service is just something that a dealer has or doesnt. That was the main reason i was so unhappy with my jag was the service. It wasnt untill after i had been there that i realised that my BMW dealer was SO much better.
But once my favoriate service manager left things went down hill fast. The replacement of a new sales manager is quickly pushing me over the top. Maybe ill just go someplace else. In the last 3 years i have purchased 8 new BMWs and refered several frineds there. The ""royal"" treatment is wearing off fast.

That business with your headliner is not acceptable. I believe that when they make a mess they fix it. I had some lettering disapear off a door on the inside of my car, and it was there when i dropped the car off, well you better believe they replaced the whole panel. I expect my new car to be perfect, even if i have to bring it back several times. And since they had already had my car for a few days i gave back the 3 series loaner and demanded their 750il demo car. I got it.
it is all in how you approach the situation.
Good luck wiht your service dept.

The Lexus is still planned to have it. What with the elimination of the Euro delivery discount (or any reasonable negotiation below the inflated MSRP) and the quality and other issues reported, MB seems to be helping me make a seemingly difficult decision.

I agree with all your points on the A8 except the price. If anybody pays $70k for an A8 they should have a hole installed in their head where a brain can be inserted. The A8s have been moving at huge discounts for most of their time on the market. I read of several people buying them for the low to mid 50s.

78,"February 6, 2000 9:13PM",scongro,"First of all, going back to something a few responses back, some were saying that Lexus copied MB's ""430"" badging. Does anyone remember the '93 MB ""190 E"". In 1994 MB revamped their entire badging system, using the number to represent displacement, while Lexus used this system from the start. I'm sure MB didn't do this because they were bored.(a side note-Acura also did this, but they need a V8 to really compete)

Second, I know that the '00 LS 400 has a higher bhp than BMW & MB (282-BMW 740i/740il, 275-MB S430, 290- LS 400). The '01 LS 430 will probably have a horsepower boost to lift it over the S500(302bhp). Mix that with the stetched wheelbase of 3""-4""(best guess when I compared the '00 & '01), the additional options coming next year, and the fact that Lexus probably will not raise the price more than $5000, I think that Lexus will probably win the V8 segment of this market, with MB winning the V12 for '01, as I heard they are coming out with a new V12 engine. Don't get me wrong, BMW will still have their following, catering to the people who like the ""thrill of driving"""
79,"February 6, 2000 11:18PM",enigmaone,"Mercedes has always, sorta, named their cars based on engine displacement. The 190E was the sole Mercedes model whose model name did not follow engine displacement. Otherwise, the 300E, 420SEL, 300SEL, followed, strictly, engine displacement size. Of course then Mercedes had cars like the 560SEL and 560SEC which did not have 5.6L V8s but had 5.5L V8s.

And looking back to when the last generation S-class came out in 1991, you can see that Mercedes renamed the SEL with a 4.2L V8 from 420SEL in 1990 to 400SEL in 1991, even though the 1991 retained a 4.2L V8. Not to mention when the E-class finally got a V8 motor, it was named 400E instead of 420E. Maybe Mercedes renamed their 4.2L powered cars too 400E because Lexus had the ""400""! And later, of course, Mercedes dropped the SEL, E, SEC, SL, from the end of the model names and changed the designations from 400E, 420SEL, to E400, S420. Again, maybe because of Lexus they did it!

82,"February 7, 2000 11:30PM",flint350,"My Lexus dealer called me this weekend to solicit a $1000 deposit to secure my place in line to buy a new LS430 from him. While we were talking, he re-iterated that the Lexus reps are telling him that the engine will be over 300hp and not the advertised 290. Not that it's all that important as long as the performance is there, just a point of interest.
Enigma - when I go down to talk with the dealer about the deposit, I would want more than just a place in line. That implies whatever comes in (color, equip) is what you may have to settle for. I am not inclined to do that. I want a fully loaded car with a reasonable color choice. If I am going to spend the big bucks and live with it for quite a while, I want choice. So, is the deposit a waste of time? Or, if I just wait to order what I want, what are the chances of getting shut out for a LONG time. I can order the MB S430 from the factory exactly as I want it and get it in 3 mos. Will Lexus be about the same or a little longer, or is the early demand probably going to eat up all early allotments? Interested in your opinion on this. Thanks"
83,"February 8, 2000 1:27AM",enigmaone,"flint,

Usually the dealer will ask you for color choice and equipment choice when that data becomes available to the dealer itself. Currently, no Lexus dealer knows the exact 10 colors that will be offered or the exact standard and options that will be available. And the most important thing, they don't know the price yet, of the standard car or prices for options.

This is what our dealer did with cars before they came out- I'll take for example the RX300 before it came out-
1) Even before Color choice, equipment choice is known, the dealer takes deposits from customers so that they can get one of the earlier RX300s. Of course, with a popular product, the later you put a deposit, the later you get the car.
2) When color choices, combinations, standard features and options are known(usually about a month before the cars hit showrooms), dealer ask each individual customer what options they want, what they don't want, what they can live without, what options they can't live without, and their top 2 to 3 color choices that they would like.
3) Dealer puts in order preferences for each customer every few weeks. Order preferences are basically where the dealer sits down at the computer and punches in what the dealership needs in colors, equipment and options to fill customer orders. And what Lexus NA does is try to get each dealer the proper cars they need(with proper colors, equipment, etc.) to sell to customers or to fill pre-existing orders.

And typically the cars do basically appear in the order that you were on the waiting list. Usually the only times that things go wrong:

1) is if the color you wanted, nobody else wants, and therefore they don't produce many of them.

2) the equipment levels you want is something that Lexus does not build alot of. Example: You want a car with Leather but no moonroof. If someone wanted a car like that, they are going to be waiting a long time for delivery!

3) Production problems have cut production. Of course, it rarely happens these days!

4) the dealer you put a deposit/order with is run by a bunch of morons. And they don't bother placing order preferences, etc. with Lexus or they never bothered to ask customer for color, equipment preferences.

5) And of course, if could be any combination of the above 4 reasons.

The Deposit is not a waste of time. As it ""should"" guarantee that you get the car sooner rather than later. For example, if you put a deposit and you are #10 on the list of customers who are waiting for 2001 LS430s, you should be about the 10th one to get the car. I have seen some customers get cars earlier rather than later. And i have also seen the opposite happen. Again, what happens depends mainly on color availability and equipment availability.

Even if you order a LS430 once colors, equipment, options, and prices are set in or around August. You should be able to get a LS430 built the way you want it, in about 3 months. Usually even with high demand, 3 months is the longest it would take for your car to arrive from Japan from the time you ordered it.

I would go through and pick your dealers and salespersons brain apart with reference to ordering and what the deposit means as far as your place in line."

Acura dropped the ""Legend"" name becase the Acura name wasn't recognized and the Legend name was recognized by everyone. Typically when you would ask a Acura Legend owner what car they owned, they would tell you Legend. When you ask a mecedes E430 or a BMW 740i, or a Lexus LS400 owner you get the answer, typically, of Mercedes, BMW, or Lexus. In the end because of the name association problem, the Legend was never truly considered a luxury car buy buyers and the general public.

I used to think there was a lot of resemblance in the rear between these two cars until I saw them parked side by side about a year ago. The only similarity I see is in the fact that the rear end tapers in as you look from the top down. Oddly my memory of the Accord included the flared sides like the S80 but it really isn't there (there is a bow to the sides but if you open the doors and look at the shape it isn't even close).

The Accord, nor any other car, has sculpted rear lights like the S80 either (and once you consider size these cars really start to diverge). If you see the S80 in a light color where the molding stands out you won't even think about the Accord (I prefer the dark color to hide the molding).

For those who seriously do think there is a lot of resemblance, the S80 is based off of the ECC concept car Volvo showed many years ago (1991 or 1992?) and predates the Accord I believe. If there is any copying it is Honda copying the ECC but again, as much as some Japanese car companies copy, I think the actual resemblances are slight and accidental on the part of Honda. In fact, with further digging, I wouldn't be surprised to find that there are other cars with similar rear designs from a few years back (I would guess small European cars that never make it here).

""Culture""?
Let me finish my input to this forum with 2 gold-on-silver designs, please bear with just 2 more pictures that have nothing to do with luxury cars but they have everything to do with people who drive Mercedes and Lexus:

Both are watches that tell time as you can see.
On your left is a Rolex with original gold-on-silver design and looks, MSRP $4275 US.
On your right is a Seiko with that stolen gold-on-silver looks, MSRP $195 US.
The truth:
Rolex=Mercedes
Seiko=Lexus
It's the ""culture"" thing that's going on overthere.
...
Someone wrote earlier about our earth, moon, and sun. I want to add to his/her remarks:
""If you live on the moon then you see the earth orbiting the moon"".
Analogously,
""Lexus' owners would disagree that Lexus steals Mercedes' styling"".
Personally, I would not buy a Seiko when knowing that Seiko stole the looks of Rolex, nor I would step into a Lexus knowing that Lexus imitated Mercedes' looks because I would not feel good driving a Lexus.
I would feel like driving a stolen design.

Is this Evil Lexus copying M-B? No, wait it's Evil Cadillac copying Lexus, or are they also stealing from M-B? OR maybe it's just car makers adopting the latest trend in auto styling!

Also - there are a lot of European watch makers that use the same gold-on-silver design. Who ""stole"" it first? Further - the people that will buy the Rolex at $4275 and the people that buy the Seiko at $195 are not the same crowd.

118,"February 24, 2000 9:13AM",jaw7,"I cant afford the top of the line Mercedes/Lexus but let me tell you what qualities a Mercedes has that other cars dont. They are subjective but hard to dispute. Lexus goal is to build the most refined car in every luxury car class. MB' goal is (or use to be)to build the best large, medium and small car in the world.
They age the best. A well maintained two year old Mercedes feels like a new Mercedes that feels like a well maintained Mercedes with 200,000 miles on it. There structures are the best in the world and have always been but its not just the over-built unibody. Its the seat frames and transmisions and door handles and door movement and heft of controls. It breaks you fix it and you have a new car again. Lexus dont do that. BMW's dont do that. The automotive world will copy Mercedes so that there cars will have that shift gate or door handles or whatever Mercedes have worth copying. The copiers are getting closer and closer.

Mercedes maintain thier desirablility. Old 4 door Mercedes with few exceptions are classy. Old 2 doors are more likely to classics than unpresentable as time goes on. They have the best mass production car stylist in the world. That's why they are slavishly imitated. By America and Japan. If you read up on the machine Mercedes has in place to get it stylist and engineers you'll know why they are trend setters.

For the short run they always shake out at or near the top of the total cost heap for luxury cars (check consumer guide/report).

Lexus are great cars. I think that they are priced appropriately in the US. You get a pseudo Mercedes for 10-15% less than the price of a real one. They actually do most of things as well or better than a Mercedes. It is not a stretch to call a Lexus a pseudo Benz. They copy Mercedes within an inch of copyright infringement with every succeeding model. I actually thought the new LS430 was originally looking until I saw them side by side in this discussion group.

Mercedes are modern classics. I have had two BMW's. I could see buying a 3 series but the 5's and 7's are garbage. My 98 BMW 528i always had mechanical problems and felt relatively cheap after a few months.

If you really like cars or going to keep your car for a while get a Benz.

If you are not really a car person chances are you are not going to appreciate Mercedes qualities enough to pay extra for them unless you're going to keep your car for a while.

BMW's are fun to drive but you pay for that fun with poor reliability and all around poor quality."

The MB SL500s interior, though, is not expensively detailed. Except for the leather being higher grade, the interior looks basically like a scaled down version of the old S-class interior.

One of the main complaints (from non-owners I might add) about the previous S was that it just looked too big. I personally loved the way that car traveled down the road, you knew what it was and you knew it was a giga-buck car. The new car was styled to fit in visually and not portray it's mass so much, kind of like the Audi A8, which also a big car, but upon first glance it doesn't look it. Hello25 you're also on point about the SL being missed. The current SL has been may absolute favorite car for 10 years now. I can't bare the thought of it being replaced.

I remember also, one or two magazines pointed out that even though on paper the Aurora might be as solid, in person the car did not drive as solid as a E-class nor did the Aurora feel like it was carved out of one piece of metal like the E-class felt.

Can anyone comment on what price they paid for a BMW7?

My local dealer in Denver is offering a no haggle price of $2k off the 7s.

I checked carorder.com and their price is about $3.5k off for the options I want on a 740iA that include the sport package, rear sun shade, and rear side airbag. MSRP is $68560. Carorder has it for $64890. Local dealer has same car less the rear shade and rear side airbag for $65930 with MSRP of $67970.

I checked the BMWUSA site and read about the special prices they had for european delivery. For the 740i, the price is about $4300 off MSRP. At this price, it would be the best price I've seen, better than even carorder.com! Has anyone done this? Is it worth the trip if you hadn't plan to travel to Germany otherwise? What are the final charges for shipping and handling?

Final question: what is the best color for a 740i with the sport package? I know color is a personal choice but I would like to know why you like the color that you choose. I was thinking of choosing a bright firey red. ""Imola Red"" would be my first choice. This color is only available on the 740i with sport package. I was concern however that the red color will emphasize too much on sport and not enough on the luxury side of the 740i.

148,"March 29, 2000 9:40PM",justiceisdead,"Out of respect for the topic of this forum and for its contributors, this will be my last post here.

I understand and respect the fact that we both have differing opinions, Merc. I don't expect to ""convert"" you, just as you will never ""convert"" me. *Smirks* I'm sure we each have rational reasons for thinking the way we do.

I sincerely think that Rolls-Royce and Bentley top Mercedes-Benz by a substantial margin. The difference is in the craftsmanship, the quality of the materials, and the build quality. Rolls-Royces and Bentleys are quite literally designer items. You don't go to a dealership and just buy one like you do in the case of a Mercedes-Benz; you commission them.

The ""technological"" argument is rather moot, IMHO. Arguing that Crewe cars are ""decades behind"" in technological sophistication is like arguing about the obsolescence of the front-engine, rear wheel drive layout or the internal combustion engine (two things which every Mercedes-Benz has). Just because something may be ""outdated"" in accordance with modern standards does not necessarily mean it's inferior. Quite the contrary, the ""obsolete technology"" in Crewe cars is time-proven and just as good if not better than the ""superior technology"" in a Mercedes-Benz.

You also seem to forget that the recent investments by Bayerische Motoren Werke and Volkswagen have contributed greatly to the ""modernization"" of Rolls-Royce and Bentley motorcars. I'm sorry, Merc, but I'm afraid we'll have to differ on this. In my honest opinion, I think the Mercedes-Benz ""superior technology"" you speak of consists of nothing more than gimmicks and ""toys"" (like the chromed wands which extend from the rear of the car) to make an affluent buyer feel ""special."" They are trivial ""extras"" which experienced drivers will never need or have a use for in their lifetime. Rolls-Royces and Bentleys have individuality, and endear to their owners in ways German cars couldn't match on their best day.

Also, making a car more ""idiot proof"" only increases the risks of expensive repairs when that ""superior technology"" fails, and in a way fosters irresponsible driving. Simply put, if we absolutely need technical innovations like Parktronic and that cruise control that slows the car down when you approach another car too quickly, we really shouldn't be on the road.

So if I had $300,000 lying around, I'd go with a more individual Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible over a bland and ho-hum (in my opinion) SL600, or a Park Ward over an S600. To me, Mercedes-Benzes, BMWs, and Lexii are as common as apples and, as the Edmund's staff puts it, clutter the highways like salmon travelling upstream to spawn.

Anyhow, I think I've said enough. Once again, this will be my last post, and let's not allow our differences in opinion make us mortal enemies. ;o)"
149,"March 30, 2000 9:35AM",merc1,"You must have misunderstood my last post. I agree with you totally about Bentley/Rolls craftsmanship and status. They are the top status symbol in luxury cars, if not cars period. However like I said before, I can't see why a 300K should be ""forgiven"" for not having the same features as a Jetta or Corolla. Furthermore most people don't have 300K ""lying around"" anyway, nor do I. I do have about 40-45K to spend on my next car though, so a ""ho-hum"" Mercedes or BMW will have to do. I deal in reality, not what if's. That said, you're correct, a Bentley is a stunning car. There is not other car more lavishly built than a Rolls or Bentley.

You also said that some of Mercedes' technical innovations are just ""gimmicks"". Hmmm, an electronic stability program for a rear-drive hi-performance car is indeed a revelation in bad conditions, something that I don't recall any Rolls and Bentley models having. Side airbags and Xenon lights gimmicks, yeah right. Xenon lights have changed many peoples perspective of night driving, because they are now comfortable doing so because of the level of vision these type of lights provide. Parktronic, something that Bentley does have, so if it's a so-called ""gimmick"" then Bentley is guilty too. Any big car owner will tell you that any parking assistance system is helpful, but not a must-have. That is the point of a luxury car...convenience. About VW and BMW sharing Rolls and Bentley. If those British brands were so good, they would not have needed a savior from.....Germany. Their cars would be 25 years behind without their help. My point is that while Bentley and Rolls are fabulous cars, they aren't the all around best. The best in my opinion are from Germany, ho hum and all.
However, I were filthy rich I would have several Bentleys too. I like them both, but Mercedes is just my #1. Lastly, don't group Mercedes and BMW with even more pedestrian brands like Lexus.

Merc,

I don't knock things like ESC or Xenon headlamps, but the reason I call them gimmicks is because most everyone does fine without them. My car has a cheap (compared to the systems on the cars we've been talking about) traction control system that uses the rear drum brakes and throttle to control wheel spin on a slippery surface. It may be crude compared to the systems found on Benzes, but it gets the job done nevertheless.

Skid control? It's a great feature I suggested should be put on the next generation Fleetwood Brougham, but all I need to do is just drive slower in bad weather to accommodate for sharp turns and the like. With a little investment, I could easily have a Xenon HID headlamp system installed on my vehicle. Will I need it? Probably not... I don't usually drive during the night at high speeds thinking I'm Bob Bondurant.

Like I said, not everybody needs (or wants) these perks. Granted, they are beneficial, but who really thinks about them?

Assuming that post was directed towards me (and I apologize if that assumption is wrong), all I have to say is this:

""the transmission was made by GM""

Don't get me started on GM transmissions... I curse the 4L60-E in my Cadillac.

""the radio was made by GM Delco""

After reprogramming the equalizer settings (something most people don't know how or CARE to do), that AC Delco stereo makes this country bumpkin think he's in Carnegie Hall whenever he pops in a cassette of Claude Debussy or Johnny Mathis.

""the car had oversteer like an American car from 1965""

For your information, I happen to like that ""pinky finger"" steering. I'm so used to it by now that I have no complaints about it. It's strictly a matter of PREFERENCE, and there is no such thing as a ""superior"" amount of steering effort, whether it's highly assisted or taut.

""the windows went down and refused to go back up""

I never had that problem happen to me.

I thought that a trip computer which told me the gas mileage and estimated distance to empty, high beams that automatically dimmed whenever a car passed in the opposite lane, automatic headlamps, an electrochromatic rearview mirror, dual air bags, a rear air suspension that kept the tail from dragging and the car from pitching and rolling all over the place, and ABS were all the technology one could ask for.

The latest tech features aren't what bring me and my checkbook into a showroom. I buy cars for their ride, not their technology or handling ""qualities"" (though I certainly appreciate a little technological extra here and there).

All electronics work perfectly, no handling problems, two long trips with speeds up to 100 mph (just ot test it out). Lots of around town driving, Absolutely perfect.

I chose the Jag over the MB 430 and BMW 740 and am glad I did. It is a wonderful, comfortable car to own and drive. Very understated elegance with great performance.

Previous car was a BMW 7 series which had a lot of early life failures. This Jag is perfect. Not one problem."

The only mechanical problems I have had are minor: the button light for the passenger front heated seat did not light up when on (but the seat did heat) and the car pulled to the right a bit. The dealership service department said the XJ8's tend to need to be watched for front end alignments. Both issues have been addressed.

I sure am happy with my purchase. The vehicle gets a lot of well deserved attention.

I'd like to see that too,also with the LS 430. By the way, I looked on MB's Germany web site, and they have the new S600 for sale over there, but is was not a 6.0 V12, but a 5.8 V12. Do you know if they will import it as 6 or a 5.8?"
167,"April 16, 2000 11:39PM",aling1,"There will be no 6.0L V12 for the new S600. It's only a 5.8L V12. MB seems to have moved away from their tradition of naming the model numbers after the engine displacement. Case in point, the '01 C240 that has a 2.6L V6 engine. Strangely, there is an E240 being sold in Europe and Asia that has a true 2.4L V6 engine."
168,"April 17, 2000 7:26AM",merc1,"That is strange isn't it? I have seen the E240 (2.4l V6) vs the Opel Omega on Auto, Motor, und Sport TV, but the C240 coming here has a 2.6L version of the same engine, but it's still badged the C240, go figure. Alas the cost cutters at MB have dictated that they can't build another robust V12 like before, so we're stuck with a 5.8, but a ""S580"" badge just wouldn't do so they ""round"" up.

M"
169,"April 17, 2000 3:27PM",kappaman,"I believe the contest was a little biased. The 750il is by all intensive purposes a great car, but we need to look at each vendors top car. Also consider v12 vs. v8 in the mix, as well as price. It should be BMW 750il,Mercedes S600,Audi S8,Jaguar Vanden Plas Supercharged,and Lexus LS430. My guess, technically the S600 or the 750il will win. Passionately the Jaguar, my choice for my needs. Although the Mercedes CL500 wouldn't be bad for a sedan choice. Out of the S600 and 750il for prestige the Benz,for passion and user friendliness the 750il. Personally, I'm waiting to see what Jaguar does with its new version of the XJ and BMW with its 7-series. Seen the S, no thank you. CL yes, S no. Audi, no thank you, Lexus, no thank you. For my own reasons the Jag, Benz and BMW. Lets look at warranties offered, customer satisfaction reports(J.D. Powers, Intellichoice, etc...)and other factors like presence, and styling.
Also, Edmunds I love ya, but stop bashing the Jags so much. I've own the 740il, S-class,and a couple of Lexus. They all have strengths and weaknesses. Owning them is different than reading and forming opinions. Let ask owner. Any other owners of the various brands out there."

173,"April 22, 2000 5:56AM",scongro,"I agree with you the S580 just sounds horrible, plus the public knows the name, S600. When an older S600 drives through my town(not too often, once a week or so), it turns a lot of heads. I don't think that anyone will think of it as a lesser car because it has a 5.8. Besides, other than Acura, Lexus is the only company that has kept with the displacement badging, even when an engine changes(ES 250-300 & LX 450-470). However it will be interesting to see what Lexus does if they ever make a smaller engine for any of ther cars. I don't see that happening anytime soon, since Lexus doesn't have any enormous engines, like the V12."

Shame on you JAG.
Well kudos for JAg for using a MB transmission that's supposed to be marginally better than theirs.
and BMW using GM transmission in their current BMW 3 series and 5 series cars.

regarding the resemblance in design between the MB s-class and the LEXUS ls430, i think it is a trend of the industry to have a piece headlights.
the toyota supra had that since '93.

regarding the imitation of the cars, i think major german and japanese auto manufacturers copy each other. and then the other european or asian manufacturers copy each other.

181,"May 2, 2000 12:30AM",aiman,"In my humble opinion, major corporations keep close eyes on their competitors moves so that they can outdo or not get outdone by their competitors. A simple example is the GM Onstar which was introduced a few years ago. Similar devices are now available on MB and Lexus (Lexus Mayday). Soon other manufacturers will compete providing this feature to their products. Eventually, they will compete by providing it to many econo cars. While some fans of certain manufacturers dislike this type of competitiveness since they cannot claim somekind of exclusivity of the brand they adore, most other consumers will only benefit from this and get better value out of their cars.

Happy motoring"

I saw the 2002 Q45 at the New York auto show and while I haven't decided if I like it or not I can definitely say it doesn't copy the Benz (see the new Lexus LS430 for that). With 340 hp the new Q45 is returning to the roots of the first generation Q45 and away from the Buick-like path of the current Q45 (in my opinion - I'm sure there are those who love the current Q).

The others brands are not really anymore reliable, trust me. They all have their problems that are particular to them. Besides, Jaguar has the best warranty in the business. If you buy pre-owned you can get 6years,100k miles from original sales dates. So, you can actually get a better warranty on a used one(year of two old) than you can on a new one. Truthfully, either choice will be good. They all are GOOD cars...notice I didn't say great. Go with what you really want,no matter what it is. You are the one paying for it.

btw, is your real name budfox or are you as big a fan of the movie wall street as I am? :>

- Rob"
199,"May 22, 2000 8:28AM",merc1,"Rob114 is correct. These are all great cars. You owe it to yourself to find a dealer (of each brand) that will let you maybe keep a car for a weekend. It can make all the difference in the world.

Now on those choices. If you're satisfied with BMWs then get the 740i Sport, the 2001 models are on sale now, plus you can now get the Sport package on the 740iL if you need the room in back. Your dealer is correct, the 2002 will be all-new. BMW is notorious for giving their cars a face-lift for the last model year and they stick behind their cars until the very end. Hence the 2001 7-Series' facelift. Another plus to BMW doing this is that when the 2002 is shown (about next year this time) you might be able to tell from the pictures of the new car whether or not you like it, and the 2001's will still be around for you to get one if you like.

The A8 is one of my favorite cars, but like the 740i it has aged, although it's not as old as the 7-Series. Quattro and all Aluminum construction make it the ""different"" one here. I personally am excited about the S8, but your wife may not want this ""sports"" model. The long-wheelbase A8L is probably the one to go with here.

I don't like Lexus' cars so I'll just say that the LS430 promises to be a great car if oh-so derivative of a Mercedes. Loaded with features too, like the S-Class.

Lastly, ahh the S430. Very good, but not enough power for me. Probably enough for you and your wife, but I would (if possible) make the stretch to the S500 if I were buying an S. The S-Class is to me the best looking of the bunch with all the features you'll ever need in a car.

Take a lot test drives, your favorite will emerge I'll bet on it. Good luck.

Although I presently on Jaguars, I would recommend the new S-class to someone in the market for highline luxury cars. My reason is that it is the only newly developed one in the pack.

As far as the ride is concerned, the S-class has it beat though. I felt a little shake in the steering column. I notice things like that in cars. My XK8 does the came thing sometimes. It may have something to do with the tires, I don't know.

Budfox057,

Ok this is how they do it. The 2001 7-Series just went on sale, and it has body-color molding and trim now plus more standard equipment....even though the car has about 16 months to go. The did the same thing in 1995 with the 5-Series. The upgraded it for the 1995 model year and then the 1997 (no 1996 models were made) model came out spring of 1996. I like the way they do it personally, they wring everything they can out of a design before changing it, and the customer almost always benefits from this. Have you driven any one of your choices yet?

The only problem is that so many other Merc owners who are disenchanted with the Mitsubishi-[non-permissible content removed] Toyota-[non-permissible content removed] Mazda styling of the new ""S"" are also on the prowl for the old body style. There is a now a shortage of ""old"" S's!! Who'd a thunk it?

The 740il is the best around luxury car made to me, but ours had a lot of electrical problems. The Jaguar Vanden Plas is something special. We call it our ""Baby Rolls"", and as far as reliability is concerned, we had more problem out of the 740il than we do with the Jag. No really many problems with the Jag at all to tell the true.

We look at the new S, and just can't do it. We are fairly young too, but the retro on the big Benz does quite work. It remind me more of the 740il. The old problem you have in my mind is that the BMW and Jag are both going to change styles in the new year or two.

As to the fixation on ""Toyota,"" I've been saying that the Celsior (LS400) is Toyota's flagship.
It isn't.

ES300 topic:

#104 of 105: Crown (jrct9454) Mon 29 May '00 (06:50 AM)

The Crown has always been their flagship car,
intended for the corporate mucka-mucks who are
driven in the back seat. Styling in the past couple of decades clearly is designed to appeal to the local market, and the car has rarely been sold in any significant numbers outside Asia. Think S-Class by way of Maybach...with doilies on the headrests and a bodyguard in the front seat...


Toyota is one of a handful of companies that have the ability to make V-12 cars from the ground up.
LS400 is the highest build quality of any car being sold in the US. You'd better research the glass, the specifications to which it was made, who made it, and where else it might be used instead of jumping on the fact it says Toyota."
227,"May 31, 2000 1:35PM",kappaman,"isn't that big of a deal, but if they want to differentiate the luxury line, they should put Lexus on or take Toyota off the glass. It does turn some protential buyers off. No matter, a Lexus is a Lexus. A high quality, reliable, plainly designed, copy of a Mercedes. It is an excellent auto,and if reliablity is what you seek in a luxury car, the Lexus is the best. On the other hand, if you want some style or/and prestige to go with your luxury, along with pretty good reliability, look at Jag,Mercedes, or BMW. No matter which one you choice, you'll be making a good choice. They all hold something unique to themselves."
228,"May 31, 2000 4:00PM",bmwaaron,"All I meant by the glass comment was that if they are such great cars, and status symbols, they could at least make glass that has the same name as the car. Even Acura and Infiniti have glass named after the car, not the parent company that made it."
229,"May 31, 2000 4:46PM",mmcbride1,Wanna bet? My 2000 Infiniti I30 says NISSAN on the glass. Not Infiniti. And I still bought it.

233,"June 1, 2000 5:14AM",automophile,"It says ""Toyota"" because the Lexus is a Toyota in Japan where it is made and in most of the rest of the world. It is only a Lexus in the USA to escape import restrictions, the same as Infiniti and Acura. Also - Toyota is probably the maker of the glass.

Some auto glass says ""PPG"" (Pittsburgh Plate Glass)or ""LOF"" (Libbey-Owens-Ford) - 2 of the largest suppliers to the auto industry. Does this mean that the the cars that use it are cheaper or less good in some way? I don't think so.

Sounds like Lexus-bashing to me!"
234,"June 1, 2000 1:34PM",kappaman,"Its not really Lexus-bashing(which I have good reason to do because of my Lexus experience), it just may make some folks think, ""why should I pay and extra $20k for a car that says Toyota just like their Camry"".

Since we are talking about these cars Lexus ES300 is a rebadged Toyota Windom and not Camry. How many times have I told you grasshopper. In fairness to the gentleman Windom and Camry share parts ""less than 25%. "" The glass might be one of those parts."

I have owned 2 Lexus product(ES & SC), both had Toyota on the glass. Wasn't that big of a deal to me. Understand, I do not hate Lexus.

Now, the 5 vs. new C-class is a hard one for me. I could think of many reason to choice one over the other. The facelift thing I understand now, so I guess that give the 5 one more point in my mind.
Good luck in your decision."
247,"June 4, 2000 2:01AM",benjamins,"Agreed. Nothing feels as solid, stable. However, I feel Mercedes feels a bit hard because of this. Doors or hefty, controls are higher effort. There is a silkiness in a Jag or a Lexus that is missing in the Mercedes. Mercedes, for that reason, always feel like high speed trains (or how high speed trains should feel) to me. BMW's do also, not as hefty.

Mercedes age well. For me, Mercedes make sense in Germany, at ultra high speeds. But for me, there is stiffness in the car, well oiled stiffness, but a bit of it is there. I like Audis, seem less stiff and I actuall find the fit and finish best of all German cars currently."
248,"June 4, 2000 2:22AM",benjamins,"Ok, fine, maybe the Lexi look like Mercedes and copied them from without. But what about within? That's where you are when driving or being driven in them. Mercedes and Lexus look and feel nothing alike from within. Lexus looks and feels, and always has, decidedly Japanese. Soft Japanese textures, Japanese hues and colors, Japanese egonomics, switch gear etc. My complaint about Lexus is that there is still too much Camry evident in their highest quality cars. They don't quite look rich enough, but they sure feel wonderful.

The cars also differ suspensionwise and how they work out the important things. To me, so what, if Lexus copies Mercedes to some degree. Inside Lexus is very much Japanese, if not necessarily distinctive Japanese (although I feel the GS series is more distinctive within)"

The pre-1997 Q's also represent a much more performance oriented bang for th buck buy than an LS400. Even the new Q's offer much more for your money than the lexus.

My opinion based on Ford/Lincoln products and tryng to make a Jag instead of Jag doing it. Although the C&D compare of the more recent 40k cars, didn't favor Volvo, Jag, or LS. If the LS is anything to go by, it certainly doesn't feel like a Jag, nor any European car. Heck even the Stype doesn't feel like an XJ6 old or new. It may handle like one, but doesn't feel like it overall. I don't think just handling makes a car, hell the Mustang handles well too, it's RWD just like most police cars and most performance cars. The Q45t handles well also and is more of aluxury car than the LS and sounds more refined, etc.

As far as NAV goes, I read Audi has 3 overall. 1 in the instrument cluster currently. 2 Screen console type, that been out for a while in Europe and read is standard in the AllRoad 3 is supposed to give voice, screen, and something else, I have to find the site again."

They all have some reliability issues(even Lexus,though it is the most reliable overall). They all are over-priced, over-estimated, and overly written about. I'm a firm believer that you really don't know a car until you have driven it for a year of so. Test drives only give certain clue, you can't trust most people word about their cars because they lie to save face, a lot of writers are bias and comparisons are skuwed. Basically, its a crap shot. You really won't know if you like the car until you drive it daily. You may like the design, but seats, radio,a/c, handling and so on come experiencing to auto. On the other hand, J.D. Powers and other give you the basics to go by.

Now that I've said all that, buy what you like. I bought a Benz, because it was what you by when you get some money. I bought the Lexus because their reliability was tested(Toyota) and I like the name. I bought the BMW because it was the best all around in features , handling,looks etc. I bought the Jaguars because I have been in awe of Jaguar since I was about 16 years old. It was my dream car.

In terms of not introducing anything, you and I spend, perhaps, too much time on design. Toyota is one of the premier engineering companies in the world.

In terms of build quality, from a German car perspective (and that's my state of mind this summer), an LS400 doesn't have vault like solidity. On the road, it is competent, but it's no Audi. Build quality, however, refers to the

(i know a single test cannot determine crashworhiness, but it is a good determination of front end collisions). i would assume the LS and S type perform in a similar manner. what surprises me most about the rigidity issue is the A6. the passat, which shares the platform performed better. this seems like an oversight on Audis part, since crashworthiness is very important to luxury car buyers.

I'm sorry, I thought that I'd answered the ES300 seats question. The ES300 was our first luxury car. I bought it for our first anniversary. Anyway, I can't remember the seats honestly. I was just happy to own a Lexus at the time. We only kept the car for about 9 months because of the air conditioning problems we had, which Lexus refused to fix. We sold the car to a Lexus dealer in Orlando and loss about 3000 dollars. Not a good anniversary gift. Sorry I couldn't be more help.

I hope you are enjoying your Jaguars. People always player hate on Jaguars. I see you have already seen that. Beauty is often attacked. Anyway, I've really enjoyed my Jags. They are ""crowd pleasers"" amost anywhere my wife and I go. I guess you have to own a Jaguar to truly appreciate its charm. No they are not the most technically advanced, but who cares, they are special. Exotic by nature and often leaving people in a state of awe. Good luck with the Jags.

Your post made no sense to me. He wanted to race under the name Mr. Mercedes therefore his daughter was named Mercedes? What? I thought the daughter was named Mercedes and Mercedes was chosen because it was believed to have market appeal in South America or somewhere because it did not sound German. It is improbable that Daimler and Benz invented the car and the real story is that one name was dropped in favor of anyone's daughter's name. If I made your point for you I am glad to have done it.

361,"July 4, 2000 1:13PM",dave203,"As an engineer & car buff I think this is an excellent topic of discussion. Is it correct to say that one is better than the other because its more expensive ? I have driven all three and bought one of them. Also I did not make my decision based only on the test drive, but also on other research.
I went with the most reliable of the three. I will say this though. The BMW 740 has excellent performance and handling for a car its size. What drew me away were horror stories I heard about 7-Series complex electrical systems. For the most part these cars are trouble free however electrical problems on a 740 is something I wish on no one. A friend of mine bought a preowned ""certified"" '94 740 and within weeks the dashboard was all lit up like a Christmas tree with problems and the starter motor went bad. The cost to fix all the problems would have added up to nearly $3000. Great engine & powertrain & performance but the electrical system can be a nightmare if you happen to be unlucky.
Mercedes Benz is very solid, vault like construction, long lasting car again reliability is not the best contrary to many peoples' opinion, again due to problems mostly with the electrical system. My fatherhad an older ('90) Mercedes 300E. It broke down once - the thermactor pump (ie smog pump) seized up at 110K miles while driving, caused the serpentine belt to pop off & the car died within minutes (no alternator)so much for the Mercedes brand. Again these cars have excellent engines & powertrains but the problems arise in the peripheral systems and they can be very troublesome and difficult to fix right. If I'm spending a lot of money on a car, it better be trouble free and it better last.
I own a '96 Lexus LS400. Never had a single problem, not the smallest thing. After 40K miles its still dead quiest and rides just like the day it was new. Very quick and smooth though I would like the suspension to be firmer/sportier. When I take it in for service the guy asks me "" Sir would you like coffee & danish while we rotate your tires"" ? Customer service reigns supreme. Lexus is the hands down winner of reliable, TROUBLE FREE luxury. Sure, if you have money to burn and like to brag, buy an S500 and good luck with the electrical system down the road or trade it in after 3 years for a new one if you want to avoid headaches. I plan on owning my LS400 for many trouble free years."
362,"July 5, 2000 3:04AM",kappaman,"I have owned the S-class,740il,ES300 and SC300. Never owned the LS400, but my Lexus experience was not as rosy as yours. True, the S and 7 have electrical problems,and moreso the 7. True, the 7 is the best handling and sportier of these cars. True, for bragging rights, one should by the S-class over the 7 and LS. But reliablity and customer service in my Lexus experience was not at that good. ES had seat memory problems, and the a/c shunk like hell after about 3 months of ownership. After about 6 additional months of bad service and Lexus refusing to fix the a/c, I sold the car for a major loss. My SC300's only major problem was condensation in the headlights. I had a wreck in the car and they could not fix is right. The transmission was messed up after that. Some times it would take me a couple of minutes to get the car in reverse. I didn't want to deal with Lexus not handling errors well again so I got rid of the car.

Lexus for the most part is more reliable than the others. The way they handled their errors was not acceptable though. The best customer service I've had has been from Mercedes and Jaguar(which I own presently:Vanden Plas and XK8). The Jags have been fairly reliable to.

You make good points about the cars and why you chose the Lexus. Makes sense. Most people who buy luxury cars though, are not thinking reliablity first. They are thinking prestige first. A short (2 to 3 year) lease handles the reliability issue for the most part. Although I enjoyed driving the Lexus products, they're not S-class, 740il or Jaguar. Prestige and heritage. People still look for these intangibles in automobiles. My Lexus experience was horrible, but most people seem to have good experiences. Logically, the Lexus should be the no.1 choice, if you exclude prestige and heritage.

For all of us who send 60k plus on a car, we're burning money. Reliability can be had with an Accord or Camry at 20k. We really want the prestige that goes with driving an LS, S, 7 or Jag. Excluding my experience, if I was going to buy one of these cars to keep for the long run, the Lexus is the choice, hands down in engineering.

Basically, all I am saying is that they all have major shortcomings. I would advice anyone to buy what the like, period. They all have disappointed me in some way, but I will probably always own a luxury car. Good luck with the LS."

367,"July 7, 2000 1:38AM",jwarnes,"First, a sad story. My MY 2000 S-430 has only 6500 miles on the odometer. It has incurred over $10,000 USD of warranty repairs - for example: the struts have been replaced multiple times, sway bars too, other parts of the redesigned suspension system, the instrument cluster (the numbers 10 20 30 for mph were flaking off), 2 steering wheel sensors, seat belt retractors, sun roof resynchronization, cell phone attenuators, cd player twice etc. I understand from my repair technician that MB is having lots of problems with the new suspension system.

There is one remaining problem which is rather vexing and I was wondering if any other S-430 owner has experienced the same problem.

I have a 6-disc cd changer in the trunk. Whenever I reinsert the magazine into the player (because I changed the discs) the car forgets were it was over an engine restart. Example: when I shut off the car, disc 4, song 5 is playing. When I restart the car it resets to disc 1, song 1. After a couple of days (and not removing or reinserting the magazine) the car remembers where it was when the engine was turned off and will not fail again until the magazine is ejected and reinserted.

MB acknowledges the problem and has replaced the cd player twice. This has not corrected the problem.

I told them that the new cd players did not fix the problem and asked them to diagnose further. They are not willing to look into it anymore - essentially saying to me ""learn to live with it, it's working as designed"" which of course is not true. They also said the MB engineering is aware of the problem in a subset of cars and its very low priority with respect to fixing it. I am contemplating contacting the our state's consumer protection board or pursuing the lemon law (I believe that my aggregate set of problems might qualify me for relief).

Any other S-CLASS owner having this same problem. Have you been able to have it resolved?

It does seem that I found a work around - after reinserting the magazine, I sequentially choose disc 1, let it play for a few seconds, pick disc 2, .... pick disc 6 and then the car remembers where it was from the 'get go'.

Thanks in advance for any responses. Objectively, this is my last Mercedes. (Just picked up a BMW X5 SAV as a second car and it is incredible!)"
368,"July 7, 2000 2:27AM",scongro,"Let me see if I understand this problem:

Thu have 6 Discs in the magazine. You pull the magazine out, to replace the discs, and then the CD Player starts over at Disc 01, Track 01.

If this is the problem, then you have no problem. The CD Changer is supposed to start over at Track One anytime you remove the magazine.

However, if this isn't your exact problem, pleace clarify."

a while ago you mention reliability as a no factor for rich folks with money to burn. I'm not rich but I think yes, it matters even for rich folks. While money to repair is not the main issue, putting up with going to the dealers often and driving their loaner car is not the lavish lifestyle one dreams about.

Having a 60-70k luxury vehicle that needs repairs often makes you think is it prestigious or a sloppy workmanship? Prestigious items has excellent workmanship as well. Unless, of course, prestigiousness only applies to sheet metal shape, dash design, and brand recognition.

I'm not implying that non-lexus luxury brands are totally unreliable, but just pointing out importance of reliability.

Just my humble 2 cents."
376,"July 12, 2000 5:01PM",kappaman,"I think you missed my point. I'm not saying that reliability is a none factor. It is quite important, and is part of what makes luxury luxury. However, you have Jaguar enthusiast, Mercedes enthusiast,BMW enthusiast, and so on. None of these car are as reliable as Lexus is SUPPOSE to be. My Lexus experience did not prove that Lexus was anymore reliable than my Benz,Bimmer or Jag way really. I would say that I had a few less problems with the Lexus than the others. On the other side, customer service is also part of the luxury experience. It was here that Lexus came in 3rd place. BMW's customer service has worst than Lexus. Jaguar and Mercedes have given the best customer service.If was quite familiar with the Lexus lobby, and their loaner cars, which at first were Toyota Corolla. Later they gave my Lexus loaners.

Aiman, I'm not rich either. 60k-70k for a car is still expensive to me to, but I've been fortunate to be able to afford them. Honestly, it is more prestige than anything that lured me to these cars. Not reliabilty, not safety, but luxury and prestige. Each of these car companies and products have advantages and disadvantages over the others. It really what you like. For anyone that whats the car for the long run, I would recommend the Lexus, period. For prestige, the Jaguar or Benz, and for the experience of driving a excellent piece of machinery, the BMW is the ""ultimate driving machine"". Thats a fact.

By the way, your 2 cents is always welcomed."
377,"July 12, 2000 10:32PM",stealth7,"Dear Gentelemen and Ladies!

Please don't think that I'm rude - I'm just trying to be fair.
Personally, I'm a BMW fan and I'm 6'4"" tall. I'll tell you later why this is important.

1. Image.
MB - just about everything - image! Never saw MB drivers pushing hard! From this point of view - S500/S600 just the matter of prestige. Moscow itself has more S600 than REST of the world combined! Why? Because new Russians want to show that they are rich! That's it! Nothing else matters! ""MB drivers want to be seen behind the wheel, but BMW drivers want to drive"". True!
So, if you want to show others how rich are you - buy a MB, if you want a car to drive - buy BMW.
Jag - even Vanden Plas can't accomodate me! I was out for XJR 2 times, but not even a chance to fit! So, if you are taller than 6' - forget about Jag.
2. Performance.
MB - do not pay attention to performance data!
MB always posts the data which could be possibly squized from the car at ideal condition with super driver behind the wheel!
Example? Just some latest from Automobile magazine. MB claims that ML55 does 0-60 in 6.5 sec. BMW claims that X5 (regular with 4.4 engine) does this in 7.5. Actual test shows that acceleration wise they are basicly the same! So, ANYBODY in X5 can make it in 6.8 and NOBODY in ML55 in 6.5! And this is a point.
BMW claims 740i - 6.9 and Sport Package in 6.8. Actual results for Sport - 6.1 auto and 5.8 if you push it hard!
However, I never checked for latest S500. But I tried 740 vs. S500. On paper they are identical. But we almoust CRASHED Mersedes trying to perform simple for BMW ride.
3.Power.
Who told you that S600 is most powerful? By absolute quantity of horse powers? Well, 389 for latest SL600 and 0-60 in 5.7 for the coupe. XJR has 370 (and not from V12) and 5.4 for the sedan!
BMW M5 has 400hp. So, what? What about hp/lbs ratio? Conclusion - power is not a point. Torque maybe, but not power! Actually, power is just amount of heat prodused by engine when burning a fuel. Nothing about ability to spin the tires.
4.Reliability.
Nothing is perfect. German cars are famous for mechanical superiority and ... electrical problems. Which is TRUE. But that was BEFORE. Not NOW. You can experience some - but not likely and those problems are not crucial.
These days NOBODY BUYS luxury cars! They are all leased! Who cares about broken bulb if everything covered by warranty and you have excellent service, complimentary ride or a free car (I enjoy driving 328i with Steptronic during regular maintanence stops) to play with?
5. Which one?
MB - if you want the image and prestige.
BMW - if car is for you, but not for gawkers. Looks like for now much more people prefer BMW over the MB. Or should I say DC - Daimler Chrysler? Ford killed the Jag, don't you think same could happen to MB? BWT, Daimler trademark belongs to Ford, am I right?
JAG - I have no clue. Old style was good. New one looks and, probably is, the clearly Ford. To me it's hard to imagine somebody who wants to pay 70K for the Ford. I never tried to drive XJR which is only one I ever wanted from Jag's line, but believe me, Jeep Crand Cherokee handles and performs better than XJ8! Amazing but true!
LEXUS - buy it if you are a broker or Real Estate agent. Car is good, fast, reliable, not overpriced. So, if you want to show how SMART are you paying only 50K for the ""same"" car, if you don't need visual impact of a MB, if you don't need superiority of a BMW, if Japanese car for 50K doesn't hurt you budget - Lexus is for you!"
378,"July 12, 2000 10:49PM",stealth7,"About month ago I faced the same problem.
I leased 740iSport for several reasons.
1. 2002 7 series most likely will be available only in about 2 years.
2. I don't want to get just released car. I want a polished one. So, after a year in production.
3. Just arrived cars are always way too expencive. No special leases, no ability to nagotiate.
4. 740i Sport 2001 is a SUPERB car. Nothing comes even close. Maybe I'll extend my lease after 24 month. This car is SOOOO GOOOD!"
379,"July 13, 2000 6:29AM",ferarri11,"what are your thoughts on audi. to me this car is much more a car for you and not for impressing people on the street. better interiors than either BMW or MB, more functional than Jag. same performance as MB and BMW give or take a few tenths for all (MBs are usually the worst of these three in handling). Audi costs thousands less too.
i have to disagree about the Jag comments, the new S type looks and feels like a jag, though the interior is a bit anonymous, less wood and more plastic.
BMWs are also about impressing people, as much as MB. also, MB hasnt released the S600 yet so you must be refering to the old body. where did you get this statistic, it seems so obscure. i'd like to find info like this too."
380,"July 13, 2000 6:33AM",ferarri11,"it seems silly to buy a car based on its prestige. you should buy a car that you like, regardless of what others think. i personally would not buy a car that i didnt love just because it is the latest BMW or MB. that's silly and shallow. you should have your own prestige, a car cant give that to you. people who do things like this have low self esteem, and vicariously feel powerful and important through the car. most people can see through this. anyways, if you buy a car based on prestige, you are a fool to marketing. that's all prestige is, really, just good marketing. and only the vulnerable succomb to this."
381,"July 13, 2000 6:38AM",merc1,"Interesting post. However Mercedes performance figures have traditionally always been on the conservative side. Are you saying that there is no substance behind a MB and it's just a nameplate/star? Chrysler and MB will never share platforms for a Mercedes-Benz badged car. That was part of the agreement from the beginning. If the ML55's numbers were off (and there is some question to that) it will be the first time that has happened, because usually MB cars test much faster in regular road tests (no super driver) than MB factory numbers indicate. Don't get me wrong. BMW is also a favorite of mine, but over the long run they have way more problems than Mercedes cars, and they are more expensive to repair.

383,"July 13, 2000 9:18PM",kappaman,"Maybe I'm silly, maybe I'm shallow, maybe I have vunerable to marketing(actually I'm a marketing guy myself), but call me blessed to while your at it. While it is true that prestige played the major role in my buying these cars, I've experienced owning the top level luxury cars(S-class,740il,Jaguar Vanden Plas and XK8, and Lexus ES and SC). Not many people can say that, or that they would not like to experience that. When I see what people write about these cars, I know if they are being truthful, or if they are defending a car just because they bought it.

As far as self esteem is concerned, I probably have one of the biggest egos of anyone I know, and with good reason. Your comments kind of remains me of what poor people say about what rich people buy and do. ""I wouldn't do this, that, or the other, if I had that much money"". You said that people should buy what they wanted. Well, I wanted a Benz,Bimmer,Lexus, and Jaguar, so I bought them. Why I wanted them is irrelevant. Don't really see what that has to do with you.

As far as a feeling of power is concerned, I have a black belt and can bench press over 350lb. Thats powerful enough for me. The cars didn't make me money. Money made me able to buy to cars. The power is in having the money. The Golden Rule. To the feeling of importance thing, I've been in the spotlight in one way or another see I played little league baseball. My feeling of importance draws me toward luxury items. I feel that this is what I deserve. Shallow, maybe. Silly, maybe.

Since, I've been on edmunds, I've never out and out insulted anyone. I have defended myself own several occasions however. We are talking about cars, and even shallow little me knows that this conversation does not warrant insulting anyone character. Its all good though. Peace."

385,"July 13, 2000 9:46PM",kappaman,"We tend to make our own rules as we go along. He who has the gold rules their destiny in the real world more so than those who don't. Money give you freedoms that nothing else does, except spirituality. Its money that allow you to retire, travel, and actually get away with murder sometimes. It allow you to pay people off, get the best seats, etc...Pros and cons. No its not the answer to life, but it can make it a lot more enjoyable. You don't hear very many people with money complaining about it, but those without often do. And if you are wondering, I'm far from what I call rich monetarily. Success is a journey not a destination, and money make the journey a little sweeter. Just my way of looking at it. Thats my Golden Rule. Just I customized it to me my needs."
386,"July 14, 2000 2:00AM",marsha7,"the LOVE of money is the root of all evil. I think Kappaman has it straight and true. He has apparently made money, and money was meant to be used, as long as it does not become your God, philosophically speaking (I am not preaching religion to anyone). Kappaman is also right when he (?) speaks about poor people who comment on what (relatively) rich people do with their money, as though they had any qualities to criticize those who have more than they do. Kappaman enjoys his money, spends it on cars, and is apparently blessed to do so. Money buys you freedom from material want, and I hope to be in that situation someday myself."
387,"July 14, 2000 2:04AM",stealth7,"Right! Audi! Beautiful Car! Actually first Audi Coupe was the first car I was crazy about. And than...
1. I've red a lot about. Technological marvel. Aluminum body, space frame, all-wheel drive, unique design, 300hp... I started to fond...
2. I checked the car at expo. Impressive! Fit and finish, materials, front seat space - outstanding!
3. Friend of mine purchased cabrio, I believe '97 with 172hp. Supposed to be more than enough for such a small car, but actual driving experience TO ME was extremely dissapointing. Mostly because of lack of power, especially at low revs. I started to criticize... Oh, BTW, later he was trying to improve performance by tuning and even got it S badged. But to me, only the badge was actual improvent. He sold the car after about 6 months.
4. New A6 came on the market. I visited dealer and took car for a ride. Even worth! With such lack of power (200hp on paper) even Tiptronic was absolutely useless. And when I tried back seat - I got TRAPPED! No kidding! I barely was able to get out!
5.My wife was crazy about A8. So, we went to get one. I tried and ... WOW! What a car! Everything was just right, but only from the driver's seat and that's why:
a)That car was black on black and to me interior was even more spartan that on old MB.
b)Sound was terrible.
c)Don't remember exactly now, but something was wrong with a/c.
AND FINALLY - that car was the WAY more expensive than S420, 740 or Vanden Plas! Surprise? Not really. In 1999 Audi sold less then 2300 cars (A8) in USA and this with very aggressive advertisement campaign, free cars for celebrities etc. I think that only relatively successful A4 allows Audi to stay in business in the US.
SO, LEASE COST on Audi was about 30% higher than for the equally priced car (68K) from MB, BMW or Jag!
Now comes decision making process:
1. Is Audi better looking? Not really.
2. Is Audi faster? Not really.
3. Does it have the appropriate prestige recognition? Definitely not.
4. Does it have more power? Better handling? Better safety? Again not really.
5. Am I crazy about interior? Not really.
6. Do I want to pay 30% more for it? NO!

MY CONCLUSION - no more Audi! I emphasized this intentionally - this is ONLY MY opinion!

Everything is a matter of personal preferences, blonds or brunettes, Canon or Nikon, MB or BMW ...
Actually, such kind of discussion has no point at all. I'll never be able to convince MB owner that BMW is better and otherwise..., so I'm just expressing my OWN perception, just because somebody may find this interesting or useful...

And new Jag's S-series, again to me, looks just like a slightly polished latest Taurus. Take a closer look - you'll notice!"
388,"July 14, 2000 3:33AM",kappaman,"You seem to be one of the only people on edmunds who understand where I'm coming from. Money give you certain freedoms, and I believe you should enjoy them. Waiting for the million that you will have at retirement from IRAs,401ks,etc is not the answer to me. What is a 62 year old man with a million dollars going to do? Spend it on a 20 year old slut probably. Of course you can appreciate money at any age, but probably a little more in your youth and middle age. Besides, who knows how long we are going to be on earth. Today may be that rainy day. Planning for tomorrow, but enjoying today.

My true happiness comes from my beautiful and pregnant wife,and 2yr old daughter. Family has always been the thing that meant the most to me. I believe family is what life is really all about.

Back to cars. I think that most people who buy luxury cars are doing so for prestige as well as luxury, safety and so on. Peace."
389,"July 14, 2000 6:27AM",ferarri11,"the A8 costs so much because aluminum construction is pioneered on the car, and the research put into the car is vast. it seems overpriced, but audi loses money one every A8 they sell. i dont understand, at the beginning of you comment you loved the interior but at the end it is spartan. and the new A6 biturbo which is cheaper will beat a 528i or E320 in acceleration so the 2.8 is really a moot point.
i dont see why you think the new MB S is much better than the A8, check the CandD comparo, and the A8 does place it ahead, and their complaints about lack of leg space is remedied in the A8l. also it had the fastest acceleration. but enough about the A8. i dont think any of these cars are bad. it troubles me when people only buy things because they like to impress others or try to put on an image that really is hollow. if you like an MB, get it. if you like the jag, get it. but dont buy one because you want to impress the neighbors. i can tell if someone buys a car because they like it and a person who buys a car and wants to show everyone how rich they think they are. why do you think many of the richest people drive ordinary vehicles. bill gates drives an LS400. i doubt he drives it because it is prestigious or will impress the neighbors. they dont buy a car to put them into some esoteric league obtained by only a few, they dont care. it's a car and it made them happy.
kappaman-don t kid yourself into thinking that you've obtained some exalted status by driving the world's finest vehicles...for one thing, there are so many other things to do with your money. find a cure for cancer. feed the starving. and 6 different cars over the span of what 10 years, isnt that excessive esp when you obviously dont buy them because you like them but buy them because you think the neighbors will think you are rich. people so obsessed with self image and worth suffer from the narcissist complex. it's treatable. you could start by pleasing yourself and buying whatever you like regardless."
390,"July 14, 2000 8:28AM",ferarri11,"you all have to remember that audi's name was falsely tarnished by 60 minutes, and they later apologized for their poor reporting. in Europe, audis sell the same as MB and more than BMW. audi is still recovering from this, but with such good cars as the A4 and A6 and A8, they have created car that are better than MB and BMW. look at autosite, and for luxury pics, the A8 gets the ultimate pic twice, same as S class. and it is older. no 7 series. the A8 doesnt impress as much as the S class to people who dont know cars. it is class without flash and mass. the S class is a great car but has questionable interior plastic and a weird COMAND system. the A8 does have a better quality interior. MB and BMW quality are also not exactly stellar compared to audi...in consumer reports, the A6 and the E class had the same reliablility. it was only average. they dont mention the S class or A8. the S has horrible problems with the suspension and electricals now. the E has glitches after 4 years. the A6 has glitches too. the 5 has glitches. no cars have incredible reliability. all are good."
391,"July 14, 2000 8:36PM",marsha7,"While Kappaman can certainly defend himself without my help, I must add to your comments. I personally get annoyed at people who tell those who have money ""find a cure for cancer"" or ""feed the starving."" While those are noble causes, it appears that Kappaman wants to do something else with the money that, I assume, he earned. An old friend, a minister, (I am still not preaching religion to anyone) once told me, ""the best way to help the poor is to NOT be one of them."" He always spoke of prosperity to whomever he met. If I want to spend my money on a homeless shelter, I will. But if I want to spend that same money on a Jaguar, it will be just as well spent, because the money is mine, and spending it on ME is just as noble a cause as the shelter. It is one thing to be selfish. It is another to first take care of one's SELF (and family, if such exists)."
392,"July 14, 2000 10:10PM",kappaman,"It ain't that serious man. I ain't Bill Gates, so I don't have enough money to find the cure for cancer. By the way, no amount of money has yet. As far a feeding the homeless is concerned, I do. It is part of what I do as a KAPPAMAN. We also do voter registration, bone marrow donation drives, muscular dystrophy drives, toys for tots and so on. I also mentor the youth and college student. I'm not the super selfish guy you seem to think I am. Just because I like to buy expensive cars doesn't make me an a** hole. I'm really a nice guy...until I'm pushed.

Bill Gates driving a LS400 does mean much to me. Ophray driving an A8 does mean much to me. My driving a Jaguar mean a lot to me. You see I've want a Jaguar since I was about 15 years old. The only reason I waited to get the Jag is reliability concerns. When J.D. Power and Intellichoice gave them excellent report I took my chance with them, and they have been no less reliable that the other brand that I've owned.

ferrarri11, I am a legend in my own mind. I was that way when I was driving a Cutlass. My head was already pretty large. Remember, I told you I have the cars because I belief I deserve this type of luxury. Now I can afford them, so I have them. As far as seeking help, I married a woman with a psychology degree, and she helps me buy them. I know, we both need help.

One question for you ferrarri11. If you think luxury car buyer are crazy, why are you chatting about high end luxury cars, and what makes you think that I would pay this type money for a car that I didn't initially like?"

Ancient African secret. Not really worried about the economy, I have contingency plans for that. Besides, I put my faith in God, not the economy. I'll be alright, but thank you for looking out for me. ""Those who can do, those who can't teach"". I'm about doing what I want and can.

The cars are not where my happiness lay. I've had some problems with all them. They are material wealth. While nice, I understand they are not the keys to life. I have not had the fortune of my family having money for a century, but then again, ""God bless the child thats got his own"". We've done fairly well, and our offspring will benefit for years to come.

ferarri11, its obvious that we look at things differently. Thats cool with me. It takes all types. I'll accept you calling me shallow, silly, and all that other stuff. Hell, I can laugh at myself and actually may agree with you. Its all good, I ain't mad at you. I still will do my best not to insult you like that though.

I have a 98 740i. The car is fantastic, and it is such a pleasure to drive. The only regret that I have with the car is that I didn't get the iL.

I put 25 to 30 thousand miles a year on a car, and it ain't all highway miles, thats for sure. The reason you can buy it so cheap is because they depreciate rapidly. My 95 740il depreciated over 10k in one year, from 98-99. Don't get me wrong, it is to me the best overall sedan you can buy, if you don't get a bad one like I did(electrical nightmare). If you are going to pay it off and GET AN EXTENDED WARRANTY, its and excellent buy. Believe me you will love the car. BMW is the ultimate driving machine for real. Hopefully this helps you see both sides. And if you are going to get it from a Mercedes dealer, the Starmark warranty can't rival other dealers warranties. Starmark only gives you an extra year(5yrs) and up to 100k miles. After the 5th year you can pay for more warranty. Jaguar Select is 6yr up to 100k miles from original sale date. Most certified warranties give you 3yr up 100k miles from when you buy the used car, in the luxury lines. Ones again, hopefully this helps."

Lexus lovers will attack you about their cars. They know that a Lexus is a Toyota dressed up(Camry=ES300, Avalon=GS300, Land Cruiser=LX470, Solora=SC300). They know that Lexus copies the Germans blatantly(S-class=LS). They also know that a Lexus is one of the finest automobiles, if not the finest made.

Toyota dealer told me that the new Avalon was based on the GS. Solara looks too like my SC300 did. Maybe it isn't the same underneath. Anyway, those were just examples.
The main reason for my post was to say, ""People, it ain't that serious"". Lets agree to disagree with out and out insulting each other.

ferarri11,
I'm still on the Jaguars for now. I've about gotten the car thing out of my system. Had most of them already. I'll probably buy the next ES300 to keep a reliable car around and spurge on something else(newer Jag). As far as my electrical problems with the 740il: a/c and radio replaced, light bulbs replaced almost monthly, and one highlight replaced. If it wasn't for that I would probably still own it. It was the best all around car I have ever had, and the most fun (I really enjoyed the SC300 also). Oh, depreciation is horrible also. I'm an excellent negotiator, but I luck out getting out of that one."
432,"August 16, 2000 1:01AM",enigmaone,"The Avalon shares a platform with the Lexus ES300, Toyota Camry, Toyota Solara, Toyota Sienna. The GS-series has a totally different platform, due to RWD.

438,"August 20, 2000 7:10PM",muvseat,"Went to BMW dealer yesterday.Despite Edmund's saying there are no rebates on BMW the Dealer has 2500 toward a new 740il. I have the 740i with lease end Nov. 12 2000. They ""checked"" their used car dept. and appraised my car at 37K, the BMW on the phone buyout was 41k so a 4k difference. They would apply the 2500 to the difference and if I made a deal now to end the lease early, save myself two months payments of 1800 the dealer would lease the new 740il with sport package and convenience package for about the same as I pay now. However this entails a 6500 down payment.
This is all very confusing because I do not know the actual cost of the car. Sticker is 71,485.
Salesman thinks its good of course because the sport package and conventience package plus the elongated wheelbase is about 8500 more than what I have now and I would be paying 6500 for this. Good reasoning. I guess all prices are list and nothing do to with invoice. What do you think of the deal? Should I just wait out my lease and see what is availble in November. They are interested in moving cars, my car also because it has only 22500 miles. Appreciate any help. Thanks.
By the way the 1500 difference from the 4K diff. would probably be acceptable to the dealer."

441,"August 23, 2000 7:59PM",sysadb,"Muvseat,
If I understand your dealer's proposal correctly, he wants you to buy out your lease for $4k, and claims he is offsetting the buyout by a $2.5k ""incentive"". When the dust settles you will be driving a 740il w/sport pkg., etc., in place of your '98 740i with 22k miles. And you will do this for an upfront payment of $6500. Since you didn't mention what the new payment is on the 740il I can't comment with certainty on the attractiveness of the deal, but it's hard to justify (for most) lease buyouts. No matter how the dealer packages the deal the cost of the buyout is being passed to you.
This is probably the last thing you want to do, but with your low milage on the '98 you may want to consider the residual buyout of the car when the lease expires in Nov. Depending on what that figure is, you very well could make money on it by immediately selling it yourself. In any case, if you can wait till the lease expires you'll have more options. (Buy the 98 and sell it; buy the 98 and keep it; or turn in the 98 and buy or lease something else.) Remember the $2500 ""incentive"" the dealer said you were getting? Well, you can expect one in Nov. also - as a cap cost reduction on a new lease, or a discount on a buy. The salesman's validation of your $6500 down by pointing out that the 740il was $8500 more than a 740i was a smooth try, but when you lease you should only be paying for part of the cost anyway. You could put it to your salesman this way: ""So, you want me to amortize $6500 of the $8500 in a two(or three) year lease?""
On another point, if your 98 is as nice as one with 22k miles should be, then they aren't doing you any favors with the 37k appraisal...DB"
442,"August 24, 2000 4:56AM",muvseat,"Thanks for the comments. The base lease payment is calculated to be 1088.00 plus tax.The cap cost reduction of 6500 is the advertised one and obviously could be any number to change the lease payment. The salesman was just pointing out the increased cost of the new car over my old car and that the down payment which we would have given anyway if I came off the street is less than the msrp of the new options. When you plug in the numbers in a leasing program with the msrp of 71,485 for 24 months and 10k miles per year the lease payment is substanially more I believe.
What do you think now, I have three days to cancel my contract with BMW although I have not put any money down. The dealer is holding the car for me until Sat. Thanks again."
443,"August 24, 2000 8:25PM",sysadb,"OK. $6500 plus ($1088 + tax)/ month. (2 year lease). Is the buyout additional? I read your 1st post to mean that the dealer was offsetting the $4k buyout gap with a $2,500 incentive, leaving $1,500 for you to cover. Or, is the buyout eliminated by including it in the $6,500 down?
If the 740il (2000 model ?) is essentially costing you what is advertised, then you would seem to be in the ballpark, but I wouldn't pay extra to escape the current lease. I'm leaving now for a vacation and won't be checking for another week, so leave a post and let us know how it went.
You might also want to crunch the numbers on a buy instead of a lease. I don't have time to do it now, but that lease payment looks vulnerable. I understand you may wish to lease for reasons other than cost, of course. Good luck...DB"
444,"August 25, 2000 1:07PM",maumau5,"I'm looking into purchasing a luxury sedan, preferably the Mercedes-Benz S600.

In the meantime, I'm considering the BMW 750iL and Jaguar XJ8 Vanden Plas SC. I've heard that both automobiles are going to be drastically changed for their 2002 models.
I need a very roomy sedan and the Lexus, Infiniti, etc do not interest me. Maybe I should get a MB S500 for now until the S600 I want arrives. I don't like spending top dollar for an automobile that will be ""outdated"" in a year.

I don't know about your dealer, but the one near me, if they say wait 1 year, it probably means 2. So get the S500, it's a fine car. If you have extra money handy, get the Designo espresso and load up on options. This S model is going to last a long, long time."

Yes...I agree with you about how long I will have to wait for the S600. I ordered a BMW X5 in March and I am finally receiving it this week. What was supposed to be a 2-3 month wait turned out to be six long months. Too many options, maybe. I don't know.

I'm leaning towards the S500 because I think it is a very fine automobile, as you state. Load up on options? YOU BET! The BMW 750iL just doesn't appeal to me. Overpriced. I'm not a fan of BMW's in general, but I must admit that I like the X5. I had a Jaguar a few years back and really enjoyed the long drives I had to take from San Francisco to LA and back. It's a wonderful touring car.

I have no problem talking about cars with others, but please say stuff that makes sense.

For example, I would love for someone to tell me why the extra money is worth it for the Vanden Plas over the LS 400. I think the LS is a better car, and a lot cheaper."
451,"September 1, 2000 1:32PM",edspider1,"I hope Lexus doesn't read this forum. Sounds like there are lot of us that are really excited about the new LS. I've decided the LS is a better value than the S-Class. I've heard that even the current LS is quieter than the S-Class. Plus, I think I would prefer the smoother ride.

I don't feel like bashing the S. Its a fantastic car, too. The dashboard is better than the LS and the Command center's integration with a window in the dashboard is outstanding. But of course the new Lexus DVD nature is superior to the CD-ROM based Command Center.

Both are true luxury. Some prefer the quiet isolation of the LS, others prefer the ""presence"" of german luxury. The S-Class is not noisy and it's not rough. Its simply a different kind of comfort.

I'm also tired of all the pricing confusion of the new LS. The Ultra package sounds like it will add 8-10K to the base, but if you consider what it includes, its seems like a good value to me.

I think it unfortunate, but expected that the first deliveries will be Ultra equipped as I personally only want one option - GPS. I'm also bothered by the fact that they dumping the 2000 models at $5,000 off list. This causes me to see the 2001 as $5,000 more expensive than it really is.

453,"September 1, 2000 4:01PM",enigmaone,"And the reason the 2000 LS400 is selling for $5K off sticker right now is to get rid of the last of the very few 2000 LS400s that they are producing.

I am having a tough time deciding where to land in the MBZ S class line-up. I read the 2001 brochure and really like what I see on the new S55. However, I am not sure that will be the sportier S class it intends to be. I never had the pleasure of pushing any of the AMG tuned MBZ vehicles but hear raves. I am also concerned on how long the S55 will last as an offering and don't want to miss the boat. I think it may become a prize like the 500 E class.

Anyone have any thoughts on the S55 vs the S430/500. Think long term highway car with emphasis on power and comfort.

463,"September 21, 2000 7:21AM",merc1,"I think the best compromise, if you don't mind giving up a little power is the S500 Sport. The handling of the 2 shouldn't be too different. They both will last a long time, if maintained. I think the S55 will be around for the duration about the current S-Class, there may even be a supercharged version around the time the next AMG E-Class arrives (2004). The handling between the S55 and S500 Sport I would say is about the same, because there isn't much difference underneath, but of course the ""regular"" S500 will ride the best. I wouldn't get an S430, not enough power under the hood for the price. The 500E got so rare because it was a special project between Porsche and Mercedes-Benz.

498,"January 13, 2001 4:04PM",ejerod,"I'm the owner of both a 99Lexus GS300 and a 2001 Mercedes Benz S500 with the AMG sports package. I can attest that Lexus does indeed make wonderful automobiles but I chose the MB over the Lexus LS430 for various reasons other than the fact that I find the new LS430 body style to be a cross between the Toyota Avalon and the old model S class. For the life of me I don't know why Lexus didn't stick with blazing their own trail as they did with the GS which I love and the new SC430 ( which I may purchase ) Both these cars are gorgeous and you don't have to see the of the car to tell what they are. Mercedes has improved the build quality, the ride, the cost of ownership and everything else because of Lexus coming on the scene . So has BMW and the other traditional luxury car leaders. So we can all thank Lexus for that if nothing else. I bought the MB simply because I knew that I , like a few of my friends who bought the Lexus , would have been kicking myself in the rear end for not buying what I really wanted. I compromised before with my wife's car. I bought her the GS300 instead of the GS 400 with the navigation system. ""Who needs all that ? "" I said. This time around I just dug deeper into my piggy bank and bought what I really wanted, no compromise, no apologies, no regrets. It's like someone once said, ""One never regrets buying the best there is"" No truer statement has ever been said...I know that there are those that regret spending the extra money for the Benz, I'm not one of them. I'm always getting stopped in a parking lot, or having someone pull up next to me at a stop light and ask me to roll down the window so they can ask me something. I'm happily married but women of all ages go ape when they see this car. The LS430 never garnered that type reaction, but I have had some LS430 owners look at my car with the look of ""nice car"" written all over their faces. Both are wonderful cars, but in my book, and wallet, this year anyway Mercedes Benz wins hands down."

500,"January 15, 2001 5:07PM",ejerod,"If trying to decide to lease or buy there are many things to consider. I for example considered that the cost of ownership is less when leasing initially, but you usually lose with a lease on the back end unless you keep the car in immaculate condition ( which I do) and/or sell it yourself and keep the difference. keep in mind that when you lease there is usually a one year prepayment penalty if you pay it off the first year. I leased the car initially to be sure I wanted to keep it. I do so I'll pay it off after the prepayment clause is terminated. Some think leasing is the least expensive way to own a car. Well let's look at this example. Say you owna 95 MB S500. If it were paid for you could get nearly 30 in trade value, and if you were buying a new MB S500 at 90 K you drive off for 60, in an equity position, and with the advent of the new free maintenance agreement the cost of ownership as opposed to leasing is now negligible.

- dashboard illumination for the outside temperature gauge went out at 60k. $1200 to repair
- both right and left front bushings needed replacing at 55k
- head gasket leaked, entered cooling system at 70k. This meant the radiator and hoses ($2,200) had to be repaced. Plus the gasket.

The exterior of the MB is bland. I agree that the LS430 has similar exterior styling. The interior of the S class MB, though, is simply ugly. Why do you need to reach to your feet to use the window switches? What's with the impossible to see and use navigation system? What's with the thin cheap rear seats in the MB, -- without standard rear seat heaters! What are those funny buttons in a circle at the top of the dash? And, I simply love the speedo, which reminds me of my parents' buick station wagon when I was growing up.

My last car was the previous version S Class Benz, a loaded S500. When I saw the new model, I could not bear to buy it. Instead, I waited for the Lexus and am quite pleased at the comfort, power(not any slower than the S500) and ease to drive. And, this time, I pocketed the extra bucks, went to Maui, then Cabo San Lucas, and then got another plasma tv, with change. Sorry, guys, the new S Class is a loser."

511,"January 22, 2001 8:41AM",is4b2rd,"Well, I've been a Mercedes officianado since learning to drive in a 66 230SL. Up until the 2000 SC-lass, I think the cars have been the best engineered production vehicles in the world, and the increasing price reflected that. The previous SC-lass (W140) was unduly criticized for its size and bulk, but what an impressive vehicle. I did notice a decontening in that car from 1993 until 1999 model year, but still the car was awesome and impressive. The new SC-lass (W220) is a joke. I REALLY wanted to love the car. Yes, I think the styling is very sleek, but the interior is so cheap that it barely qualifies as a Korean car. The S600 does provide a bit more ""elegance"" but at a huge price. Mercedes built this car to a price point, whereas before the cars were built to the dream of the engineers. I realize that BB needs to make money and needs to sell more cars, but I would have hoped there would have been more of a compromise between price point and engineering. someone BB, hard plastic should NOT be a part of an SC-lass interior. Cover it up with soft materials for goodness sake. I am afraid that Lexus with their LS430 has increased their luxury quotient and the SC-lass has DEFINITELY lowered theirs. Very sad to see that happen, very sad indeed. If I were in the market for a sedan, the choices are the S-Class, LS430 and the NEW Jaguar XJ sedan that will be coming in a couple years. Friends, I am here to tell you, that car is going to outdo the S-Class, and priced closer to the LS430, I am afraid it will steal customers away from Lexus as well. The car is said to be a technological marvel and the body will be all aluminum and of course a more comfortable interior with those luscious Jaguar curves on the exterior. So, I would probably wait for the Jag. Barring the jag, if I could pull my head out and get over the ""prestige"" factor, I would choose the LS430, albeit with the full lux package.

MB can do it, they did a fine enough job on my CL500, which I do love and though the interior isn't up to the level of the previous generation coupe, it is yards ahead of the S-Class, possibly because of its full leather interior and my color choice of black, which can hide a multitude of sins in an auto interior.

Whichever car anyone chooses, it should suit their needs and desires, that's all that matters really. For me, I am just saddened to see Mercedes become just another car manufacturer. Guess that leaves Rolls-Royce, Bentley as cars to stive for as snob appeal. :-)"

Right now, I have a 1999 Kia Sportage EX, and like it well enough, although the payments are too high for the car. It's a good enough car, but not something I think I can keep for 10 years, and love. My parents have always had Mercedes Benz's, and have advised me to invest in something German.

Does anyone out there have this car, or anything to say (good or bad) regarding this car? Is maintenance super high on them? We have an old family friend who repairs MBZ's and BMW's, so I think I'll be okay there..... I hope.

The BMW with the M 18's is very nice on the eyes, but in this class is looking a little dated.

The Mercedes is very nice- two different schools of design between the Jag and MB, but both are extremely successful. With a sport package, the MB is hard to beat looks wise.

The Audi is again a little dated for this group. Although the S8 ups the ante.

And finally the LS430 is disgusting. Can Toyota not hire some designers with their own ideas. It is a complete rip off of the S-Class. And the old one at that! It should be illegal to massacre a great design like the MB, and slap a big L on it. Maybe it stands for LOSER!"

Had they done that with the new LS stying I would have bought it over the Benz S500. I'll admit that the Lexus is a great value, but I also have to agree that most people, men and women buy cars because of style and content , with style being in the top 5 of what's important to consumers.So Mercedes won this battle with the style and content, but the wars are far from over and we he consumers are the constant beneficiaries...."

I would almost agree with you on your assessment of the BMW 7-Series with the Sport Package, but with the S55 AMG around I can't say that the 7 is the best large sporting sedan anymore. The S55 is faster and better handling, and (I know you'll like this) better looking. I just wish the 750iL or 740iL actually got the suspension tunning of the 740i, instead of just the wheel/tire package. That said the 7 is still a favorite of mine, has been since the fall of 1994. It has that Mafia, ""Kingfish"" look about it. Any of these cars would do for me.

539,"February 8, 2001 1:19PM",arcoates,"This may be of some use to you- I'll throw it out there anyway. We had a 1995 XJ6 until September. Not the same engine, but bodywork, electronics, chassis etc...

Interior was gorgeous- no problems there. The I6 was a gem, as is the V8. The handling, although not a BMW, is very competent- when you push it, you are surprised at how it reacts. The tires on ours were very grippy (225 Pirelli P6000 with 16'), and the handling was very confidence inspiring.

In our experience, it is not a winter car at all. When we got rid of it, there were mutliple rust spots- not huge, but still there. We didn;t have the traction control, and there was no limited-slip diff, so it was hard to get it going in the snow, or even the rain!

If you're willing to have a winter car, or live in the sun, it is a great car. Beautiful, fast, great handling. The electronics acted up once in awhile, but it is a british car after all. I would reccomend it. If you're having passengers though, go for the long-wheelbase- the back is extrememly tight. Other than that- get one!

I hope this helps you.

The S-500 is a great car but the LS430 is in its league at $18-$25k less and to many including myself it's a better car. As for copycats I'll bet in near future the S-Class interior is significantly upgraded to match Lexus which simply blows it away today. And if it wasn't for the Lexus competition MB would still be giving its customers the vinyl like leather it had in its cars 10 years ago and the ride quality would never been improved. The truth of the matter is that these two cars are so close that it really comes down to whether you want the LS430's glorious ride and better then average handling or the S-Class' glorious handling but harder ride. After that it's that gorgeous interior of Lexus and far superior reliability vs. MB's stature and ""heritage"". However heritage doesn't influence me. Last time I looked Microsoft and Intel, despite serious drops in share price still had a higher market cap than IBM with all its heritage.

Be greatful these companies are in competition with each other as we the customers, regardless of our preferences, get better cars and have more choices."

A Mercedes in particular always had a good ride/handling tradeoff, Lexus had nothing to do with the ride of a Mercedes. If Mercedes was chasing Lexus' ride they would have the same lifeless handling too. My biggest problem with Lexus is the constant copying, it's ridiculous, and on top of that they copy an ""old"" Mercedes' look. Silly.

Get a VDP for sure- the extra wheelbase is well worth it. And those aeroplane style picnic tables are great! If you get a standard wheelbase, the people in the back will be uncomfortable- I know from personal experience. The only reason to get the reg. wheelbase would be to opt for an XJR, and you're not looking for that.

If you like the ride buy a Buick or Caddilac, they isolate you like a comfy sofa. The styling of the Lexus leaves me shivering, bland, bland, bland. Now I must admit that it is very well put together. My mother-in-law has had her SC400 for 7 yrs and 100k miles, never ever had any type of problem with the car or the dealership. I'm sure a new SC430 will replace it shortly. Personally though the car strikes me as soulless. I tried talking my wife into an S500 over the BMW for a little better reliability and service. After driving all three we own a 750iL. It is far and away the most fun to drive, the S500 is no slouch, but the BMW was clearly better. I guess I also have trouble comparing cars to investments. Cars are far too disposable to be considered this way. Besides not one of the cars up for discussion will become any type of appreciating classic. Thankfully there is competition, this gives us different flavors to choose from. Maybe I am just still too young to appreciate the serenity of the Lexus driving experience. I tried to like it, it is the most reliable, and has the best service support system extant. But lets face it, the car is a dud. The Germans still build some soul into their cars.

554,"February 13, 2001 6:40PM",ljflx,"When a company with Toyota's financial muscle targets your space you pay strict attention. When its new car is as well received as the original LS400 was you call in the generals and reserve the biggest board room in the building and meet very often and re-define your strategy for a long-term war. And you copy some of the things that make them sucessful. As the company gets stronger as Lexus did you make moves like MB did when it was forced to drop prices as it did with the S-Class a few years ago. You don't think Lexus had something to do with that? Do you think MB was being charitable? Stop living in fantasyland about these cars.

This is business - not bragging rights. It's very obvious that cars improve over time but MB had to do more than it would have if Lexus wasn't there plus it had to drop prices. It will have to answer the raised bar that the LS430 put up pretty soon or it will lose its leadership. As for Lexus it's pretty obvious what its next chess move will be. An LS500 with better handling - probably right at the level of MB - and of course a better ride still and probably even quieter if that's possible. They'll be a V-12 LS600 option as well of course. And given MB's problematic acquisition of Chrysler, turmoil at the top of the company, and success of the LS430 that move will now happen at an earlier time than was planned a year ago. And you know what its better for both you and I because the competitive level keeps increasing. As I said its business."
555,"February 13, 2001 7:08PM",arcoates,"I don't dispute that the LS400 had a huge impact on the industry. But only in the area that it was an alternative to the traditional luxury cars from America and Europe. The only revolutionary thing it did was to be able to be priced thousands less than the originals.

Therefore, it forced, like you said, the originals to drop their prices to be competitive. So in turn, it made the super luxury car more affordable for you and I.

But I dispute that MB would've had to cut prices sooner or later even if the LS didn't come along. Look at Bentley and Rolls-Royce- they haven't had to cut prices at all, and they are still successful. Granted, they only cater to a very small percent of the population, but those few could go to cars like BMW and Mercedes, but they still go to Bentley and Rolls.

People credit Lexus for being a revolutionary company, when all along the originals were making huge advances in the auto world which would eventually be passed down to the lesser models.

Do you think that if the Japanese cars had never come along, that we would be living in the dark ages with no remote keyless entry and navigation systems? No, we would be in the same place. It was the MB S500 that pioneered the active cruise control, and Cadillac Deville the night vision. Some may see it as stupid, but it will be adopted by other manufacturers.

Lexus does not deserve a medal for coming to the market. It deserves no credit except as a poor mans S-class.

You've got to be kidding if you think Lexus was after the American companies. It didn't need a premium brand for that. Make no mistake that it's going after MB's spot. It made that very clear with its original v-8 which forced both MB and BMW to make more cars with that size engine. This is only round 2 and Lexus is gaining fast.

I agree Lexus did force all luxury car makers to re-examine the way the price and sell cars. But design wise Lexus didn't do squat. No amount of copying and price cuts from Toyota's thought up brand could ever undue the accoplishments of Mercedes-Benz. I seriously doubt there will ever be a LS600, an LS500 I can see them doing. And it still won't be up to the level of the S600 or the current 750iL, not to mention the next generation 7-Series. Mercedes-Benz did not aquire Chrysler, so Chrylser's current position has very little to do with Mercedes' cars. The parent company bought Chrysler, not Mercedes-Benz itself.

I would pick an Audi, BMW, MB over a Lexus anyday for their superior driving dynamics.

Even if I were driven by someone sitting at the back, I rather pick a long wheel base limo over a Lexus, the latter's suspension is so soft it makes me car sick. With a limo, at least I get more room.

Don't believe everything you hear - Lexus are not that reliable, their leather seats wear off prematurely for example.

The LS' drive is so isloated it's dangerous giving the driver zero feedback. Sure the car is quiet but that's about the only virtue really.

I like the GS430's drive but it's lack of room is pathetic, I think a 3 series has more room than the GS."
563,"February 14, 2001 6:41AM",bwh,"To say that Lexus forced MB to change the S class is a bit far fetched. So the original LS400 introduced in '90 caused MB to alter the W140 S class?? That is simply incorrect. The W140 was basically written in stone design wise when the LS was introduced. The S offered 4,5,and 6 liter engines. I did not see big price drops during the cars '92-'99 production. The S500 stayed near $100k and the S600 at $140k, all along offering more features than Lexus imagined. I agree on the LS500,LS600 it will never happen. Even if it does I don't think they will offer a legitimate performance alternative to either the top BMW or MB. I would see a move like that as more catch-up by Lexus. I do think they are fine machines, I do think they are very well put together. I also know that MB uses superior materials in their cars. The paint and leather in my MB far exceeds that of even my wifes 750. I would take either in the long run over the Lexus. My opinion is that the current S-class leads the pack, the new 7 series will be a close second (the 750 is awesome but an S600..ooohh baby!) and Lexus will continue to play catch-up. Since when have they been the innovators in this class. The Japanese are suberb copy-cats, and that to me is the sincerest form of flattery towards BMW and MB."

I bought the Mercedes because I LIKE it better. It's impossible to exactly define if it's the ride, handling, styling, engineering features,,etc. that makes a difference. It's really a combination of many factors (although riding in an ugly luxury car might be embarassing).

Design is always subjective, I think the second generation LS 400 is more classic which will age better than the current one.

As for some of the snobs on this site who say that Lexus is lagging that's pure frustration and envy since they know Lexus makes a fine product but it doesn't come from Germany.

Don't ever second guess what Toyota will or won't do. They have Bill Gates deep pockets and talented engineers and can easily elevate the LS model to an even more lofty status than the current one. I foresee an LS500 model in the next few years just give it time. Perfection doesn't come over night. Performance additions as in 400+ hp to the GS series are in the works as we speak so don't think Lexus is sitting idle and watching its competitors cruise by.

I get a kick out of listening to these Euro lovers defend their cars, but when I ask why Mercedes has all these realibility and quality problems lately they can't answer me or they say ""yeah but it has heritage and a soul"". When Joe Blow's Benz is in the shop for the 15th time in a year I'm pretty sure he's thinking yeah but it's ok it's got a soul. Bringing up Bill Gates, yes he loves his LS 400 and SC400 coupe has stated they are among his favorite cars. Not bad advertising I""ll say."

So don't give me this bull that Lexus wasn't thinking about the American cars. The Deville DTS is a better car in my opinon that the LS430.

WBWYNN- You must own cars for their curb appeal. If you are a person who actually cares about driving dynamics, you would have never purchased an LS430 because it simply cannot compete with the euros. You say that euro heritage is silly- the only reason the euros come out on top is because of their heritage- they have worked for years on perfecting their cars. Lexus came along, took the best of what MB had, and then tried to copy it. Congrats on buying your Lexus, but you could've got the same performance in a DTS for less money!

PRATTSTER- I think you must be mistaken, because Mercedes have the reputation of being rock solid, which will last for years. I don't know a single person who owns an MB who has had to take their car in for signifigant service. And no, they are not C-Class owners, but E55 and S-Class owners. So don't critisize MB for being engineered poorly, when Lexus is just copying them. They must be doing something right!

570,"February 14, 2001 2:28PM",flint350,"Good Lord, what logic and plain misunderstanding and/or misrepresentation of fact!! That Cadillac ""was once"" the ""standard"" has nothing to do with Lexus' obvious competitor the Benz S. No knowledgable objective car mag/enthusiast/writer I have seen or read has ever said the DeVille is of such high quality. It is always praised as being better than Cadillac has been recently. Even Motor Trend (no fans of Lexus there) said in their comparo that the DTS simply didn't belong in the same contest with the Lexus/Benz/BMW.

Saying Lexus simply can't compete with the Euros is futher evidence of very limited personal opinion being stated as fact. The vast majority of the automotive press disagree. Whether one or the other is slightly better, etc. is open to debate, but to say it ""simply can't compete"" borders on lunacy. Good grief, the very article quoted before this post clearly says, not only can the Lexus compete, but in their INFORMED and EXPERIENCED opinion, it is often equal or BETTER.

You go on to say a DTS is the same for less money and therefore a better choice!!! This is downright foolishness - yet you refute your own logic by refusing to admit that the Lexus (who all agree is AT LEAST a real competitor of the Benz) is less expensive than the Benz with the same features,etc - making it a better value!

As for MB's reputation for ""rock solid"" and never in for signif. service!!! Do you actually read what people (actual owners-not phony zealots) on this and the S Class board write about their various S Class experiences? Are they just phony liars trying to destroy the reputation of the S??
Get real. You are entitled to your opinion, whether it is fact or fantasy based. But at least try to stick reasonably close to facts when you level criticism. The S Class is a very good car. The Lexus is a very good car. The BMW is a very good car. We all want to satisfy our personal needs in our choices. In choosing my LS430, I partly decided on reliability, quiet, interior and value. I would have spent the extra money on the S if it bought me something more - in my opinion, it didn't. I would have gotten less of what I wanted and paid $20K for the privilege."
571,"February 14, 2001 3:52PM",bwh,"That was a sensible post. I agree on the DTS, wrong league. You chose the LS430 for the reasons important to YOU. I agree, I think they are ALL superb machines. My priorities are different. The features that are important to me relate to the road feel and handling of the car. The BMW is where smart money goes for a sporty attitude and a few compromises to achieve it. I still prefer the S class to the Lexus, I think its ride and handling combo is a good compromise between the isolation of the Lexus and the sporting flavor of the BMW. For MY tatse the Lexus looks and drives too bland for me. The ride and the luxo features were simply not important. I don't even own the navigation CD for my home area, never used the nav system at all. Just an example of priorities when buying cars in the same class."
572,"February 14, 2001 5:06PM",arcoates,"Did I ever say that the DTS is categorized in the same field as the rest? No, so don't you dare go off on a tantrum. I said that I think the DTS has about as much driving excitement as the Lexus. And I would rather spend my money on that if I was going to buy a luxo-cruiser, which is simply what the LS is.

On the fact that the automotive world says that the Lexus is at or beyond the rest, that is pure crap. Edmunds own review said that for a Lexus, it is exremely sporty, but it still cannot compare with the Mercedes and BMW for driving excitement. And that is my focus- the Lexus is not a drivers car like the others. I ask you to find me a piece of writing by someone who has half a brain that says the Lexus will be more fun to drive than a BMW. Ha!

I would rather spend the extra $10,000 to get some excitement out of my vehicle. In my eyes, it is not a better value because it puts the driver in complete isolation from the world. Yes, it is extremely quiet, like a vault, but I would like to hear what BMW has done with my V12 under hard acceleration.

I do not dispute that the Lexus has all the bells and whistles that the rest have- hell that's what the Japanese are known for. I am simply stating that in the styling and engineering, they have copied the rest yet again, mostly Mercedes.

As for your comment about being informed- I am a true car enthusiast who will read respectable publications such as R&T, Automobile, CAR and a battery of others. You americans think that Motor Trend and Car and Driver count for a lot. The rest of the world thinks that most of the american publications are so yankee biased, and only care about SUV's and big american V8's.

Whatever choice someone wants to make, is their own business. This message board is for discussion, and that is purely what I am doing. I want to seek the opinions of others, and maybe dispute them. I am not mounting personal attacks on anyone, as you are FLINT350.

Merc1 - Of course Daimler took over Chrysler. But in acquisitions the actual owner is set up for legal and tax purposes. Do you think they are going to look for synergies and operationally consolidate Chrysler anywhere but in the auto group? Heavy equipment division - maybe? - comeon now. In my company some of the CEO's would fall off their chairs if they knew who legally owned their companies or divisions.

As for the next Lexus LS modification you can bet your house on a LS500. In an article somewhere - not Edmunds - it mentioned that Lexus was toying with a V-12 for this model year but dropped it at the eleventh hour - so that's inevitabe too and it may come sooner than anyone thinks. They'll never make the equivalent of an S-55 or an AMG but not for the reasons you'd like to think. No one makes meaningful money on limited production/special edition/custom products in any business. They are usually loss leaders and CFO's cut them out the moment business goes south.

One last thing - Toyota's market cap is $128BLN vs. $51bln for Daimler. It also has $12bln. more cash and $20bln less debt. I wouldn't doubt its wherewithall and I'm sure MB is smarter than you about them. They are the 800lb gorilla here."

I am very passionate about cars, and enjoy a heated discussion. I am pro-euro- no doubt about it. But I have not ""lost it"". I haven't called anyone stupid for buying something Japanese, or that they are complete hunks of crap. I have said everything but!

And you are quite mistaken about being ""in way over my head"". There is a collection of people, includig merc1 by the sounds of it that agree that the german cars are best in class. I think that most of the professional automotive community would agree- that is what I have based my opinions on- by reading about the different choices and making the tough decision of what is best!

I am sorry if I have offended anyone. It is not my intention. In my effort to create heated discussion, it may have come out that I want to condemn those who favour the japanese cars.

577,"February 15, 2001 1:29AM",merc1,"I agree that Lexus will do a LS500. I would too if I were them. Agreed. I agree with you on the DCX merger, but it will never work as far as Mercedes cars are concerned. They say the the 2 will never share platforms. I hope they don't. Ever. It's not about ownership of the company, I'm just saying the because Chrysler can't move enough 300M's doesn't mean Mercedes is going to be affected right away. Let me wrap the Lexus vs. Mercedes and other Euros like this. Lexus will always be the affordable car, the bargain. Mercedes and BMW will almost never be able to compete price for price with the Japanese. However for the true enthusiast BMW and Mercedes are the ""better"" cars. Performance, styling and design all go to the Germans. The more practical car is going to always be Japanese, but for anything over 30K I want some excitement and stimulation that only a European car can provide, and for me personally I can put up with a little less reliability in turn for more fun. It's cars like the S55 that make the case for the Euro brands. Nothing from Japan or America can substitue/compare. And Mercedes won't build a car that they are going to loose money on. They'll hike the price and sell less, they done it before, but never loose money on their core models (C,E,S, SL, CL,M). The A-Class might be a loosing sell but the cars we get here turn a profit, you can believe that.

It's not like the S-Class is junk or even remotely close to it. Believe it or not but their are S-Class owners that haven't had any problems, like there are probably some LS430 owners that didn't get a flawless car either. I believe Automobile did a long-term test of the S500 and their car didn't have a single malfunction. For me and quite a few others the Lexus dealership experience, customer service and coffin-like silence of their cars isn't enough to warrant driving such a blah, ho-hum car.

M"
578,"February 15, 2001 5:48AM",ljflx,"Good way to end it. But tell me something. Why is MB making the C Class look so much, at least frontally where it is an exact match, like the S-Class? Big tactical mistake in my opinion. For its price the S has to be unique. If I just shelled out $80k plus for an S-500 (or $110k plus for a 600) I don't want to see a $32k or so C in my rearview mirror right after I drive out of the showroom or on the dealers lot for that matter. This is one of the reasons why I walked away from the S. The other is that I felt exactly the same way as Flint 350 wrote in his post. As well the real money for these cars is in the 45+ age bracket. With the bull market dying the younger crowd, who the S is now aimed at, may not have the financial ability to buy the S. The ""easy money"" days unfortunately are over. This is another reason why Lexus may make a big move at MB soon.

Personally I think the most beautiful MB is the E-Class. And maybe thats why I bought the LS430. The E is now MB's most Lexus like look. But it's far too small - the same size as a Camry at 189 inches long. If I'm MB I lenghthen that to 197 inches and make it my Lexus fighter. But the E is their bread and butter car so they may not have the gumption for that. I hope they don't change that to look like the S. Betting the ranch on one design would be very foolish.

But never say never about Toyota. I'm sure in the 1980's people would have said Toyota could never have built a Lexus. In 1990 they were probably saying Lexus would never survive. Could'nt have been more wrong. Ten years from now these two companies will still be duking it out but there is now a big difference than ten years ago. MB does not have much,if any, margin for error.

With that I'm through with this. Have a great day."

580,"February 15, 2001 6:47AM",bwh,"Sometimes I guess. I have always felt that Lexus has had a place in this group. Ten years ago when the original LS400 was introduced Car and Driver put it up against the 560SEL, 750iL, and a Bently Turbo R. The only major failing cited was that it was considerably smaller inside than the BMW and Merc. It fared quite well, and continues to do so. I agree with Merc1 about MB reliability. While the cars have changed, some say cheapened, I still find them extremely impressive. The S55 is agressive looking, fast and offers the best compromise between ride and handling on the planet. I personally found the cockpit of the 750 to be more driver oriented and the V12 for the price of a V8 MB made the sale. While in the same catagory, I really don't see any sporting intentions from the LS430. Now this strikes me as how MB used to be, silently competant, capable when pushed but not eager to do so. With its latest offerings MB has offered wonderful sport and AMG variants. These approach BMW for driving excitement (some say match, some say exceed), I think that is a great image builder for MB. While I wouldn't quite go so far as to say Lexus couldn't get in there, I firmly believe they will never top the heap for sporting nature in any of their lines. The IS300 and GS400 are awesome machines, but I think they also reflect Lexus' conservative side. They have yet to go all the way and offer manual transmissions like BMW. I think Merc1 had it right, Lexus will always be competative and the value leader. I think the premium charged by MB and BMW DOES buy you something tangible. Not heritage or status but a driving feel gleaned from years of experience designing autobahn ready cars. So if you want a dead reliable luxury car loaded with features and racing around is not on your agenda, the Lexus is a GREAT car. Personally I enjoy running my 750 HARD on occasion. It is practically impossible to drive this car slow, it is born to run. Not something said about the LS430. Unless you are considering the S55 I think the S430 and S500 fall in the middle. I was very impressed by the air suspension, it corners flat, maybe flatter than the BMW and has a great ride. I feel dang lucky to be able to legitimately shop these cars. They are all awesome, not a lemon in the bunch, just diffrent flavors.

Now to be a little less sensible and maybe a little antogonistic (all in fun). I can't stand the look of the Lexus. I know the Japanese have trouble being original with styling (at least original in a timeless sense) but the copy catting must be insulting to its buyers. I respect Toyota very much, but they will never surpass the Germans for top of the line luxo cars. Actually in my opinion they have fallen just short in every market vs. the Germans. They seem to stop shy of greatness and fall back on sterling reliability and service to close the gap. I call that CHICKEN! Leaders take risks, followers do just that, follow.

P.S. ljflx, don't give up, your comments are needed for balance. There are plenty of folks like you for which the Lexus is perfect."

582,"February 15, 2001 7:04AM",denniswade,"I think the thing that people here take offense to is not your opinions, but the way you express them. When you call something ""crap"" and disparage the intelligence of those who may disagree with you, you lower the level of this debate to a mud-slinging contest. That does neither you nor your opinions any favors, because people feel they have to contest them out of self-respect, if nothing else. We're here to discuss and disagree, but not to attack each other.

By the way -- since our host informs me that I cannot quote directly from AutoWorld, I have paraphrased my previous post below:

The AutoWorld article I told you about lists the 740iL first because of its styling and driving dynamics -- it's simply the most fun.

However, the Lexus LS430 was only half a point behind. The Lexus' fit and finish, ergonomics and comfort are superb, and it is actually a little faster than the BMW. it is also a heck of a value. It just doesn't have the entertainment and fun of the BMW.

The Mercedes was rated a strong third, but the high price, ergonomics, fit and finish, and lack of performance made it noncompetitive with the BMW and the Lexus.

The Jaguar was last in almost every category; however, its heritage and style are still magical, and the price is very attractive.

My observations: the Lexus narrowly beat out the BMW for acceleration honors (the Bimmer was a 740il with the V8), and far outclassed the Mercedes (6.4/14.5 vs 7.1/15.0). I've also driven all three (the Bimmer, Merc and Lex) back to back, and while I loved the Bimmer, I still don't care for the Mercedes handling dynamics. The article added that the Lexus interior ""sets the standard,"" and that its fit-and-finish is ""the benchmark of the industry."" The article went on to criticize the Merc for its sloppy transmission (""gear changes don't come quickly enough and aren't as smooth as the BMW and Lexus"") and its ergonomics and materials (""In a car costing nearly $80,000, the plastics in the Benz are disappointing."") Oh yeah --the Lexus was the least expensive too, by a long shot -- it was $61, the Jag $65, the BMW $71 and the Merc $78. So I would hardly call this comparison test a victory for Mercedes.

As a final point, I would like to share my obsservation that when people get angry and abusive, it's usually because they're unsure of their ground. (This last point has been amplified by some of the posts that followed this one!)

Now back to the games..."
583,"February 15, 2001 9:16AM",flint350,"If, in my post, I seemed to ""personally attack"" you, I apologize. I did not intend to - only to refute what I saw as blatant errors or misstatements.

As for ""you Americans"", I didn't know your background and never impugned it in any way. In fact, I made no assumptions about it. Those kind of comments have no place here except in how they can reflect our differing opinions based on potentially different cultures - not on the validity of our opinions. Lastly, I agree with denniswade, in that it is your presentation that causes concern, not your opinion. I don't mind disagreement, but I do mind yelling and lecturing.

As for my comment regarding ""amercians"". I took your previous comment about me being ignorant t heart, as I view myself as an informed individual. In turn, my comments were not meant as a racial slurr in any way, just that I have been schooled in the european way of thinking- that the emphasis be on driving dynamics and not on large engines and flashy chrome. So my comments stem from people quoting Motor Trend and Car and Driver, when in my opinion they do favour the big V8, and other non-relevant details. I'm sorry if it came off sounding anything but.

585,"February 15, 2001 1:15PM",arcoates,"On a different note- and I will try to put this as delicately as possible:

590,"February 15, 2001 9:37PM",ljflx,"Glad you've gotten it back. I would'nt be surprised if that next move by Lexus includes the enthusiasts car but I wouldn't be surprised if they bypassed it either. They've made a conservative move toward that with the euro suspension. This company is making some of the best business moves I've ever seen in the super luxury class though. I know it irks you that they copied MB in 1990 but if it was out of respect that was only a small part of the reason. The real purpose was to destroy the MB's uniqueness at a fraction of the price. How do you take on the market leader - copy him, differentiate slightly and build in qualities that make his weaknesses standout (note Lexus' realibility) and lastly price it a lot lower so his would be customers come to you. Pure business strategy but to an enthusiasts that makes him a copycat. That strategy was quite successful. In 1990 the LS400 sold for about 40% the price of an S-500 but today a comparably equipped LS430 sells for 80% of the S-500. Lexus price went up while MB's price dropped. All evidence of a well executed strategy.

What comes next - copy the engine sizes but differentiate elsewhere. They've got the customer base to be bold now and as much as they are conservative in styling they are quite bold in business. Do you have any idea how much was at stake in their investment to build the Lexus brand? Do you realize how little it would mean to their bottom line to hire a team of Italian designers for the next model. They'd make $7.52bln instead of $7.53bln. - big deal. Don't underestimate this company or how easy it is to build in a bold new style for one model. That's where I'd bet they will go.

I'm afraid that what Lexus accomplished in 1990 signalled the end of the stand-alone super luxury car brand. Once it started to pass its technology to the everyday Toyotas after a 2-3 year exclusive for Lexus it meant it had a huge edge over MB,BMW and Jag. It had a car base to leverage that technology - they didn't. Thats why Jag went to Ford and MB got Chrysler though that latter deal should have been the other way around. Of course Toyota has Lexus and Nissan has Infiniti. The two oddballs left are GM and BMW. BMW is private so they don't have to put up with public market pressures but they won't survive long-term if they don't move at some point. GM's got to have a luxury brand so that looks like a marriage to me. It's got to happen. BMW's cars may be impressive but it's financials are not. Company has shown no revenue growth in past three years and its profit margins are weakening. Look at its margins compared to Toyota.

By the way Nissan is now run by a German and that new Q coming in April has a 340 engine and is aimed right at BMW at a much lower price. It may have taken a German now based in Japan to get them finally going and that guy is going to cause a lot of Germans in Germany to lose a lot of sleep. That new Z looks pretty awesome to.

Bottom line in all this is simple. The playing field has been levelled and the landscape has been permantly changed all because of the copying of a great car by a great company. End of story."
591,"February 16, 2001 6:44AM",bwh,"none of that adresses the simple fact that the Japanese have yet to be able to copy the ""driving feel"" provided by the Germans, albiet for a premium. I think that is my beef with Lexus, I think this is what some of us (arcroates, merc1, myself) are trying to impress upon the Lexus fans. Now it appears that this is simply not important to some buyers. If that is the case the Lexus is the perfect car for such buyers. Toyota/Lexus is undeniably an impressive automotive presence with very deep pockets. Until they figure out how to put some real style in their designs and build some great driving dynamics into their cars, those of us who buy cars primarily for those reasons will continue to shop BMW and Mercedes-Benz."
592,"February 16, 2001 7:26AM",blehrlich,"The BMWs and Mercedes have a certain ""feel"" that is recognizable even if you were blindfolded. If blindfolded in a Lexus, one would not be able to differentiate between the Lexus, a Cadillac DeVille or a Lincoln Town Car (not that there's anything wrong with that). That's not necessarily a bad thing, it just depends what you are looking for (but I still can't get over the ugly exterior of the LS430)."
593,"February 16, 2001 1:26PM",arcoates,"This is what I am trying to say- lexus still isn't a drivers car. They have done a great job of producing many things, but driving excitement isn't one of them. I guess my point wasn't getting across because I was too blatant.

Anyway- I do agree that nowadays, the luxury marques have to have some big car company muscle behind them to stay alive. Jaguar was floundering when Ford snapped them up. Mercedes-Benz was okay, because they bought Chrysler. BMW is going to have to do it sooner or later, and I hope it is GM, but I doubt it, and this is why:

You may not want to hear this, but when the STS moves to the sigma RWD platform in a couple of years, it will be competition for the cars we talk about here. It has most everything it needs to play in this league, except (a)RWD and (b) a quality problem.

It's getting RWD, so all GM has to do is step up it's quality control. The interiors are designed beautifully, it's just that they sometimes use low-rent materials, and they have the tendency to fall apart.

If they can get those two things right, I think they will be a major player. Can anyone deny that the Northstar isn't a gem? If they increase displacement, they could easily get 350hp, and be right in with these guys. Exterior styling is nice, better than the LS I think, some pretty high-tech gadgets, advanced chassis. I think it will become a major player in this market.~ A.R."

598,"February 16, 2001 10:03PM",ejerod,"I've been away for awhile and wow I missed all the fireworks. As I've said in previous posts I own both a Lexus and a Mercedes . They are of two different classes. The Lex is a 99 GS 300, the Benz a 2001 S 500 /AMG sports package. I first bought the Lexus because of it's unique styling, value and Lexus reputation for reliability. Here's the report:
Two weeks after I bought the GS-service engine light comes on. It seems Lexus had a problem with the supplier of the chip that regulated this. The chips were defective. Result recall on the chips. Some people had the problem some didn't. It affected GS and LS models according to the dealer. It took 3 weeks for the chip to get in.

One month after owning the GS, the glove box was rattling had to be replaced.

About the same time the sunshade rattled, had to be tightened.

2 months ago, GS radio had to be replaced due to malfunctions.

Now the Benz. COMAND system had to be replaced due to software issues.

My point is this. No matter what the manufacturer's marketing departments trumpet and what J. D. Powers and all the other pundits proclaim, the fact is these cars are wonderful machines but they are fallible no matter who manufactures them. That being said, do I regret my buying decisions ? Not at all. Like I said I own both and seriously considered buying the LS430 because I am so pleased with the GS300. But in the world of ultra luxury MB wins the big luxo car battle. Did I pay more ? of course.. do I regret it ? Absolutely not. Now please don't go quoting the so called Auto mags. For every article one can produce of the Lexus or BMW or Jag being the better car there are at lease 2 others that state the opposite. It's all subjective . Bottom line ? Buy what you choose for whatever reason. It's funny that no one says to the Bently owner "" for 300k you could have had 4.5 LS430's or 3 S600's "" Do you really think the Bently owner cares ? And yes I drove the Bently too and considered a 2000 Bently Arnage that was slightly less than 200k. So it is with the MB owners. Yes we could have saved 15-30k, but we really, really,don't care.... at least I don't.. so enjoy what you drive and let's all join hands and sing Cumbaya...lol"
599,"February 17, 2001 6:43AM",arcoates,"I think I am right on this one. The DTS will stay FWD, because if they move it to RWD, it is too much competition for each other.

GM doesn't have a car to play in that market, and I don't think they are willing to spend a ton of money to get BMW. They would much rather just improve and existing model. The DTS is the flagship true- but their client base for that one is old men. Yes, the average age is lowering, but it is still a retirement complex car.

605,"February 18, 2001 5:34AM",merc1,"Thank you. Well as far as the C looking like the S, it's always been that way. The previous C from 1994-2000 looked just like the S-Class from 1992-1999 (the infamous W140-Tanks) the 190E looked like the 420/560SEL's of the day. The previous C, especially at night was almost impossible to tell from the 1999 S-Class if the car was coming from behind you. Now granted the new C is an exact copy of the S, but it's just keeping it in the family. The E has always been the style leader, now I expect the next E (2003) to break away from the S and C look with something different. Actually there is spy/enhanced photo of the 2003 E in the E-Class topic. It looks similar to the S of course, but it's not exactly like it. I still way let Lexus make their ""big move"", Mercedes will always be Mercedes-Benz. They've been around too long to be toppled that easy, or at least not to see it coming. Believe it or not I really thought Lexus would make it, especially I saw the first dealership (Chicago area) around here. Then I looked at their main car (LS400) and who it was imitating. I thought here's a Japanese Benz, and that's basically what they are.

Naturally I like all Mercedes cars, but the E has always been the ""best"" one for me. It's the right size and price and it gives a good dose of the Benz experience. My favorite E were the 1986-1995 W124 models. I don't know if you remember those, but they defined what a ""Mercedes-Benz"" is. Pure.

Funny thing about all this is that in 5-7 years Hyundai will probably have a 45K car, and/or a luxury division.

HP is going to have to mean a lot, because to me this is sorry, pitiful car, I would rather have (gulp!) the LS430. Japanese have no design talent at all. If that is what the new Z is going to look like they can keep it. The previous car was good looking, but this new one isn't. Mercedes' parent company didn't buy Chrysler because of Lexus, I know you don't think that. If that was the case, Daimler-Benz would have done something in 1993, when they were at their lowest point of the previous decade. I guess what I keep hearing from you is that Toyota/Lexus changed the world so much and it just isn't so. GM will never have BMW. Never. Ever. What technology did Lexus have 2-3 years before Mercedes. I would really like to know that.

607,"February 18, 2001 5:56AM",merc1,"Cadillac has a chance of truly competing, but they are chasing a moving target that is already way ahead of them. GM's problem is that they don't sweat the details of luxury car construction like Mercedes, BMW and yes Lexus. Lexus is the just more of the same nightmare for GM. The Camry handles one end and the LS430 the other. The Europeans have the luxury car know-how to compete better with the Japanese. Cadillac's Northstar is one good engine, and a rwd will complement it, but if Cadillac doesn't do something more with the way they build their cars, the advantages of the engine/chassis combo will be lost. Mercedes, BMW and Lexus cars don't fall apart after 50K miles, like so many GM cars do. I'm so anxious to see what the 2004 Seville will be like, but by then a new E, GS, and 5-Series will be right there waiting. Then there is Audi, Jaguar, Infiniti and I think everyone is going to be surprised when Acura decides to seriously compete in the upper segments. I know they have the RL, but it get trounced by almost all of it's 6-cylinder competition.

609,"February 18, 2001 11:21AM",ljflx,I didn't say Lexus had technology before MB. Only that it had a huge car base to pass it onto. In the business world that kind of leverage is a huge advantage. Their strategy could have backfired but it didn't. That's why MB had no choice. But Juergen has made colossal bad moves since the deal. You don't buy a company and then turn off their management team the way he did. Foolish German pride.
610,"February 18, 2001 3:40PM",arcoates,"I agree merc1- that is the only problem with GM. I think it's because they have always been the worlds largest company, and sell their cars regardless of the interior pieces. It's almost as if they have the same workmanship standards from the Cavalier to the STS. If they want to compete, they are gonna have to wise up.

Acura better have something good with the new RL- because at the moment it is no competition to the rest. And the new Q is extremely ungainly in design- the front headlights, although revolutionary (they claim) are so huge they make the car look funny. The rest of it is so conservative, that I agree I would take the LS430 over it.

The next few years should be interesting in this market- with all the new money around, more car companys are going to try and join this market, and there is going to be some extremely good cars out there~ A.R."

616,"February 19, 2001 9:06AM",ljflx,"What I meant was that once Lexus developed a new technology it kept it for itself - usually 2-3 years than passed it onto Toyota to use in their broad base of cars. The capitalized development cost of the technology asset could be spread over a longer period of time (improved income statement) and Toyota saved cash on development for the everyday cars. The new dvd based nav system for example is already in the Landcruiser and will work its way down the Toyota line in a few years. Don't be surprised if an Avalon is getting it at the same time as MB is upgrading to DVD. Toyotas already have dashboard cd players, MB's are still in the trunk. These are just a couple of the evident ones - there are so many engineering based ones as well like traction control etc. MB couldn't keep their prices competitive if they didn't have a platform to spread their technology to. BMW is in that position right now. Technology license deals will not solve the problem. BMW's fine for the next few years but beyond that they are in trouble. Their profit margins are way lower than Toyota already.

I know these brands are revered here but in truth if they don't make the right business moves they won't be able to engineer the cars we are used to in the future. Let's face it they don't have the luxury of raising prices the way they did in the pre-1990 era."

So an owner of a shoddy 1990 VDP who trades into a nice new V8 VDP will be astonished by the improvement in quality. This will be reflected in the survey, lets just say they were a little jaded from previous experience. Now if a Lexus owner has any trouble, even the smallest item, it is likely to be reflected in the survey.

624,"February 21, 2001 1:06AM",merc1,"Oh you mean within the Toyota empire, Lexus kept the technology for themselves. Yes that's true, luxury brand first. I'll be the first on to admit that Mercedes and all other German cars (Porsche is a disgrace) are way behind on in-car entertainment. Mercedes still doesn't offer an in-dash CD player standard, which quite frankly is silly and absurd for a 2001 model car. Remember I'm probably their 2nd biggest fan on all of Edmunds. Are you saying that Lexus has traction control first? I think it went like this, Lexus was first in the U.S. on the 1990 LS400, but the 500SL (also new for 1990) had it also, but in Europe only, it came to the U.S. on the 500SL for 1991. Cadillac *may have* had it in 1989 on the Allante. Not sure, but possible. You can't expect BMW's profit margins to be as high as Toyota's, look at the size of the 2 companies. As long as BMW does what they do best, build the best sporting luxury cars on earth they'll be ok, if not bursting at the seams with cash like you say Toyota is. You have to remember that Germans are very stubborn, they rarely if ever sell cars at a loss. And Mercedes' prices are only competitive at base, with options Mercedes' cars are still ususually thousands more than their nearest competitor, excluding BMW. Yes they have more standard equipment now, and they are cheaper than their direcet predessors, but they'll never cost less than a Japanese car. So far there hasn't been any technology from MB implemented on any Chrysler products, if that is what you meant by MB having another ""platform"" to spread costs too. Otherwise they've always spreaded techlogoy from the bigger cars to the smaller ones.

M"
625,"February 21, 2001 7:39AM",bwh,Never intended to entertain you with anything other than race car moves. I never even listen to the CD player in my Porsche when its on the track where it belongs.
626,"February 21, 2001 1:11PM",arcoates,"Personally, I would opt for the XJ6. There wasn't a huge improvement switching from the I6 to the V8. To compare, the I6 had 245 bhp, and 289 ft.lb. of torque. The V8 has 290 bhp, and 290 ft.lb. of torque. So, in day to day driving, where torque is more important, they are equal.

The body styles are nearly identical, the XJ6's will be cheaper, interiors almost the same (I prefer the XJ6 interior design to the XJ8 actually). The XJ8's will come with more standard equipment, but any Jag buyer would load it to the gills anyway.

We got our XJ6 used, as you will, and it had the ""Select Jaguar Warranty"" I think it's called. It's whatever Jaguar gives to it's used cars, that's the name. And it pretty much covers everything.

I would say go for a 1996-97 XJ6. It's always better not to buy the first year of a car. I would also say to go for the Vanden Plas, as the rear-seat room in the standard wheelbase is pitiful.

As for the reliability problems, Ford had owned Jaguar for a number of years when these models came out, and they worked out most of the bugs.

They are great cars to buy used. The mileage isn't really an issue, since the engines are engineered to high standards. I'd say somewhere in the 60,000m range.

I think you will be happy with either an XJ6 or an XJ8, but I would advise to go for the XJ6. Better fuel economy, and not much of a difference from the V8. Good luck.~ A.R>"
627,"February 21, 2001 3:35PM",denniswade,"You diss Lexus for their emphasis on ride and tranquillity and recommend the Jag? Come one now. The Jaguar has far less of the driving dynamic you say you love in the German makes. It's a soft, luxurious car in the British tradition -- and it's showing its age. Check out the latest comparison test in Auto World Weekly -- the Jag came out on the bottom for a whole host of reasons, including lack of power.

As for bwh's comment that ""The companies financial statement means nothing to me. Buying a Lexus based on their bottom line seems beside the point, the car is not an investment,"" I believe he missed the point. What ljflx was saying is that by following a sound business plan, Lexus will always have the necessary capital to meet the market head-on, whereas Mercedes is already in trouble because of its disastrous handling of the D/C merger and Mitsu buy-out. D/C's stock went up following the rumor (some say floated by D/C executive staff) that Toyota was thinking about buying them out. What does that tell you?"
628,"February 21, 2001 4:34PM",arcoates,"I am sorry, but I would take the Jaguar over the Lexus anyday because the Jaguar has a sense of heritage. That plays an important role in my decision making as well. And the Jaguar is not soft- it is not as stiff as the German cars, but when called upon it performs admirably. There is definately a difference between a BMW and Jaguar, but it is still a luxury-sport sedan. I would say the Lexus is a pure luxury car. Jaguar goes to the effort to tune their cars, and give them R designation. XJR, XKR etc...

And also, the lady of the house is the primary driver of the Jaguar and she primarily wanted it for it's curb appeal. She's a women- you can't blame her. If she had asked for a Lexus, the answer would definately be no. The Jaguar still ranks higher than the Lexus.~ A.R."
629,"February 21, 2001 6:50PM",ljflx,"Thanks. The moves of today will determine the cars (and prices)of tommorrow. Heritage is relevant in living things not cars. Both MB and BMW are in trouble right now. If MB mishandles Chrysler any further they will slide very fast. The car enthusiasts will notice the difference in quality in say 2004 or so. Toyota is in an unbelievably strong financial position and the fact that the LS430 is such a hit solidifies their market power all the more.

Merc1 - Regardless of who deploys new technology first the other guy usually is there within a year. So I hardly think it matters who gets there first. But if MB is not going to share platforms or technology then why the heck did it buy Chrysler? That deployment is what is making Toyota so solid right now. By the way the worst dream MB can have is to see luxury technology deployed in everyday Toyotas before they have it."

640,"February 22, 2001 7:25AM",shehzad,"I have a 1999 XJ8, and to be honest, I would disagree with the gentleman recommending the 6 cylinder over the 8 cylinder engine. First of all, b/c of the interior-I found the 6 cylinder interior to be kind of busy and difficult to follow, especially while driving, whereas the redesign in 1998 made the dash considerably more streamlined. Also, the recommended maintainence interval on the 8's is every 10,000 miles, and was 7500 miles on the xj6's. I usually keep my cars until they absolutely die, which is well past their warranty period, and as Jaguar's are expensive cars to service, one less trip to the service department for every 30,000 miles is easier on the wallet-especially after the warranty goes down. Next, in 1998, jag came out with side airbags, which I don't believe they had in the 6cylinders. I have no idea whether this should be a purchase consideration or not, as Jag's are pretty safe in the first place, but it's nice insurance. Finally, in comparing the XJ6, I can't really attest to their reliability, but I can say that I haven't had a single problem with my XJ8 and I average about 23mpg on mostly highway driving-and I'm pretty sure that the 6 cylinders isn't as good as mine, as one of the gentleman in my practice has a 1996 6 cylinder and was shocked with my fuel economy. If you can afford it, and I know there's a pretty big difference in price btween the 6's and 8's, I'd really go with the 8."
641,"February 22, 2001 7:50AM",bwh,"I know what you meant, just poking at you a bit. I agree, even the upgraded systems in the new Porsches are a joke. They apply technology to other priorities like power and handling, Germanic priorities, that is why I have one!

I also have test driven all of these cars and then some. Our first foray into luxo cars was a '95 740iL, not without its problems, but gorgeous to look at and splendid to drive. I looked at the LS400 (used) and the new LS430. I drove both, in the same weekend I drove the 740,750,S430,S500 and A8. I am impressed by the Lexus for quality, smoothness and service reputation. It's no secret that I prefer the M-B and BMW. The one that surprised me was the A8, very well equipped and the nicest interior of the bunch. The reputation of questionable quality kept me away, along with the prospect of repairing a damaged aluminum bodied car. I also would challenge the Lexus fans to take out the M-B and BMW for aggressive drives, this will reveal with no uncertainty the advantages of the German designs. The Lexus may be quiet, well equipped, and reliable, but it simply does not drive like a BMW. Like before I think it comes down to prorities, I like a responsive, virile machine, if I want to relax I use the couch in my living room. I also think it is foolish to suggest that M-B and BMW are in trouble financially and may not be able to compete. That is awfully far fetched, and certainly premature. Niether is floundering or lacking direction, they are the leaders, the innovaters, I have no doubt they will survive and flourish."

The car handles incredibly, without the slightly harsher ride of the 740iL sport (I have a bad back and am very sensitive to this). I have test driven an LS430 (with Eurotuned suspension and 17"" wheels and tires), and there is no comparison (especially with the MB's adjustable suspension). I still hink that the LS is unparalled when it comes to interior ""sumptuousness"", but I guess it depends on what you are looking for.
The only other area where Lexus blew it and is way behind is in the integration of a digital and voice activated telephone system (don't even try to defend the Lexus/Sprint telephone which Lexus is actually offering to buy back from customers.
Unfortunately, in all this talk of Lexus technical superiority, Lexus owners fail to give any credit where it is due."

However, they certainly have the financial means to do so -- they're the only ones who do -- and the information I included in my previous post came from the British newsletter I receive weekly; it's not something I made up just to irritate you (although it obviously does).

arcoates: On the off-chance that you may still be monitoring this topic, allow me to comment on one of your last posts. Re your comment that ""I am sorry, but I would take the Jaguar over the Lexus anyday because the Jaguar has a sense of heritage,"" I respect your love and respect for the marque -- all of us here feel that cars are much more than just sheetmetal and plastic -- but the intangible you describe is totally personal and non-quantifiable. It is also unfortunate that you take such a strong position on a car you've never driven, such as the LS430 (or any Lexus, for that matter). If handling is your preference, you might want to try the GS400 -- an awesome car with startling performance and handling. If you like a svelte sense of style with your performance, may I recommend the new SC430 -- it has the lovely combination of style, luxury and performance normally personified by Jaguar."
645,"February 22, 2001 5:48PM",ljflx,"I did not look at the BMW 740. Neither I nor my wife like its style and too many people we know had problems with their BMW's and told us to stay away from them. All of those people, like those on this board, raved about the engineering, but complained bitterly about the breakdowns.

We did however seriouly evaluate the A-8 quattro, the E-430 4matic - both because of the obvious all wheel drive - and the S430 and S500. We weren't all that impressed with the A-8 and the E-430 was just too small for us though looks wise this was our favorite.

We really wanted to move away from Lexus because we've had LS-400's in 1995 and again in 1998 - both of which were flawless - and wanted a change. We were very impressed with the S-500 but couln't stand the interior and found the stereo very disappointing. The handling was great but the ride and quietness was not in the Lexus league. The S-430 was'nt powerful enough. If we were goint to go MB it was going to be an S-500. When we finally went to test it against the LS430 we both looked at each other and knew it was still the car for us. But you will not here me knockdown the S-500 - it's a truly great and beautifully styled car. However where it edges out the LS430 is not important to us. We won't drive it the way you noted and prefer the quiet cabin, great ride and wonderful interior. We could'nt possibly take advantage of superior handling because most of the time we have 2 kids in the car including a 2 1/2 year old. I also don't see people on the road driving it the way you say you do. They take turns the same way I do - yes I see the brake lights go on - and I see many people driving 55mph in the right lane."
646,"February 22, 2001 5:54PM",ljflx,"I find the brakes are excellent, the handling is more than I need and as yet no one has passed out in the backseat. The backseat passengers actually are very complimentary about the car. Your problem seems to be the exception, not the rule. I also have a hard time believing it."
647,"February 22, 2001 6:24PM",44264,"ljflx -

I suppose we have different standards, with mine being more on the performance side.

The problem with the LS brakes I find, is its lack of response when first applied, lack of brake feel- your brakes are either on or off, if you know what I mean. I would not enjoy pushing the LS to its limit unlike the GS, S-class, 7-series or A8.

As a true 'back seat' luxury car, I find the S-class (stretched version) and 7-series (L wheel base) much roomier, the LS is simply too tight.

I like the quietness in the LS, although as mentioned, the soft suspension causing the excessive roll was not pleasant at all in the back..."
648,"February 22, 2001 7:04PM",ljflx,"You must have a chaffeur at least some of the time. My boss feels that way about his A-8 which is always driven by his chaffeur. By the way I did not know The S-class had a stretched version.

Let me clarify one other thing. When I say that my wife & I couldn't stand the S-Class interior it wasn't intended to mean it was shoddy. We both felt that it could be made more luxurious -paticularly given the cars price - but what I meant was MB's functional layout left a lot to be desired - particularly vs. that of Lexus which is so well thought out.

It's nice to see your a gentleman.

Last thing - don't know where your from but if you come to New York and take a taxi you'll find out what real ""body roll"" is."
649,"February 22, 2001 7:04PM",christchurch,"I appreciate your adding additional comments to our discussion of Jaguar motorcars.
I tend to agree with you that the XJ8 is probably an improvement over the ""the old workhorse"" engine of the XJ6, but may be more a matter of taste (dashboard configuration, etc., engine hp, etc.).

The safety issue is always one for me. I do think that the addition of side air bags increases ones protection in what is an otherwise quite safe vehicle.

Thanks for confirming the reliability of the Jag.
In the public mind this seems to be a caveat.

One further note, you say you drive them ""till they collapse"". Have you ever purchased an ""extended warrenty"" to cover what could be costly repairs? If so, what company have you found provided the best coverage and was the most reliable?

Any other purchase or ownership advice ?

Thanks, christchurch"
650,"February 22, 2001 7:52PM",44264,"Thanks for your kind words. Car selection is a very personal thing, there's no right and wrong. I wish the GS will have more room and the A8 would depreciate less..

When I mentioned the S-class stretched version, I meant the long wheel base. I have been in the short wheel base S-class and it doesn't offer much room in the back (rather tight similar to the LS) much less when compared to the 7-series iL or the A8.

I have experienced the NYC taxi ride and have been quite impressed. Actually, think the soft ride works very well with the road condition as well as the driver's aggressive style.. I have great respect for the drivers giving the passenger the biggest bang for the buck getting you from A to B in the shortest time."
651,"February 23, 2001 8:01AM",jarmstrong2,"Hello ChristChurch,Shezhad,arcoates,
I just bough a 1998 VandenPlas with 47k miles on in for 32. It is immaculate. Had it checked out and seems to be nothing wrong with car. I will have it checked out by a Jag dealer in my area. I bought a extended warranty from a co. called Herritage. It sounded good for me. Anyone know of the company? My wife is in serious love with this car and so am I. I have had 420SEL Benz, 3 Lexus
LS 400. But I LOVE the Jag. I hope I did the right thing as in long term reliability."
652,"February 23, 2001 8:06AM",denniswade,"for love. In fact, some previous owners complained when the reliability started to improve because it diluted the car's exclusivity -- it used to be that you had to own at least two cars, so you could drive the other while the Jag was in the shop! However, Jaguar quality is right near the top in the latest JD Powers surveys, so you may very well have the best of both worlds -- good luck with that sweet ride...!"
653,"February 23, 2001 9:58AM",shehzad,"I usually keep my cars until about 200-250K, and both I am my wife have offices far enough away that we end up putting around 25K on the cars every year. That said, I've never bought an extended warranty. I usually take the risk because 1.most of my miles are highway miles, which isn't as rough on the car as city, 2.in my experience most warranties either won't cover a car past 100k, or if they do, the cost is pretty prohibitive, or deductables are pretty large. I've been driving this distance for about 20 years, and in that time, EVERY car that both my wife and I have used as our primary vehicle (mercedes S & eclasses, BMW 5 & 7's,Audi v8, Rangerover, and even my one japanese car, a 1990 lexus ls400) has needed a transmission rebuild at some point between about 75K-130K. The rebuilds usually ended up costing about 2000-4000 dollars, depending on the car. Beyond that, I've been very fortunate in that I've never had any really prohibitive engine problem with any car I've driven. I should add that I've alway followed the manufacturers service specifications to a T, and been very fastidious about this. Moreover, I have a mechanic that I've been going to here in Northern Virginia for quite a few years, and the minute my warranty goes out, I know that my mechanic is trustworthy-and he gives me a 12k/12month warranty on any work he performs (as opposed to just 30 days at the dealer). Hence, I have quite the peace of mind that when something does go wrong that it will be fixed properly. Of all the cars I've owned, none has been as alluring to me as my XJ8, and although I always wanted one, I made a point of never owning a Jag as a daily driving machine b/c of their reliability issues. After my purchase though, thank god, and knock on wood, my XJ8 has been one of the better cars (better than the BMW's and Audi, about even w/ the mercedes, and worse than the Lexus)in terms of reliability, and after almost 60K it needs no work. I have no doubt that I will have to get the transmission worked on at some point, but beyond that the car is just as reliable in my mind as the day I bought it. These really are great cars."

656,"February 23, 2001 7:19PM",ljflx,"Thanks. Car selection (like everything else you buy) comes down to paying for the car that has what you want and not overpaying for what you don't need. I'm sure if I wanted handling I'd opt for the S-500. It's not that I don't want a good handling car - I certainly do - but the LS430 gives me pretty good handling with the best ride of any of these cars. That doesn't mean the S-500 doesn't ride well - in fact if the LS wasn't around its probably #1 in ride quality. But they do have to improve that interior.

I hope you gave that taxi driver a good tip. Beware the taxi driver you don't tip well and stumble upon a second time. Then you're in for a ride that you'll never forget."
657,"February 24, 2001 11:06PM",ljflx,"Article on the front page of the NY Times business section on Saturday told of major problems in its Freightliner truck divison and in its Debis financial services unit. Many trucks coming off lease and being returned to Freightliner at market values that are below lease estimates. Chrysler also continues to be a big problem. This article said for the first time that MB will now share parts (and presumably technology) with Chrysler. I can't believe that it took them this long to do something which was an obvious cost synergy and which should have been a major strategic rationale for the deal.

I did not read into the story that they are going to share platforms. I agree with you that a move like that will damage MB's stature and uniqueness. But I don't think sharing parts and technology crosses that boundary - at least that's my opinion. I certainly hope they don't share platforms as I plan to evaluate MB vs. Lexus again in 2004. A move like that would probably keep me away. It bothered me enough that my local MB dealership was rather small and tied in with Honda.

Anyway there will be a major announcement about all this on Monday by both the executive and supervisory boards of Daimler."

What gets me with you is that you read something then interpret it for something that it isn't. You've done that several other times in different topics. I don't want to say your a fountain of mis-information, but your reputation preceeds you with me. It would be sicking to any enthusiast for Toyota to get their hands on any European car brand. On another subject what does the 2002 Camry look like?

ljflx,

The whole merger is a nightmare. If Mercedes and Daimler don't get rid of Chrysler, Mercedes will be ruined. I didn't say DCX didn' have problems, I'm saying that I don't think the Germans will let Mercedes be pulled down the tubes with Chrysler, they'll un-merge first.

660,"February 25, 2001 4:30PM",ljflx,"Never in my life have I seen a company acquire as large a company as Chrysler (or one much smaller for that matter) only to divest of it within a year or two because it didn't know how to integrate it. I doubt that they will divest. I think they will share parts and technology but not platforms. Such a move would be prudent and not damage MB.

I doubt Toyota would be interested in a German car company be it MB or BMW. You can't buy MB as a stand-alone anyway and why would they want the problems and debt the rest of Daimler brings. They are doing very well on their own. Besides do you know how difficult it is to take over a German company? - nearly impossible. But if it were possible I doubt that a bunch of guys in a Boardroom would care about your or my feelings.

Last thing - they will protect MB as much as possible. But cash drains on other parts of the business will have an effect regardless. MB is too small to be spun out and auto companies bring low multiples."

663,"February 26, 2001 9:15AM",denniswade,"unless you can offer specifics about where I've misinterpreted information (or someone's opinion, for that matter), your criticism is meaningless. I think eveyone here (as well as in other topics in which you've participated) is well aware of your loyalty to the Mercedes marque, and I have never had any problem with that -- I feel the same way about Alfa Romeo. However, I do try to be objective and pleasant about my differences with you and others in this conference, and I hope you will show me the same respect I show you.

As to whether it would be desirable for Toyota to buy any European brand, Toyota is as respected there as it is here, and if they were to buy out D/C I would imagine that they would try to keep the design team as independant as possible in order to preserve the quality and spirit they bought the company for in the first place - unlike Mercedes' treatment of Chrysler, which was ham-handed and short-sighted at best. Ford has done exceedingly well with their acquisitions because they respected the traditions of the brands they acquired -- Mercedes has not (but thankfully, with Zetsche, appears to be changing course)."
664,"February 26, 2001 9:40AM",denniswade,"of what kind happen when one compny acquires another, Ford tried to acquire Alfa Romeo about 20 years ago, but Fiat lobbied the Italian government not to let that happen. Once Fiat had acquired Alfa, they quickly dissipated Alfa's predominance in their chosen segments and watered down the quality of their products to Fiat levels. Eventually this led to their abandonment of the US market due to Americans' dissatisfaction with their weird styling (remember the Milano?) and unreliability. I was hoping at the time that Ford WOULD acquire Alfa, because I knew it would mean more and better products and a much improved dealer network for Alfa Romeo in the US (I bought my first Alfa in Chicago, when the mext closest dealer was 250 miles away, in Detroit). Unfortunately, that never happened, and it is only GM's acquisition of a big chunk of Fiat that gives us hope that Alfa will return to the US in a couple more years.

Interestingly, the person who was responsible for the concept of the most successful car Alfa ever made -- the Giulietta Spider -- was Max Hoffman, the American distributor for a number of European marques in the fifties and sixties."
665,"February 26, 2001 11:26AM",merc1,"Well I did stop short of saying that you were a fountain of misinformation, but you alway try to paint a gloomy picture or some kind of picture that simply isn't there. Objective is always means that someone is in trouble to you. As far as Toyota's respect it isn't in question, what they would do with a European brand is. They couldn't begin to understand what would be at stake. Now the DCX merger is a mess, I'll agree on that, but as long as Mercedes isn't compromised I'm not really worried.

M"
666,"February 26, 2001 2:03PM",denniswade,"I don't think the situation is hopeless -- far from it. As a matter of fact, I've posted a memo elsewhere about the article I read over the weekend about how well Zetsche is doing in winning the respect and confidence of his American managers. The last thing I want is for Chrysler to be discarded or polluted by its German masters. Here's hoping they get it right -- because gloomy-sounding or not, their survival DOES depend on it.

You last comment, on the other hand, betrays your own bias (""As far as Toyota's respect it isn't in question, what they would do with a European brand is. They couldn't begin to understand what would be at stake. Now the DCX merger is a mess, I'll agree on that, but as long as Mercedes isn't compromised I'm not really worried."")

First, what in the world makes you think you know what Toyota would do with a European brand, and what exactly in their history leads you to believe they wouldn't respect its tradition? Toyota engineers bailed out Porsche several years ago, they have visits and clinics for automakers from all over the world and they have produced cars cheek-by-jowl with GM for years. They are also the most respected car company in the world, (according to Fortune magazine. The Corolla is one of the world's most popular cars in ANY country (it's one of the standard three cars you will find at European rental outlets), and they have a strong racing presence in Europe as well. Remember, it was Mercedes' attempt to keep up with the Toyotas that caused the loss of three of their cars at Le Mans.

As for your comment that you don't care what happens to Chrysler as long as Mercedes is okay, that's not only thoughtless -- there are a lot of people whose livelihoods are at stake here -- but short-sighted as well. Chrysler has produced some truly wonderful cars over the years, and to lose their heritage would be as tragic to me as if we lost Mercedes. I guess that's the biggest difference between you and me -- I'm not a one-brand guy, I love 'em all. But that doesn't mean ANY of them are perfect -- Toyota very much included."
667,"February 26, 2001 4:01PM",merc1,"I think you're reading too much (again) into what I said. I don't care what happens to Chrysler as far as their cars go...the company on the other hand I hope does well. My point is that Mercedes shouldn't be pulled down by what Chrylser can/can't do. Nobody said anything about people loosing their jobs or anything like that. I simply stated that what happens to Chrysler is not my imediate concern. You read different posts from what I wrote. Amazing. Now about Toyota being the most respected car company in the world, you know I doubt that. Mercedes would be that. The Mercedes name is priceless. Mercedes' brand recognition is higher also, much higher. The VW Beetle is just as if not more popular than the Corolla, since you're counting back from the start. You can rent an Accord here in the U.S. so whats the significance of the Corolla being one of the many cars you can rent in Europe??? Big deal.
Now what would lead me to believe Toyota wouldn't know what to do with or wouldn't respect a European brand? Try their total lack of ""tradition"" to begin with. Try their blatant copying of anything European that is succesful. It's so silly the length they'll go through to ""be like"" someone else. . All the Japanese do is copy. They ought to be tired of it by now. As far as that LeMans comment goes, what are you talking about? I know you don't think that because of a win by someone else Mercedes lost their cars because of they were trying to catch someone? Please tell me that isn't what you're saying. If that's the case everyone in racing has lost a car trying to ""catch"" someone else. Porsche needed help, you're right, but it was in the area of saving costs more than design, of which the Japanese know very little. GM needs Toyota's help more than anybody else. GM is dying very slowly. For the record I'm not a ""one brand guy"" either, I like them all too, but I have my favorites. I know you knew that.

Fortune magazine is not an authority on who the most respected car company is. They can tell you that how much money the company has made and their business savy, but that doen't always translate into respect. Respect comes from other factors than just what a money/business magazine says about a car company. I agree that Toyota would be in the top 5, but not not number 1.

I wanted to say that Dante should have had a special circle of hell for people who can not afford cars they like (me), take years to decide, and want the next thing (always). My own view (and it is contary to convential wisdom I know) is that cars are getting worse and not better. It isn't just Mercedes that is making cars more cheaply- not at all. Volkswagen is no different than Daimler.
The new A4 has 7 % more plastic. In fact, you can see some of it in interior pictures. They can not afford to build the current A6 and the next one will be decontented. The A6 doesn't need a facelift!

677,"February 28, 2001 2:34AM",44264,"How do you define a *better* car?

To me, cars are getting better everyday. Cars are safer, more fuel efficient, more comfortable and they perform far better than ever before.

The amount of plastic or the cost of production has little to do with how I personally evaluate a car. We do not live in the dark ages where one judges a car by the quality of the woodwork or leather alone.

I feel that many of us has gotten so picky and spoiled that we are missing the big picture of the progression of automobiles.

Advance passive and active safety, fuel efficiency, aerodynamcis, acceleration, braking and cornering performances, comfort level, ride, noise, convenience features, damages to the environment etc. are FAR more relevant and meaningful in my opinion."
678,"February 28, 2001 3:01AM",hello26,"We don't need to miss the big picture! The big picture is that there are huge holes in the Earth's atmosphere! The BEST car, thefore is the Toyota Prius. It is SULEV according too California law. Zero emissions vehicles are something of a (don't know what the right word is) because batteries equals power plants equals pollution. If you want to have an ideology of modern versus dark ages, the progression of mankind, etc. I'd suggest you've hit on it with your concern for the environment. If we want to pay more than lip service to those concerns, 5000 Prius' in the US and a five month waiting period from TOYOTA is not acceptable.

However, you've thrown a lot into the mix! Cars are more safe (this does not do us much good in the US when 1/2 the passengers vehicles are SUVs and trucks, which again, is bad from an environmental point of view).

Wait a minute. Plastic is bad from an environmental point of view- do you know what you have to put in the air to produce it?

You would not want to say that cars were better and better period, because if you did you would
be saying what advertising is saying- of course the car companies want you to think that everything that is new is better.

What else have you put in the mix? Ride and noise. On this I must diagree. Ford Escort, Ford Taurus, Honda Accord, Honda Civic, Subaru Legacy, Toyota Corolla are examples of cars that VIBRATE and are LOUD and CRUDE compared to what they were pre-2000. You CAN MAKE a car cheap to the point that is has no quality. Why would you do that? To save yourself money and to increase your profit.

Now who said anything about judging a car based on wood and leather alone? The cars on this list and German luxury cars (and Japanese and American) are
not about ""saving the environment"", are they?
They are about going AS FAST AS YOU CAN TOXIC EXHAUST PIPE EMISSION BE (can't say it, can't abbreviate it .

I have seen cars from the early 70's to now. Guess what- they are very different, and they change all the time. Fans of Mercedes-Benz know what I am talking about. If you are considering
the cars on this list, or similar cars, you get to judge the car by absolute standards- does it vibrate, how does it handle, how fast does it go,
anything you want, anything at all. By these standards, plastic in cars, in engines, in bodies, in interiors, is not necessarily a good thing!

Cars are better, over-all. It would be a miserable world if every car belched out what American cars did in the early 70's. Cars are more safe (head airbags are a miracle if you know what a head injury can do to a human being).
I'm sorry, I only meant in a sense (in the sense relevant to luxury cars), I think the cars of NOW have value in a way that the cars of the near future will not."

I think if you're looking at a luxury car, you're sybaritically indulging and wasting money as it is, and questioning someone else's decision to buy a more or less expesnive car is silly. When I bought my Jag XJR, the $ consideration of ""value over the XJ8"" was not even remotely present in my head. $10,000 more or less - I don't give a damn once I have decided I am burning over $60k on a car anyway. And if someone goes and spends over $100k, fine.

It utterly amazes me when people say whether a Lex is a ""better buy"" than some German lux-mobile. Once you start that, hey, a Toyota Camry is an even better buy, you know.

The concept of luxury is get what friggin' simply sybaritically appeals to you, and more or less damn the cost. Heck, you can blow over $100k on a wristwatch if you want to. Easy. Try explaining *that* to people who are stunned by luxury car prices...

The world is full of thoroughly enjoyable stuff that would seem crazily overpriced to the middle-class minded person. Think a $200k Bentley is expensive? Well, how about spending $8,000 on one Brioni suit? $150k on an IWC Grande Complication wristwatch (and there's more expensive ones out there, some might regard that a ""reasonable buy"")? $600 on Lorenzo Banfi shoes? $6,000 on a Namiki or Montegrappa ink pen? Heck, there's a million ways to spend a lot of money, and they're far less visible than cars. As Adam Smith, the father of market economy, established, the price of something has nothing to do with its true cost - merely with its perceived value."
685,"February 28, 2001 8:36PM",ljflx,How about $10mln on a house? The question is do you buy to please yourself or to impress others. I'm in the first group and don't care what others think.
686,"February 28, 2001 9:24PM",pablo_l,"...that is impossible to tell without knowing the person. Money spent on ""impressing others"" is always wasted, because it's simply neber enough. Money spent on pleasing oneself is always perfectly spent, as far as I am concerned. Whether it is a $10m home or something else, who am I to tell without knowing the person? It's presumptuous to judge others on appearances. And if they're trying to impress, they invariably are pathetic noveau rich folk condemned to fail."
687,"March 1, 2001 8:53AM",denniswade,"I think you should buy what most appeals to you within your budget (self-imposed or otherwise). If price or other quantifiable creteria were the only consideration, no one in their right mind would ever buy a Rolls, would they?

Fact is, when magazines do comparison tests they try to find competing models as close to the same purchase price as possible -- a fair process, I think -- and when compared against the V8 versions of the S and 7, the LS430 fares extremely well. The fact that it's less expensive is either a bonus or, in the case of less well-heeled customers, is what makes it affordable in the first place. There are persistent rumors of a V12 version of the Lexus, and if they actually bring one to market I'm sure everyone will have to revisit their assessments."
688,"March 1, 2001 9:35AM",wbwynn,"I agree with the previous posts about buying what pleases you and respect the different decisions. But, as denniswade says, when comparing vehicles in the LS's luxury segment of the market, a $15,000 differential in price is a meaningful point of contention...notwithstanding anyone's right or ability to throw money away.

All of the ""so-called"" independent reviews of this segement come to the same basic conclusion...the LS430 is a bonfide, serious alternative to the Europeans. As a previous owner of both BMW and MB, I just bought my first Lexus...because it was the better vehicle in most areas...not all. The performance handling crown may still belong to Europe, but my decision to buy an LS had this issue ranked lower in terms of importance. (secretly, if I really want performance and a quickening pulse, I'd cram myself into a Porsche and be on my merry way!!)

Bottomline, the serenity of the interior, build quality, plenty of performance for my taste, reliability, price edge, etc. just seem to make an overwhelming case for the LS430."
689,"March 1, 2001 9:51AM",flint350,"It seems to me this ""money no object"" theme is getting way off the point. The car mag comparo analogy used by denniswade is much more accurate IMO. The idea is to compare apples to apples and keeping it all in perspective. It's an overall comparison of similar price/features/style/value, etc. That's why Bentley and Rolls and Lamborghini are not in the title of the group. While MB fans tout their heritage and handling, BMW fans talk of their aggressive driving and handling and Lexus fans talk of their luxury and reliability. Obviously, these different features are what attracted each person to begin with. There is, of course, some blending of all these things in each car. What got this off course is the defensive reaction to ""value"" comments made by the Lexus owners (which I admit, I am one). As an LS430 owner, I not only love my car, I can also appreciate its value compared to the others properly mentioned in this group. I agree with ljflx, all are fine cars. I heavily researched all of them and chose the Lexus for reasons of my own. While I didn't buy it just because it is a better value, I am not ashamed that it is. I do not understand the occasional defensive attitude, esp. from the MB folks, when value is mentioned. It doesn't lessen the quality of my car. It is, in my opinion, an added benefit. I gave up very little to get that added value. I only yield to MB and BMW in aggressive handling, but as someone said, how often do you really drive that aggressively. And if you do, then choose something else. On the other hand, my Lexus is far and away superior in terms of luxury, fit and finish, general quality and at least equal in features. Of course, the style police are waiting to pounce and I can only add that while I agree the MB is styled somewhat better, I do not find the Lexus styling all that bad. To me, it is a total package decision and there are just too many pluses for the Lexus and too many negatives for the others. I would have spent the extra money for something extra. Value was not my first priority, but I am not unhappy that it was included ""free of charge""."
690,"March 1, 2001 2:11PM",is4b2rd,"They would admit that the reason they choose the MB and BMW, besides the obvious glorious ride and handling is the status. I am not ashamed to admit that I chose Mercedes because of perceived status. Of course my new CL is not very noticeable to most people, which pisses me off.
:-)

But if I could get over the ""prestige factor"", I'd definitely purchase an LS430 over the MB S-CLass or BMW 7-series. Frankly, the interior of the new S-Class leaves MUCH MUCH MUCH to be desired. The interior has been so decontented, that it would be more appropiate in a 20k-30k vehicle, not a 70k plus.

People should realize that Lexus is only about 11 years old, and I think they have learned over those 11 years, and that is why you see higher quality leather in the new LS, compared with the old. Also, I think they did well for themselves in the style department by keeping a same basic look from the beginning. They are starting their OWN styling legacy.

And, when I graduate from prestige withdrawal, I will be at a Lexus dealer with check in hand. :-)"
691,"March 1, 2001 2:15PM",is4b2rd,"When the new Jaguar XJ-series comes out next year, their styling will TROUNCE all over BMW and Mercedes. I hope they do well with the interior and assembly so that they can take a big chunk of the luxo car market. :-)

I've heard that the new Jag will have an aluminum body and suspension bits. It will be a site to see. Now, THAT I'd buy over the LS. Not for prestige but because their cars are so darn gorgeous."
692,"March 1, 2001 2:56PM",bwh,"The reasoning behind choosing BMW over Mercedes and Lexus was not the status symbol. By now doesn't the general public recognize the big Lexus, or any Lexus for that matter, as a premium, and expensive automobile? One big reason was the styling, I just love the aggressive look of my BMW. IMO the current 7 series is one of the best looking cars on the road today. I also liked the interior of the BMW best. It is very driver oriented. I agree on the S class interior wholeheartedly, not much to look at in this price range. While some accuse me of emphasizing the handling aspect of the BMW, I think you are missing the point. The BMW ""feels"" much better to me just loafing down the freeway. It is tied to the road better than the others. I don't mind hearing the bumps in the road. The steering feedback is superior in the BMW as well. I think it plain drives better ALL of the time, not just when pressed. Given the opportunity to run it hard, it is very fun to drive. I found the others to be very competant but less engaging, isolated if you will. I have a Porsche for going fast, maybe this has led to my bias towards BMW."
693,"March 1, 2001 3:26PM",pathdoc,Does anyone think the aluminum body will discourage sales of the new XJ8? I believe the Audi A8 also uses aluminum. What are the implications for the availabilty of repair facilities for body work on aluminum vehicles? I believe this used to be a problem with some of the older British sports cars (? A/C Bristol).
694,"March 1, 2001 4:21PM",pablo_l,"My major gripe with BMW and Mercedes is their overly tidy, somewhat teutonic and cold interiors. Great leather and wood, but a bit too plasticky here and there. But that is all a matter of personal taste. Despite the fact I am half-German, I think Jag interiors beat the hell out of Teutonic designs when it comes to warmth and coziness. But some people don't like the library atmosphere, of course... :-)

And, hey, I am the first to love Jags, I do own an XJR, and I had the XJS coupe before. But you can see, year by year, how yet another square inches are sacrificed to plastic out of the Ford parts bin. I, for one, do not like the Jag S-class interior all that much.

And the new Jag XJ, from what I have seen, does not look all that mind-boggling. Just a big S-class, a bit more stately. I do think Jaguar will become less remarkable with the new shapes, but hey, it's the way things go. I have never been a big fam of the XK-coupe, for one, it was far less distinctive than the XJ-S, and looks somewhat like a Camaro from too many angles.

And then, of course, Jag will further murk the waters with their X-type. Currently, Jaguar service is one of their major differentiators. Once you crowd the service department with entry-level luxury cars, we'll see how it holds up.

Granted, I would have never bought Jags if Ford wouldn't have straightened them out and delivered on quality. But now, let's see what the future holds.

The current XJR, to me, is somewhat of a bargain. Loads of power, an exquisite Baby-Bentley interior, and unique classic styling in the 60s... I very much doubt the new platform will deliver on all those counts.

As to Lexus - great car and all, but the styling is so bland, sorry, not for me. It does *0* to raise anyone's pulse, it is a perfect, yet utterly passion-less car. I do expect more for a luxury car, more committment to risk and legacy. For instance, the SC430 right now is an odd looking car, but at least they had the guts to try something different. The LS430 is a bit like, uh, let's take a Camry and make it look somewhat more stately..."
695,"March 1, 2001 5:49PM",xjs5,"The new LS is a copy of the new S Class genereration released to the market the previous year. This has been argued, proven with photographs, and beaten to death. I don't look at the A8 and see a Volkwagen Jetta conspiracy.
The ES is a Camry but I wouldn't say that about the LS."
696,"March 1, 2001 6:30PM",pablo_l,"I didn't mean the Camry comparison to be taken literally, it was to emphasize the fact that Lexus takes no risks whatsoever in the design.

And, visually, I see no similarities between the Lex LS430 and the Merc S class. The new Merc S-class went for a more refreshing image. The happy face lights and a lighter overall presence do represent a certain design risk. I *do* know people who prefered the more conservative and massive presence of the old Merc S class. So I have to give kudos to Mercedes for taking some risk with the new design, and going for discontinuity. Lexus does no such thing - there are no adventures in design whatsoever. No one will ever say ""I don't like it at all!"", but no one will ever say ""It's a gorgeous car!"" either, when refering to the design itself.

Don't get me wrong - the Lexus is a phenomenal car: superbly engineered and balanced and all. But it is truly not a car that is *passionate*. Neither is the BMW 7-series, by the way, which I find equally unexciting design wise.

The Audi A8 has class Audi design elements in there, it is recongizable. Not that Audi ever does for big risks in their design, either. It's clean lines, but also somewhat unexciting.

I guess that it's simply the fact that *all* cars are starting to look more and more similar, since, like politicians, they morph themselves into something that appeals to the lowest common denominator. That leads to a certain blandness.

The Jaguar here has the ""classic"" edge pure and simply because it *is* the oldest design. Updated and all, but still. If the spy shots I have seen of the new model are anything to go by, I will not truly consider the new car, just like I didn't consider the XKR all too seriously after the XJS. The newer models are far more anonymous.

You would think the success of the New Beetle or the kudos the New Mini get would make car designers see that people do reward originality and classic, recognizable design cues. If I were Jag, I would make the new XJ look like the old one, with updated lines and an utterly new base. Keep it different. I would not go for the S-class design, only bigger, which seems to be the road ahead."
697,"March 1, 2001 9:14PM",ljflx,"Speed up that graduation to Lexus because when you get there you'll be very happy. Besides, the valet guys who park my LS430 certainly treat me and the car with a lot of prestige. They park it right up front in the big spaces where it doesn't get scratches. In fact when I went to Peter Lugers (best steakhouse on Earth in case you don't know the name)in Brooklyn the doorman let me park it at the fire hydrant right in front of the restaurant entrance. The Rolls and Bentleys were around the corner. By the way the fire hydrant in front of Peter Lugers is probably the only fire hydrant in all of NYC that you can park your car in front of and not worry about getting a ticket."

I wonder if you or anybody has actual test data of dba level for 2001 LS430, BMW740, MB S500/430 & others. (at engine idle, 30MPH, 60MPH & 90MPH perhaps.) When I tested driving LS430, I actually was expecting a much quieter ride than I got. Very noticeable noise came from both the engine as well as the fan outlets. I may be wrong, but I did not feel LS430 was noticeably quieter than S500 with normal suspension. I think dba readings comparison by independent authorities would be more scientific evidence of your claim."

As to Lexuses getting preferential treatment over Rolls in valets, please, that's a bit too much. Put it down to parking spot dynamics, not to general car superiority or something.

You're happy with your car, great. But I'll never ""graduate"" to a car that stimulates my senses about as much as watching paint dry on a closet. I am more than happy with what I have, only I am not on a mission to make you accept it is some superior choice."

BMW has the best driving cars. The rest of us might as well be driving Hyundais.

I love my car, but the Lexus is awesome as well. My decision was more of a ""feel"" issue...I felt the most comfort/fun for ME was in the MB. I also just love the way it looks (and although I love the Lexus interior, I really do not like the exterior). I simply got tire of past experiences with BMW and Audi vehicles which had a myriad of unsolvable electrical issues. I guess I got lucky with a MB which (knock, knock) has been trouble-free. I've never owned a Jag because at my size (6'3"", 230 lbs.), I can't seem to fit comfortably...but the smell of the leather in a Jag cannot be duplicated.
Sorry for the ranting."

Our now departed arcoates, for one, roundly chastised us all for listening to the journalists. But when the journalists agree on the ONE styling ""weakness"" in the Lexus, it is quickly pointed to as ""fact"".
Pablo, I submit it is the Benz fans who become defensive. Read the S-Class board (which I'm sure you do) and the myriad reports of problems and noises and dealer service nightmares, etc. When that is pointed out, they usually become defensive of their choice. They shouldn't be and neither should we Lexus owners. We're probably beating this into the ground, but we all made our choices for our personal reasons and tend to share them across brands. I'm happy for blehrlich, for instance, that he got a trouble-free S Class. My personal point is, that he is lucky. Many more did not (read the posts - these are S Class owners saying these things). In the case of the Lexus, I get virtually all the features of the MB and none of the problems. My interior is far nicer and my exterior isn't a problem for me. The handling isn't far behind the Benz, but isn't that important. And I, for one, am not on a mission to force your acceptance of a Lexus. You have diff. priorities and I honor that. ljflx is obviously passionate about his choice - a car which you state has no passion. I am also passionate about my choice. Every time I drive it, I thoroughly enjoy it. Maybe for different reasons than you, but it inspires my passion. I note your honest admission that the Lexus is a fine automobile, except for the exterior styling which also inhibits the BMW. I am sure the Bimmer fans would disagree. Passion, as beauty, is where each of us finds it. And I hope I don't sound ""defensive"" when I say I didn't find it necessary to spend an extra $20k for it. Because I would have."

It was a automatic sale. But couldn't afford a new one so purchased used. Went thru one more then purchased a 420 SEL. I loved the car because of the tradition but wanted a more confortable ride. Bought another Lexus LS400. Now I will cut all the hot air. After a while my brother really wanted the Lexus, so my wife and I test drove a Jag. The traditonal, confortable ride, handling, and power was unbelievable. I read all the reviews on realiability, which is now not a problem. Now I own a 99 JAG VDP.

I wanted a MB E-320 or 430 but those cars had ridiculous lease payments at 20k miles per year. The LS 430 is a far better car than either and the payments were just slightly more at that mileage level. Look I can easily afford an S-600 if I so desired but I'm sure glad I have LS430's and I know that I bought the better car for MY needs and driving style. Your quite welcome to think I'm defensive though if it so pleases you. I read the posts on this board quite differently than you and see the MB buyers as defensive. I think the BMW buyers seem more sure of themselves.

710,"March 2, 2001 10:24AM",pablo_l,"...I hardly ever see them truly rank upper luxury vehicles. They point out the measurable and relative fact, and then readily admit that all cars have huge advantages. And when they rank cars, typically you'll find a test for every result (except seing Jags finish first, but I am sure I'd only have to find myself a Brit mag). The statistical relevance of rankings in tets is thus unconclusive. What *is* mentioned every time journalists write about the LS430 is bland styling. Each and every time. *That* has statistical relevance. What it does not have is any impact on the other, and multiple, car's qualities. It's not like the old S-class or the 7-series does anything for my eyes, either. They all simply follow the ""stately presence"" block appearance. That's all.

I don't believe at all in the premise of any car being better than another. It's a better choice for something/somebody, period. I do dislike silly pontification and overly tedious ""this is how wonderful my car is"" tales.

And I certainly won't be trying to convince myself my Jag ranks up there with a Ferrari or Rolls in ultimate uniqueness, luxurious excess or prestige. I'll leave that to one delusionary LS owner, it seems. Who in a further display of balanced objectivity told me I had to ""graduate to a Lexus"".

These are *all* fantastic cars. I know several S-class owners, and am not aware of any abysmal reliability record. But I also won't dispute the fact that Lexuses have achieved legendary dependability, and that is a powerful asset.

In each and every one of my messages, I have pointed out I am highly aware the Lexus is a phenomenal car, first and foremost, and simply pointed out the style critique that is an entirely personal and ultimately meaningless impression."

You go on to say that ""What it does not have is any impact on the other, and multiple, car's qualities."" True again -- qualities such as class-leading build quality and reliability, which most definitely ARE quantifiable.

Fact is, Mercedes has always been very conservative until recently, with the exception of the SL series, and I see nothing wrong with that. BMW has always had an Italian flair to my eye, which is something I really love about them, and still do. And while I truly wish Lexus would dsign a more exciting LS430, it is a car I would be unlikely to buy in the first place -- I'd go for the GS400 (performance) or SC430 (style) instead -- neither of which can be construed as bland."

""Our now departed arcoates, for one, roundly chastised us all for listening to the journalists"".

Let me make it very clear that never did I chastise anyone for listening to journalists. I rely heavily upon them to educate me on new cars, because I can't possibly drive all of the myself. More than once I quoted a car magazine, so it would be more accurate to say that I chastised someone for NOT listening to them. And the fact is, that all of the ones I read do not favour the LS over anything else in this class. But I'm not back here to argue again. In the future, please don't put words into my mouth. Thanks~ A.R."
717,"March 2, 2001 2:50PM",pablo_l,"...I did mention all along, too, that since design appeals to personal taste, it certainly is up to the individual. It's like with suits - most buyers of expensive suits will buy fabrics that do *not* stand out, and the qualities are very low key. It's all personal style.

As to ""quality"" being quantifiable, or even reliability, that is up to debate. You know what they say about lies, damn lies and statistics. They are infomrational, but they are not the ultimate tool. And I have yet to truly hear the Mercedes S-class has reliability problems. Mercedes' reputation for durability doesn't come from nowhere. My mother still drives her '81 240D, and having taken care of it it looks and works pristinely with well over 150k miles on it. It's *never* broken down. Lexus has a while to go until it establishes such a long-lived track record. Yes, this is surrounded, too, by perception and thus a gray area.

People also simply decide on trade-offs they are going to make. Jaguar sure doesn't have the long lived reputation for reliability, but to me at this point they are more than reliable enough. I can get lucky or have bad luck with *any* car brand. I *do* know a Lexus GS400 owner that has had persistent gremlins in his car. There is always one out there.

Nothing is quite as ""factual"" and ""established"" as we often would like to think.

Buying a car simply is not a scientific process. Particularly not when you spend this much money - it is an irrational process to start with. We all decide on one of these cars because we buy into some more intangible, intuition and passion based value proposition.

They are all amazing displays of craftmanship and engineering."
718,"March 2, 2001 5:02PM",xjs5,"Your post seems to indicate that car design is subjective. Your very well thought out post about Audi and Jaguar styling makes clear that
you understand that car design is a matter of objective elements. Your objective criteria get replaced with ""It's all personal style"" when you talk about Lexus.

I think you should reconsider the car magazine Lexus double-speak about Lexus styling. Lexus is the most unoriginal design in the world. If it is not original, it came from somewhere else.

Can it be criticized for not being commited to design legacy when the legacy it would be committed to is its own? What legacy is that?
The 1990 Lexus was derived from Mercedes. The new one?

The car is so perfect it is boring. The opposite of perfect is flawed. Is perfection boring? Is flawed exciting?

I know car magazines mean ""something"" but ""I'm bored with perfection."" is very cynical.

I know it's 11 years old but do you think Lexus has to establish itself for reliablity and durability?

Car decisions might be personal, subjective, and irrational, but when you look at Lexus what you see is a ""blank slate"". You have yet to hear of recurring reliablity problems in the S Class?
Mercedes has an established reputation for durability but Lexus doesn't have a track record?
Is reputation qualitative and track record quantifiable? I enjoy your posts but you seem to keep changing the terms of your argument when it comes to Lexus."
719,"March 2, 2001 5:27PM",pablo_l,"...and the choice is equally subjective when it comes to all other brands, not just Lexus.

Lexus is just as valid a choice and contender for automobile excellence as anyone else. I do not dispute that.

And that is as far as the objectivity goes.

Everything that follows is far more murky. The concept of style is a matter of personal preference. Sure car designers set themselves goals, and I mentioned a few messages back those objectives seem to be becoming more and more similar. I did not really single out Lexus. I mentioned Audi and BMW do little for *my* eye, too. And that the next generation Jag seems to look bland.

And my personal perception is that, yes, Mercedes has taken risks in their latest designs, and given where the car industry stands, I have to applaud that. Am I a huge fan of the S-class and thus biased? Why would I have bought a Jaguar XJR then? I jyst call it as I see it, personally, and try to stay objective.

I am *not* a Lexus basher at all. I have said about 20 times I think it a phenomenal car, but the fact I don't *like* the lines of the design is taken as an attack against the brand, when in fact I state all along it is utterly irrelevant.

And yes, I do not think relaibility *problems* with the S-class are an established fact. Mind you, personally I think the reliability reputation of German cars is not quite justified anymore - they certainly do not stand head and shoulders aboive everybody else anymore. And my personal BMW experience was not devoid of gremlins. Great car, but it did act up a few times. More than the Citroen 2CV I owned as a student. But that is all such circumstancial evidence...

What *is* important is service. I hear Lexus offers great service, and that is key to the luxury segment. I do think Mercedes and BMW have bogged their service departments' excellence down with too many models. My wife has a Mercedes (and she is totally happy), but I know the Jaguar service department is a more pleasant experience. Might easily change when they come out with the X type.

And most definitely Lexus does not have one thing - tradition. It might be important to some, immaterial to others. But hey, all companies got started somewhere, and personally I have no doubt that 20 years down the line Lexus will have a legendary tradition of excellence.

Oh, and I should mention I think the SC430 styling is gutsy, so kudos to Lexus for that. Looks somewhat odd now, which might very well mean it'll turn into a classic."
720,"March 2, 2001 6:26PM",ejerod,"Guys, Guys, Guys... Like I said, I drive the MB S500, but I'll be honest, it took me a full 6 months to make up my mind between it , the LS430, and the BMW740il. Every single one of these cars are phenomenally engineered. Intead of us letting testosterone get the best of us we should all be counting our blessings that we can afford to drive any of these fine automobiles. Yes I chose the Benz for it's heritage, engineering and styling, but it won my money be one or two votes. Let's breathe, take a minute and realize that to even drive these cars one has to be in the top 1-3% of income earners in the US. That in and of itself is the true blessing. We could all be in Hyundais or worse yet homeless.I'm sure that most of us live in fine homes that these car compliment when we enter our driveways. I didn't buy the Lexus, but if they had a more agressive looking body style I would have.. Happy motoring."
721,"March 2, 2001 6:54PM",xjs5,"Choice is subjective.
Lexus is a valid choice (contender, whatever).
That is where the objectivity ends.
It didn't even start. I don't see how it can end.

-Lexus copied the Mercedes (twice).
-Whether the S Class has recurring problems or not is not a matter of opinion.
-Lexus has established a reputation for reliability and durability.
-Styling is not subjective. Whether you like it or not is subjective.

Mercedes never has a problem and Lexus has to prove itself? It sounds like a double standard to me.

BTW, the Pontiac Aztec is gutsy, odd, risk- taking, and not bland. I hope the SC430 has something else going for it."
722,"March 2, 2001 7:10PM",ljflx,"I wholeheartedly agree with you. But the competitive fires in all of us is what has made us all successful (I assume) enough to afford these cars in the first place. Thus we are people who are prone to debate their merits. As long as we keep it clean and don't hit below the belt and insult each other, it is healthy. Sometimes it gets a little too emotional but if we are pros we can reign it in - witness Pablo and I in earlier posts today. And maybe, though this is a long-shot, the manufacturers are following some of the debate and draw upon the content to improve their cars. Good luck to you with your S-500. You couldn't have gone wrong or been unhappy with either of the other cars you were evaluating so though it took you 6 months you were always in a no lose situation. Now I wish you can help us out with this 2 feet plus of snow they are expecting up here in the NY/NJ area starting Sunday. I finally got my cars clean and can see my lawn and now more snow."
723,"March 2, 2001 8:41PM",flint350,"I thought I recalled a comment by you about the car mags. That's what prompted my remark above. In going back, this is what I found in your earlier post, so I stand by what I said:
""You americans think that Motor Trend and Car and Driver count for a lot. The rest of the world thinks that most of the american publications are so yankee biased, and only care about SUV's and big american V8's.""
Not trying to re-ignite an argument, I was just making a point in a healthy debate."
724,"March 2, 2001 10:13PM",pablo_l,"I don't see a double standard, since I have mixed in critical coments about all brands. You are being too defensive. And I didn't say a word about Lexus copying Mercedes, so do not mix in comments from someone else.
And I can't recall saying the Aztec and the SC430 share anything. You are making your own argument up."
725,"March 3, 2001 3:44AM",xjs5,I'm starting to see your logic. You offer both praise and criticism of all brands therefore you do not have a double standard. You didn't say a word about Lexus copying Mercedes. You did not offer comment about Lexus copying Mercedes but you did comment on it when I brought it up. You did not say that the Aztec and the SC430 share anything. I said they do so that is correct. I am making my own arguments up. Yes. This is the best I can do so I hope you will not be offended
726,"March 3, 2001 7:46AM",arcoates,"I knew that was the one you were referring to. And if you look at it carefully, I was not critisizing anyone for listening to auto journalists, I was just saying that in my opinion, most of the american car magazines have lost their credibility. Can anyone here say that Motor Trend's Car of the Year or Car and Drivers 10Best is really groundbreaking anymore? They pick what the public wants to here, so in that particular issue, they will sell more copies. But that's another conversation.

But, I rely heavily upon such publications as Edmunds.com, CAR, Automobile, and Road and Track for my info. And what I read, Lexus has definetly stepped up, but is not the best out there.~ A.R."
727,"March 3, 2001 9:54AM",pablo_l,"I didn't make a single comment on Lexus copying from Mercedes, either. I am sure all brands look at what the other does, and look at ways of integrating good ideas without making it too obvious.
And as you can imagine, even though I am not a big fan of the Aztek design, I do think it a great thing that car manufacturers go for more distinct designs.
And no one doubts the SC430 is a phenomenal car. Very desirable convertible, if I was in the market for a top convertible right now, the Lex would be up there among the 2-3 finalists."
728,"March 3, 2001 2:15PM",denniswade,"arcoates: AutoWorld Weekly did a comparison test in their Feb27 issue between the BMW 740iL, Mercedes S430, Jaguar XJ8L and the LS430 in which the BMW came out on top, followed only a half point behind by the Lexus, which they described as having ""best in class"" fit and finish and ergonomics and a strong engine (it was the quickest of the four). The Mercedes came in third (criticized for its weak engine, transmission, interior ergonomics and interior materials), and the Jaguar a distant fourth (although they loved the style and cache of both the brand and the car).

pablo: You've never impressed me as being unreasonable, so I don't know what you've said to provoke some of the people here; that said, your comment that ""Mercedes' reputation for durability doesn't come from nowhere...Lexus has a while to go until it establishes such a long-lived track record"" is partly true -- Mercedes had a reputation for years as the most durable car on the planet, until Lexus raised the bar with their very first LS400. It's been over ten years now, which I think is more than adequate time to establish the validity of people's perceptions about Lexus quality."
729,"March 3, 2001 4:45PM",xjs5,"You never said that Lexus copied from Mercedes.
Ok. This is the right answer.

This is what you meant in 728. where you also said ""don't mix in comments from someone else"".

I did not mix in comments from someone else when I talked about your comments.

'And, visually, I see no similarit- between the Lex430 and the MercS class.' 700

These are your comments.

Did I say you said that Mercedes copied Lexus?

Here's what I meant when I said""You did not offer comment about Lexus copying Mercedes but you did comment on it when I brought it up. "" 729 :

You did not bring up [the subject] of Lexus copying Mercedes but you did comment [on the subject] when I brought it up (see above) and you implied that it was not the case.

Mercedes was daring. Lexus was bland.
If Lexus copied Mercedes, both would have to be daring or bland, since we were talking about the
styling- the objective facts of the styling (the ones that you did not see), daring styling, bland styling- not the same thing.

When I bring it up, you change your tune.
'I'm sure they do, so what.'

Some human kindness might be in order. My post was reconciliatory. My post was friendly. Maybe you can spend 10 seconds thinking about what
other people might reasonalby mean instead of insisting on what YOU REALLY mean all the time and calling people ""defensive"" when they get frustrated.

I apologize to the board for boring you to death"
730,"March 3, 2001 4:58PM",pablo_l,"...there's no test, and truly no animosity on my side. You seem under the impression I dilsike or attack Lexus unfairly, when in fact I know it is a brand I have a lot of respect for. Mr denniswade has a very valid point when he says Lexus has established a high bar for reliability. I have not disputed that anywhere. That said, I also know Mercedes does not all of a sudden have a reputation for quirky and oft-breaking cars - that is an overzealous statement.

And I am not sure where you go with the Lexus copying Mercedes argument. I seem to sense you mean that since I mentioned the new Mercedes S class is daring, to *you* Lexus copied from Mercedes and thus must be considered a refreshing design, too. On this matter, all personal opinions are qually valid. But to me the new Lex LS430 looks a lot like the old LS400, and not at all like a new Merc S-class. That is just my opinion, and not something I want to try to establish as universal law."
731,"March 3, 2001 7:06PM",ejerod,"Yeah, you're right about competitive fires. I can hardly go to a function without someone asking "" and what is it that you do ? "" That's one thing I do enjoy about the heritage of Mercedes, as they said in the Edmunds Review ""big Mercedes Benz Sedans scream success!"" I know I know, I own a Lexus product too, the 99 GS 300 my wife drives and I love that car too!!! But I drove by the MB dealership the other day and lo and behold a CLK55 on the showroom floor!!! Now to talk to wife into test driving that baby to see maybe if she's tired of the GS. If not, then the Lexus SC430 is due out this month, that should be interesting to.

Things continue this way, and I will have to work again for a salary, as opposed to working for fun... :-) Now that is a novel concept... :-) <- Kinda bitter smile there, though...

And a close friend of mind works in a Jag dealership (you know you've bought to many cars and paid too much for them when your sales guy becomes one of your close friends...!), and he tells me things *suck* in the luxury car sales sector. Our CEO wanted to buy some spceial 7-series Beemer, and was initially told he'd have to wait a year, now he gets calls with a discounted offer every week... :-)"
733,"March 4, 2001 6:09PM",ljflx,My portfolio was hammered to and in fact I don't know anyone's who hasn't been. Hang in there though - some companies are really undervalued including Daimler. Greenspan kept rates too high too long but that's a subject for another board. When I make purchase decisions I do it on spendable money (take home pay) and not based on the portfolio which is subject to such volatility.
734,"March 5, 2001 2:39PM",escargo,"It's great to be able to argue over such esoteric things as which luxury sedan is best. I agree that they are all outstanding cars, but I had to go with the Mercedes S 430. Although none of them are perfect and my Mercedes has some things I would like changed, its a great car in the classic tradition of Mercedes.

Although everyone seems to think the BMW is the ultimate performance machine, I just did not like its understated exterior appearance and its ""feel every bump in the road"" suspension. I'm more of a luxury and style guy than sheer performance freek.

As for the Lexus, I agree that they have helped ""raise the bar"" in luxury car performance, but something about seeing ""Toyota"" stamped all over component parts under the hood just turned me off. In addition, I am a tall guy and did not seem to have the same head and leg room in the Lexus.

As for the Audi and the Jag, they were not even serious considerations because of reputations for mechanical problems. I admit these reputations may be no longer warranted, but everyone has heard the stories about Jags being in the shop all the time and I have friends who have owned Audis in the past who had frequent problems.

Maybe it's just my low class upbringing, but I can't seem to recall seeing a Saudi prince or a European Monarch riding in a Lexus, but I have seen quite a few in a Mercedes. Need I say more?"
735,"March 5, 2001 3:24PM",wbwynn,"The LS430 has more front headroom, legroom, and overall height than your S430. Check out the specs on Carpoint yourself."
736,"March 5, 2001 3:40PM",escargo,"Thanks for the tip, wbwynn. When I was shopping, I didn't get a chance to see the new LS 430, just the LS 400. If the LS 430 truly has more leg and headroom than the LS 400 I'll have to take another look at it next time, although I'm not sure that alone would change my mind. As for the specs, I'm not sure how they come up with those measurements. I've sometimes discovered that I fit better into a car that supposedly has the same or less room than one which I fit less comfortably into. In particular, Japanese manufacturers seem more inclined to write off tall guys like me."
737,"March 5, 2001 4:55PM",shehzad,"Just about the Saudi Princes-first of all, there's so many princes that it's really not and exaggeration to say they're a dime a dozen. I live very close the Prince Bandar, the Saudi Ambassador to the U.S., who is also a prince, and I've seen him driving an LS400--in addition to some other phenomenal cars that I'll never ever be able to afford. Moreover, if you ever go to Saudi Arabia yourself, lexus's are just as popular over there as Mercedes. I'm not such a bigwig that I know if any of the lexuses I've seen in saudi are driven by princes, but if we accept my premise that there are a lot of saudi princes, and lexuses are like camrys over there, I think it's a fair assumption that some princes drive them. I'm not really much of a lexus guy myself, but just wanted to set the record straight."

741,"March 5, 2001 7:34PM",escargo,I understand that the 7 series Beamer will be redesigned for 2002. Does anybody know what the new model is going to look like? I guess if you're not already on the order waiting list it may be hard to get one for a while after they come out.
742,"March 5, 2001 7:46PM",ljflx,"What do you mean? Are you saying the flagship car or vehicle is the LX470 truck? Or is the flagship the Japanese version of the LS430 which I assume is the Toyota Crown. Regardless I believe Toyota markets the LS430 in America at least, as its flagship car but I could be wrong.

Ejerod - I'm still a lot better off in the market than out of it over a three year period but I'd love to have the past year back.

escargo - LS 430 is more roomy for front passengers but the S-Class should be more roomy in back given the extra 7 inches of car length. LS430, believe it or not, has more trunk room if that would have mattered to you."
743,"March 5, 2001 8:13PM",pablo_l,"...measurements do not tell the entire story. Perceived interior rrom has a lot to do with the way the ergonomics simply fit your very own body. It depends to some degree on the seat adjustment, but then again, some is just layout. Personally, it seems to me the Merc feels the roomiest of the lot, but the XJ takes the cake when it comes to sheer library like coziness. All that is missing is a little fireplace, really. Maybe it's an option in the Vandenplas... :-)
A lot of it also has to do with the color choice of the interior. Perception often is not entirely captured in numbers."
744,"March 5, 2001 8:38PM",escargo,"When I have the seat in my S class all the way back it's almost too far away from the controls for my wide butt, long legs and long arms to reach. I can still sit in the backseat on the driver's side and stretch out with the driver's seat all the way back. That's what I call roominess. I'm willing to give up the trunk space for passenger room.

But I was leasing and just decided that a $140 per month payment differential per month in S-500 over S-430 was not large enough to keep me away from S-500. Though they lease reasonably close in price, an outright purchase is of course quite different. Just curious about your approach."
747,"March 5, 2001 10:04PM",denniswade,"Re your comment that ""something about seeing ""Toyota"" stamped all over component parts under the hood just turned me off."" And why is that, exactly? Anything objective, or just a vague feeling that the Japanese are innately inferior to the Germans? Hell, in the rest of the world, Mercedes are taxis, and a goodly number of them are clattery old diesels. Hardly the stuff of fantasy.

751,"March 6, 2001 5:55AM",drew_,
752,"March 6, 2001 6:39AM",xjs5,"I sound like a nerd but a flagship is the highest sedan. It's like in poker where certain hands beat others. The highest sedan is always at the top.

I should be hauled off to nerd prison but here's an example: Volkswagen lists its own cars from the most prestigous to the least:

Passat
Passat wagon
Jetta
New Bettle
Golf
GTI
Cabrio
EuroVan

Passat is the flagship (with six, high trim level). Passat wagon is next because it says ""Passat."" Any Passat is higher than any Jetta
etc. The second sedan is second. New Bettle is more prestigous than Golf (old bettle before rabbit). Hatchback is after sedan. Generic
designations come before specific ones. Sport comes second. Luxury designation is the exception (since luxury is the goal). Trucks would be last.

Crown is the car (LS is called Toyota Celsior) and
Toyota is the brand. LS is the flagship Lexus but since the same cars are branded Toyota the Toyota is the flagship.

My point was the LS shouldn't be competing with the others but it does- and I guess it was I wouldn't care if it said Toyota."
753,"March 6, 2001 8:47AM",ljflx,The name Crown threw me off. I had read about the ultra-luxurious Celsior in some auto mag a while back. If I remember right it has an extremely soft ride and virtually no interior noise and comes with V-8 or V-12 engines but is only sold in Japan and Asia. If it outdoes the LS as I'm sure it does I doubt that the enthusiasts would like it unless of course it could handle well. But it probably leaves you out of touch with the road - not that I would mind that. I did read somewhere that Lexus was seriouly evaluating bringing the V-12 engine into the U.S. and even toyed with it for the 2001 LS. So it's just a matter of time. Now if they go that far would they put a V-12 in the GS? That would be interesting.
754,"March 6, 2001 8:49AM",escargo,"I must have hit a nerve there, denniswade. In case you missed it, I was merely trying to make the point that at least in the US, Mercedes has for decades been a high end status symbol while Lexus is a Johnny-come-lately. As a young kid growing up in a lower middle class family I always dreamed of owning a Mercedes but never thought it would be possible. There's nothing wrong with Toyotas, I've owned several of them and loved 'em. But I'd never dream of paying 70 grand for a souped up Toyota. That's just my perception, not right or wrong, just how I feel. In another thirty years if Lexus is still around my kids may feel the same way about owning a Lexus as I do about Mercedes. Your attack seemed to be a bit over the top - I'm not sure whose upbringing is more in question.

Ljflx - as for why the S430 instead of the S500, I am a cash buyer and just could not see forking over an extra 10 grand for those 17 extra horses and half a second faster 0-60 time. Also, since I trade in and out of vehicles pretty often, resale value is important and the S430 as the entry model in the S class should hold its resale value slighlty better. Its a tough decision and you can't go wrong either way. If cost is not much of a factor to you but performance is, you may be happier with the S500. Good luck."
755,"March 6, 2001 1:01PM",escargo,"Actually, I believe the S500 has about 27 more horses than the S430. It just didn't seem like enough to me to justify the extra cost. If I were a true performance buff, I would go for the S55. Its not much more in price than a fully dressed S500"

759,"March 7, 2001 4:25PM",pablo_l,"I wonder what will happen when...

(a) Mercedes and BMW bring their (existing) A-class and the newly announced 1-series to the US, which they have stated they'll do
(b) while Lexus stays committed to the uppity market, and strictly uses the Toyota name to go lower in the market
(c) also, VW is about to enter the luxury market with their, what do they call it, D-type or something?

Let's face it, all those traditional perceptions on Old World prestige no longer apply: to start things off, BMW's heritage is in motorcycles and mini-cars in the 50s (the Isetta is not next to any Ferraris in car history books), and Mercedes has been delivering middle class and now with the A-class entry level cars (albeit with style) for a while now.

The only brands that for now truly keep sticking to their heritage are Ferrari, Rolls, Bentley, Morgan, and Porsche (soon to violate it with their SUV, though)..."
760,"March 7, 2001 5:56PM",merc1,"That's true, but as long as those companies still offer the S-Class and 7-Series cars their prestige will stay intact. But you're right, nothing is the same anymore. It's free-for-all now. Everyone wants the sales. However don't forget that BMW's heritage is more in the 2002 and early 3-Series cars that resulted from that. Way more than the econo cars they had to produce to stay alive after the war. I do wish that Mercedes hadn't done the A-Class either, but with it they are becoming a full-scale manufacturer. The big-bucks V-Dub will be the D1. I can't wait to see it, though I do see a conflict with Audi. Time will tell.

762,"March 7, 2001 7:27PM",ljflx,I think it's only U.S. (and I guess Canada) that's hung up on the prestige factor. MB E-Class and BMW 5-series are taxis in much of europe and sell at 50% of price we pay. European consumers pay a 100% luxury tax on these cars which keep them on a price parity with us. Taxi's don't translate to prestige to me. The names Lexus & Infiniti as far as I know don't exist in Japan as brands. We americans seem to have strong egos and these manufacturers take advantage of it.
763,"March 7, 2001 7:39PM",denniswade,"Starting this year, the models formerly sold as Toyotas in Japan will be sold as Lexi -- part of their strategy to internationalize the brand.

As for overlap vs separation, Lexus is gravitating down-market with the IS300 and Toyota is already upmarket with the Land Cruiser and upcoming new Supra. 4Runners have cost mid-thirties for years, which is RX300 territory. Additionally, there may very well be a third brand for the youth and performance market, although rumors of a third sales and service channel have been quashed.

I also agree that Mercedes' attempt to invade the high-production market with the A-class was a major marketing mistake, one that is certain to dilute their premium image if it hasn't already. Fortunately for them, the A-class isn't sold here, where people do NOT associate the name with taxis (although every time I hear one of those friggin diesels start up I can't help but wonder what possessed the owner to buy the thing in the first place). Buying Chrysler was a smart move for them -- managing the merger as poorly as they did, and then buying Mitsu, was not."
764,"March 7, 2001 8:45PM",ljflx,"Toyota is hitting on all cylinders. The last bastion for them was the large sport-ute and the Sequoia is incredibly successful. It wont be long before Lexus has a brand here as well. MB and BMW have a lot of territory to cover both at the low end and in the sport-ute arena. Merc1 may not agree, but the purchase of Chrysler was a brilliant strategic move when viewed from a pure business standpoint. The follow-up execution of the day-to-day running of the business was as brutally bad as the acquisition was brilliant. As I said once before - ""foolish German pride"" ruined a great strategic move. Even now you can see the division in Daimler about how to handle this acquisition. The executive board member of Daimler in charge of MB continues to fight what will ultimately be a losing battle over parts integration and only now has reluctantly agreed to some sharing. Meanwhile Jurgen wants more sharing as it is the only way to save this deal. I hope MB realizes that Lexus introduced a $70k ""ultra lux"" car as a test to see if they could sell a car at that price point. The fact that it is nearly impossible to get one indicates the success they will have in the future. It also means they will probably declare war soon with an LS430, an LS500 and of course an all new ultra-lux V-12 LS600($77k or so). The enthusiasts may not like it and will cry foul over more copying but Toyota will laugh all the way to the bank as the cars are snapped up. It's pretty easy to read the tea leaves."
765,"March 7, 2001 10:42PM",merc1,"In theory yes the Chrysler thing is smart, but I guess I don't see it now because of all the negative press it has brought ever since. The thing I don't like (like that MB exec) is the inevitable sharing of platforms. I really hope it never happens, but I guess it must if this ""marriage"" is to really work. On another note I can see an Lexus LS model with a higher displacement. I would say for about 2003, if not 2002, if for no other reason to combat the reborn 340hp Q45.

766,"March 8, 2001 2:19PM",denniswade,"if Mercedes does not share platforms with Chrysler, the advantages of technical and manufacturing synergy will be lost. Also, if Chrysler is to improve its quality image rapidly, sharing plateforms with Mercedes is the quickest way to do it (provided, of course, the quality is real -- remember the 'M'?)."
767,"March 8, 2001 3:10PM",wie_gehts,"One more thing about prices ... now that the Dollar rose to about 2.20 DM from 1.60 DM two years ago, that means any BMW or Benz sold in the US should be much cheaper. But of course they don't adjust the prices, only if it went the other way, they would, I guess. In this case, however, they pocket the extra money and have a good time. One of the reasons why BMW made such good profits last year while other automakers are in trouble.
BMW has the European delivery program where they say they give it to you at European MSRP, but I doubt they adjusted their exchange rates, or does anyone know more about this? If only there weren't all the troubles with the conversion, I would go buy one in G. in DM get the 16% tax back and ship it to the US.
THis even more holds true for used ones. Used BMW are so overpriced here cause they seem to be in high demand (or maybe its just artifical inflation?). Go to a dealer lot in Europe and you won't belive your eyes at what prices they sell one or two year old BMWs ....

768,"March 8, 2001 3:13PM",wie_gehts,"I do believe it is extremely difficult to build a high-end luxury car in the US with the available labor and parts supplier market.

769,"March 9, 2001 6:00AM",remus26,"wie ghets,

Of course the companies are not going to lower prices if they do not need to. Think about it 1) Companies are in business to make money & maximize profits for stockholders/owners. 2) Benz & BMW sales are going strong so they don't need to lower prices 3) the Luxury car market in the US is still strong today(who knows how long that will last!!!).

On the other post. Let's face it, the big Japanese companies build cars more efficiently and better than anyone. Followed by only the Germans. The American companies still can't build a car like them. Why? It's probably partially due to research, design & engineering as well as not finding a capable labor force. Of course it could also be management. Ultimately anything is possible and a high quality luxury car could be built in the US but it has yet to be done.

Discussing that is about as meaningful as having a heated debate over which color is best, blue or red.

I don't think any of these brands have a quality *problem*. There is circumstancial anecdotal Internet evidence for anything - there's enough people claiming their Lexus experience was a nightmare... but who's to know whether those guys truly ever owned a Lexus.

You can probably guess that I'm a finance guy who's become deeply involved in my company's strategy which, by the way is far removed from the auto business though we have everyone of them as clients.

It's got to be a very emotional thing for some of their execs to share parts with Chrysler and potentially hurt a brand name that's been built so well over such a long period of time. On the other hand they should never have done the deal if it wasn't their intention to do so in the first place. I would have thought they had unanimous agreement in the executive and supervisory boards beforehand. Then again Jurgen is a cowboy who shoots from the hip.

Regardless of how much I love, and as flint350 once wrote have a passion for, the LS430 I do have great respect and came close to going with the S-500. I'd like that platform to stay pure. Maybe MB can create a platform between the c and e (there is a letter d there) that will be shared. My favorite MB style wise at least is the E and it would be nice if it could stay pure as well. Perhaps thats where this will all go - the top two platforms of each luxury group remains pure to itself. By the way I was an accountant and later a CFO and in past 5 years became mainstream strategic planner as well as CFO. It's fun to analyze anyone's strategic moves. Don't get too emotional about MB - they are just trying to remain very competitive and enter the non-luxury segment. I really do believe that the Lexus success coupled with Toyota's downstream cars for mass distribution forced MB to move. Eventually BMW will have no choice either but they are private and can be stubborn about it for a longer time.

The A-class is not sold in North America because it's not designed for this market. MB is not going to sell cheaper cars that the masses can afford since the brand name will lose its exclusivity. This is something that the Germans bosses take great pride in and hence something that they watch very closely. That's why they merged with Chrysler ;-)

FYI, the new generation A-class in 2004 or 2005 may make its way to North America.

The E and C platforms will probably be shared somewhere done the line. Toyota's main cars had nothing to do with Mercedes, nothing at all. They've been selling hundreds of thousands of cars in the U.S for years. Lexus on the other hand yes it had something to do with Mercedes getting more competitive, but there was already a plan to cut costs and build more cars in the early 90's before Lexus got such a hold on the market. After the hit and miss of the 1992 W140 S-Class Mercedes changed strategies. It wasn't all Lexus' doing. Now that Mercedes knows what it's like to sell a million cars worldwide I am worried about some things. I personally would like to see them build the best car they can, and not worry about sales. Oh well. The A-Class didn't come here because it doesn't fit Mercedes' image in the U.S. Mercedes has more confindence in their cars than most so that certainly isn't it. If they didn't have any confidence in the A-Class they would have abandoned it after the moose thing...
And you need more than one model to build another seperate franchise.
On another note I'm surprised you like the looks of the E-Class. It's timeless to me of course. The E that I still get watery-eyed over is the previous W124 model from 1986-1995. Timeless, Classic Mercedes-Benz...pure.

(I have a hard time justifying 60k for a car that's the size of a Camry.) The E also maintains the classic MB grill and style whereas the new S seems to be trying to carve out new ground. I agree with you that Lexus copied MB's style so it is a bit insulting to hear it the other way around on the E-class post earlier.

I don't think the awards you mentioned are for productivity, but rather for excellence and thus quality. But even if it were for productivity -are you referring exclusively to the automotive industry, or is this a blanket statement? I don't know about the automotive industry, but at least in the semiconductor industry, there are international plants out there that hold their own very favorably. Infineon, Matsuhita, Toshiba and all those guys are not chopped liver.

> But I do know that the last I heard, US

Metrics, metrics. If that were the case under every possible metric, it would make no financial sense whatsoever to move plants to Mexico and such. I know you'll reply that a US worker is more productive than a Mexican worker, just that his wage is higher. But if two Mexican workers, for a lower price than one US worker, create the same output, then the Mexican factory is more productive overall. The productivity measure that most industries care about is $ output for every invested $, and if that measure favored US factories, no one one ever consider going elsewhere. So obviously, your blanket statement can't be accurate."

Yes in my opinion the new CL (not the CLK) is the best looking Mercedes of my short lifetime. It is simply gorgeous, and looks nothing like a Mustang. A Mustang has scoupes and such, the CL has nice clean lines, with a roofline to die for. To me the really good looking Mercedes in the recent past were the old 300CE/E320 Coupe, the still current SL and going back further the W126 S-Class, the old 420/560SELs of the time, of course the W124 E-Class from 1986-1995. Timeless. These cars still look great today. You can't say that about too many other companys early 90's and 1980's cars.

Yes Dennis I was talking about the top-of-the-line coupe the CL. The CLK looks good to, but it should have been pillarless like the CL. Now I hear that the next CLK (2004) is supposed to mimic the CL like the new C did the new S, we'll see. The CL's roof and pillarless design is what makes it oh-so good looking.

My logic being that's the group that will come back first - though I made that move when the Nasdaq was at 3000. Since I defer my bonuses every year (we have a rabbi trust deferred comp plan) I have a significant amount in pre-tax which I can move around without tax consequnces which for me made this even more painful as I could have gone into cash and bonds very easily.

However, unless something catastrophic has happened, I doubt that American workers have retured to the bad days of the 70s when labor and management were at each other's throats on a daily basis -- with the inevitable effect on quality and productivity.

809,"March 14, 2001 8:43PM",ljflx,"Infiniti sent me some materials including cds on the new Q in the mail today. I wish I knew how they got my name. Price estimates are in $52-66k range with similar option packages to LS430. Car looks pretty awesome on paper and on disc at least. I remember you saying it wasn't drawing a lot of interest at the Chicago show. Did you look at it at all when you went?

PatHost - sorry that Pablo & I got off the subject at hand."
810,"March 14, 2001 9:46PM",pablo_l,"...love the ad, and the car looks striking. from a quick peek into a mag, the interior is also extremely cushy. Extremely well-executed concept, topped with smart marketing and positioning."
811,"March 14, 2001 11:02PM",merc1,"I didn't look at it in (here) Chicago, but I did in Detroit and I kind of felt sorry for Infiniti. The 3 they had were just sitting there doors closed with no interest. Meanwhile the LS430 you couldn't get in due to the crowd. I agree on paper the car looks to be a class-beater, but the looks and the Infiniti stigma isn't going to let this car reach it's full potential. I'll be waiting to see the first reviews of it. I can't see anyone paying 66K for a Infiniti. But time will tell. If you signed up for any brochures from any car company you're open game, they share lists reguarly.

On another Note the Detroit show is so much better than the Chicago show. Everyone is there...Ferrari, Aston-Martin, Lamborghini. In Chicago these 3 don't have company sponsored stands. A local dealer has a few Ferraris and maybe a Lotus on hand but thats it. I have never seen an Aston-Martin outside of a magazine until January of this year. The Ferrari Barchetta Pinifarina...WOW!!!

812,"March 15, 2001 8:33AM",ljflx,"Make sure you stay within your budget. But I agree all of us can get carried away with too much enthusiasm on a moments notice on just about anything but particularly on cars. It started for me with the Jags in the late 60's. I always preferred them to the Corvette but the vette was within my budget when I opted for a sports car later in the 70's.(by the way I still love the Grand Prix and Monte Carlo from the 70's - what beautifully styled cars they were. I had a wonderful 74 Monte Carlo in sky blue before I moved on to the vette) On Infiniti I think they doomed themselves with the ""clouds"" commercials. Remember that. Meanwhile there was Lexus in front of everyone's eyeballs. This new Q may be their last at bat.

Do you think Audi is the Infiniti of this group? You don't speak much about the A-8. It is a great car but loses value so quickly. When we looked at it my wife felt it was too much of a ""man's"" car and didn't like the noise emanating from the Quattro. After you get used to the quietness of a Lexus LS it is hard to put up with any noise."
813,"March 15, 2001 9:42AM",pablo_l,"...the A8s design is just too basic, I find. Great car and all, but boring. The A6 and A4 somehow seem far more refreshing and original, I'd rather drive either of them than the big A8.

But talking about utter non-appearance - has cadillac ever been mentioned in this group? A guy I know leased their 4 door (is it the Seville?), and I must say it is quirkily nice. I'm not sure why they aren't more popular in the US, given how pathetic roads are (at least in CA)."
814,"March 15, 2001 1:23PM",denniswade,"a wonderful looking car with much better than average handling and a smooth, powerful engine. Unfortunately, the build quality is not up to par and they haven't done much to keep the styling fresh. I actually preferred the previous version -- it seemed edgier and more masculine. The dash treatment is simply and elegant. They just don't hold together well."
815,"March 15, 2001 3:46PM",merc1,"I agree totally. Infiniti's rocks and trees made some wonder what the cars looked, but the majority of buyers said ""oh well"". You're right the new Q is their last time to get into the minds of buyers in this class. When people want to spend big-money they think Mercedes, BMW and Lexus....and maybe Cadillac to a degree. They don't think Infiniti. Don't worry those cars I mentioned in my previous posts are totally out-of-budget, if you know what I mean. For me it started in 1986 with the then-new-for 1986 300E, I won't say what my favorite brand was before that...the room would be shocked. The Audi A8 has been one of favorite cars since it came here. I love the conservative design and the interior. The S8 or the Europe only A8 6.0 W12 model are truly awesome. The A8 has 2 things working against in here. One, is the Audi image, while it is changing, it still isn't up to MB and BMW, especially when people starting spending 60k and up. Two, it's aluminum body I think has kept many away, too expensive to repair. Now the A6 is about as good looking as a 4-door gets, in my opinion and I think the new A4 is going to be a looker too from the European models I've seen in books and on TV. In short Audi is my third favorite luxury car.

M"
816,"March 15, 2001 8:12PM",ljflx,Do I detect your favorite brand came from the eastern sector of the globe. Couldn't be - only the Supra or the Z would have had your interest. Must have been Cadillac or Lincoln. Just kidding merc1 but it is a pleasure to converse with you even though I'm more prone to someday buy a Mercedes than you are a Lexus. I do like that new Lexus SC430. Maybe I should have waited for it for my daily commute. I have a Land Cruiser for the bad weather days anyway. I'm going to test drive the SC when I bring my car in for service. I haven't been behind wheel of a sports car since I sold my 1983 944 in 1991.
817,"March 15, 2001 8:25PM",ljflx,Chrysler!!!

819,"March 16, 2001 2:47AM",xjs5,"For what it's worth, quattro (the trademark is no capitals) does not emit noise lol. Also, there is no movement of the passenger cabin, except a condition called ""driveline wind-up"" at slow speed
which is an arcane phenonmenon that I don't understand . The comparison to infiniti per resalemakes sense. We're talking about volume in the 2,000 range. In comparison to sales however, Audi the company sets records every month for two years. As for the S8, quattro, high speed stability, flat corning, straight line tracking
I'm just guessing it would wipe the floor with the Lexus. merc1's third place evaulation is the convential thinking on the subject and has been for decades but the truth is Audi enthusiasts don't consider Mercedes to be true competition (BMW, that's antoher story...)"
820,"March 16, 2001 5:25AM",ljflx,"We certainly noticed some noise coming from the sides of the car when we test drove the A-8. The sales person told us it was from the quattro. It certainly wasn't constant but seemed to occur when you initially accelerated. Since we never seriously considered the car we never followed up. Given that we had a 98 LS that was extremely quiet it bothered us. I know I didn't imagine it or the sales persons response. What more can I say. I'm certainly not out to bash Audi. I like the car's style and the interior is beautiful. But I definitely agree with merc1 in his assessments of what cars you are ready to pluck down 60k+ on. For me it's MB, BMW or Lexus not necessarily in that order - in this class of course."
821,"March 16, 2001 7:41PM",xjs5,"I guess the cars you are ready to spend money on are the ones money is spent on- and presumably you thought about it before you did it. Emdunds TMV gives you a perfect idea of what you can get for the same money or less. I don't think of Lexus when I think of 60k cars because no Lexus through the year 2000 sold for 60k (2001?). If the LS430 sells for 60k it will have been a single year that Lexus made a car that sold at that price. The Audi S8 sells for between 70 and 80- the L is probably very expensive, too. I must disagree with the list merc1 made in regard to people not thinking about Audi- they think about it and they pay the money and in terms of Cadillac- what you think of when you think ""Cadillac"" is $39,000.
eight cyl. sedans."
822,"March 16, 2001 8:05PM",ljflx,"I actually think in terms of lease payments to be honest. The sub $60k days for the LS car are over unfortunately. It was great while it lasted. The Lexus ultra-lux tops $70k all in and the eventual V-12 will probably reach $80k if not more. Remember also that the Japanese laborers don't average 8+ weeks a year vacation (sometimes I wish I lived in europe where 4 consecutive weeks of vacation are so common) and Japanese interest rates are less than 1%. This helps keep the prices down as well. The fact that a fully loaded LS430 has just about reached price parity with the MB S-430 is telling. One thing that I am glad about is the fact that Lexus allows dealers price flexibility given the difference between dealer invoice and msrp which I am so greatful to Edmund's for posting. MB's narrow price mark-up for dealers leaves them with almost no wiggle room and that's bad for the consumer.

By the way when I looked at the A-8 (long version) it had a $72k sticker but was only $30 per month over an LS430 with a $61k sticker. Audi must have been heavily discounting. The buyout was only $2,500 more and leases were equivalent terms."
823,"March 16, 2001 8:54PM",xjs5,"Subaru re-introduced a six cylindar and raised the price of the jacked up Outback to 32k. This put it within 2k of an A4 2.8q Avant.

The LS400 at low 50's was a bargain. LS430 sticker 61k seems right. I know they have ""European Suspension"" upgrade- I hope it is not $9,000"
824,"March 16, 2001 9:12PM",ljflx,"Believe it or not the euro suspension costs only $100 extra. It makes the $61,130 car which is the most common import a $61,230 car. But the ultra-lux is usually $68k-71k (with or without euro suspension)and is rarely discounted. The $61k car still sells at or very close to sticker but has been discounted up to $2,000 by some dealers if you press them."
825,"March 17, 2001 8:18AM",ljflx,Actually if I remember correctly the ultra-lux has adjustable suspension settings.
826,"March 17, 2001 11:51PM",bigrichz,"Have been doing some test driving and researching the LS 430 and the S class 430. Someone said the the prices are almost comparable. Well, if you think $18,000 is the same, God bless you. I found the LS 430 quieter, more luxurious, (more wood, leather) peppier and just nicer and for just about $18,600 less than the comparable equipped S 430. I bought an LS 430 and am as pleased as can be with my LEXUS purchase."
827,"March 18, 2001 1:26AM",merc1,"I'll never tell, but I will say it was an American brand. You're right, I would probably never buy a Lexus, at least not for myself. I'm also convinced that a German car or any Euro car will never be as quiet as a Japanese car, the Euros are just too skewed towards driving overall, not isolation.

xjs5,

Definitely not Mitsu. I just meant that people don't consider Audi as much as they do Mercedes or BMW. Audi is still afterall feeling its way in this country in the 50K+ market. Of course I would have no problem with 70K for a an Audi because I know I can get that sticker way down compared to a BMW or Mercedes of the same price.

828,"March 18, 2001 9:12AM",mlmullis,"I've been looking at a '97 Mercedes S600 Coupe and was wondering if anybody could give me some advice about this vehicle. It's got 45K miles. Should I stay away (maintenance nightmare?)? How about the S500 Coupe? (less of a nightmare, maintenance wise?) Anybody want to share horror stories? (Positive stories appreciated, too.)
Thanks!
Mark"
829,"March 18, 2001 9:31AM",flint350,"bigrichz, many of us came to the exact same conclusion - and don't find $18k to be insignificant, given what you get for it (or don't get, in this case). Myself and many others were willing to spend it if necessary, it just didn't seem necessary for our needs/tastes. If you haven't already, also visit the Lexus LS board where other like-minded folks hang out."
830,"March 18, 2001 5:13PM",ljflx,"A fully loaded ultra lux LS430 runs around 71k. An S-430 (which has some ultra-lux items)outfitted with a few basic extras like heated seats, a cd player and hid lights gets around 73k. Pretty close. Now you can keep loading the S-430 and probably get to 80k+ but Mercedes usually doesn't do that because common sense would say get an S-500 at that point. Of course if you stay away from the ultra lux your usually in the upper 50's to low 60's in price for the Lexus depending on whether you get the nav/levinson combo. I opted for the LS430 for the same reasons you noted and if it were $10k-15k higher in price I would still have opted for it because for my style and preferences it is the best car. I can't wait to drive it and the lev/nav package increases the enjoyment. Personally I think the LS430 competes more with the S-500 because its engine is closer in power to that model and quite a bit more powerful than the S-430. If you look at it from that vantage point than you are anywhere from $18k - $25k cheaper. What a bargain.

flint350 - did I make these points well. You are super elegant at making them and have done so several times in the past.

Merc1 - never say never. But I do realize you would be committing heresy. Maybe flint350, myself and wbwynn are going to kidnap you sometime and force you to drive an LS430."
831,"March 18, 2001 5:51PM",ljflx,Must have been Mercury. Logical conclusion as it has same first 4 letters of your id and if your like me you probably always preferred a Lincoln to a Cadillac in the 1980's.
832,"March 18, 2001 6:08PM",flint350,"ljflx, you got it right, as I see it - except I think you're closer to the mark saying the LS should be compared to the S500. I priced the new 2001 S430 and it was well over the 73K you mention (that is, if you equip it even nearly as well as the Lexus - the S430 STARTS at $70k without the many ""options"".) You're exactly right that the Lexus is closer to the S500 and there the real money difference becomes obvious."
833,"March 18, 2001 11:42PM",xjs5,"Edmunds TMV for S8 is $71,280. Now merc1, if you can do better, post your results at www.audiworld.com - they'd be glad to hear it lol !"
834,"March 19, 2001 12:23AM",merc1,"Never say never, you're right.......I just might one day drive an LS430 myself just to see what all the hoopla is about it. I haven't driven the LS since 1998. The last Lexus I drove was the IS300 last summer. Nope not Mercury. Merc is short for Mercedes of course.

xjs5,

That probably as good as it's going to get for an S8. The Audi dealer here can't keep them, but the regular short wheelbase A8 is being heavily discounted.

835,"March 19, 2001 8:12AM",flint350,"bigrichz, ljflx - as if you needed further ammo in your decision making, the S Class board is currently discussing the alarming drop in Benz quality as described in a GERMAN magazine. (the link, if interested: http://mbspy.bacosys.be/mbquality.htm) The headline to the article (with photos to match) says: ""The star does not shine anymore. Mercedes, once synonym for top-quality slides into mediocrity with negligent finish""

So this is what you get for that extra $18k! I knew there had to be something. (sorry Benz fans, I just couldn't resist - after all it's on your own board.)"
836,"March 19, 2001 8:16AM",denniswade,"believe it or not, you and I feel the same way about the LS -- or did, although not for all the same reasons. To me, the LS400 was like a very large, sweet-natured woman who also happened to be a helluva cook -- a great wife, but nothing you'd fantasize about, if you get my drift.

When I tested the LS430 and IS300, though, I was actually more impressed with the LS than I was the iS, simply because I expected less of it. The thing handled great, and the interior just made me drool. The styling is another story -- I still think it's ugly, especially the upright grille and goofy headlights. But if I wanted a large luxury car, it would definitely be on my short list."
837,"March 19, 2001 9:09PM",xjs5,"I want to see the mercedes link but it doesn't work on my computer. I want to see an expose
of Mercedes quality- maybe it will work.

merc1,
the days of 10,000 $ discounts on Audi are gone from what I can tell. ...anyone who has not bought an Audi recently might not be aware of
how expensive they have become.

Edmunds TMV for A8 is $59,249 (with no option).
It is not MSRP but it is $4,268. over invoice.
A6 2.8 are getting $2,000 and it goes up from there. The deals on Audis are when they
sit on dealer lots and become two model years old- there are a few you might find in a national search but the picture you're painting of ""heavy discounts"" is from two years ago- trust Edmunds TMV, unfortunately it's right.

I want to see the expose!"
838,"March 19, 2001 9:30PM",pablo_l,...which german magazine is that? The provided link actualy does not work.
839,"March 20, 2001 12:09AM",merc1,"You're right on point with your descriptive notion of the LS430. Wow, I agree totally!

xjs5,

I know. Do you think they'll get to the status of Mercedes of at least trying to charge sticker price without blinking?

840,"March 20, 2001 3:46AM",xjs5,"The other marque that gets MSRP is Saturn. Mercedes and Saturn, no I can't really figure that out.

The link sounds very interesting but it won't work for me."
841,"March 20, 2001 4:55AM",merc1,"I truly feel that Saturn doesn't stick to that policy all the time either. I don't see why anyone would ever pay sticker for a Saturn. I think Saturn's days are numbered..

842,"March 20, 2001 4:58AM",ljflx,"Are you agreeing with denniswade on his great wife comment about the LS400 or his great handling comment about the LS430? If it's the latter than we may have to make you lex1 because the LS 430 rivals or beats an S-class in many other areas.The great wife comment was made about the old model whereas you referred to the LS430 on your answer back.

dennis - youv'e got guts - If I make that type of comment and my wife reads it I'm sleeping in the car for the next month or so.

merc1 - I was appparently getting great discount on an A-8L here in NJ and the car was not on the lot. In December Audi was certainly still discounting heavily. They were even throwing in the ivory white color, 18"" wheels and alcantra interior at a price barely above an LS430 that was over $10K cheaper in msrp and that was before I even started to negotiate price. What do you make of the article on MB? In all honesty the LS430 interior blows away the S-Class. I think the german auto mags are upset about that and the fact that the A-8L interior is also beautiful and of very high quality - certainly well above an S as well."
843,"March 20, 2001 5:17AM",merc1,"Oh I didn't notice that. I was thinking LS430, it doesn't matter though, they're both non-lust cars for me. Are you sure he was talking about his wife? I don't *think* he was. The MB aritcle brings up some tough stuff for Mercedes. Yes their quality has gone down a noticeable degree. The little details is where Mercedes used to shine, but they're cutting back too much now. I still don't think the LS430' interior or the A8's interior ""blows away"" the interior of the S, but I do think they have a somewhat higher level of material quality, but certainly not ""blow away"". That is over stating it.

846,"March 20, 2001 8:29AM",denniswade,"to see what they said, and unfortunately the S-class is not listed (probably too few respondents to allow a statistically relevant sample). However, the next one down the ladder -- the E-class -- is listed as having average reliability for 6 of the 7 years covered (the first, 1992, is listed as ""better than average""). The LS400 is listed as having ""above average"" reliability for all years covered. (There is no ""Far above average"" rating, so ""above average"" is the highest rating you can get)."

848,"March 20, 2001 11:19AM",ljflx,"I agree that ""blows away"" is overdoing it. But either the Audi or LS interiors are nicer places to live. I'm pretty sure that this will drive MB to change. Last year the S interior was better than the previous generation LS. Sometimes its just the latest chess move. But MB is in a pickle because raising prices to cover the costs of the improvements isn't so easy and you unfotunately have to decide if you are going to allow your gross profit per car to suffer. Personally I don't think MB has to improve the interior to hold their marketshare but their image will suffer if they don't."

851,"March 20, 2001 6:26PM",pablo_l,"...they're a matter of taste and style. German cars never have gone for the most sumptuous and cuddly interiors. It's more about ergonomy and somewhat spartan functionality. ""Ve zon't vant deeztrakshun in ze cockpit, schweinehund"" is the philosophy there. But mind you, if you want to spend 11 hours driving on European highways, few interiors will keep you in better shape than Mercedes' or BMW's. And I say that despite my personal bias for Jaguar interiors (I'd go for an Aston Martin or Bentley, but hey...).

I think all of us have sat in LS400s, and I have 2 colleagues with LS430s, and I do not think that the Lexus sets such a clear standard when it comes to the interior, sorry. It is not a fact, it is personal taste and a mere opinion. I for one am not a big fan of the Lexus interior. The SC430 is another story - gorgeous, if a bit overdone, interior. The LS430 is great, no doubt about it, but not untochable. It definitely has its very cheap touches here and there. To claim it is head and shoulders above the S-class is, in my opinion, an overzealous, borderline silly comment. To me, the best interiors in this class are either the Jag's or the MB's."

853,"March 21, 2001 8:18AM",denniswade,"to characterize a subjective opinion about a subjective topic is a little silly too, isn't it? Obviously, there are those who prefer the relative sparseness of a German interior to the sumptuousness of a British, French or Japanese interior -- but that doesn't make their passion about it silly. They just have different criteria than you do.

I've driven Mercedes', BMW's, Jaguar's and Lexus' latest offerings back to back for over 6 years running, and my opinions of the cars' relative merits has not changed in all that time. Mercedes is solid, but cold and uninvolving; BMW is sporty, with a touch of softness in the interior that the Mercedes lacks; Jaguar is very sumptuous but confining, and a little vague in the handling department; and the Lexus is both ergonomically near-perfect and sumptuous at the same time. It also has a level of performance and handling that is rather startling, considering its emphasis on smoothness and comfort.

I've said before that I don't care much for the exterior of the LS430; but the interior is simply a work of art, and supremely comfortable. Call me silly if you must -- but that's my opinion, and it's shared by a lot of other people, including ALL of the magazine editors whose reviews I've read."
854,"March 21, 2001 8:50AM",ljflx,"Perfectly stated! That is the exact way I feel about the LS430 - spectaclar feeling inside due to the luxury interior, extremely quiet with a great sound system, best ride of any car I've ever been in and very fast with far better handling than many of the auto mags would have the non-Lexus driver ever believe or understand. When those rare instances arise where the Lexus can't negotiate a sharp curve as well as the BMW I'll just slow down a bit. That's what I'd do if I had the BMW anyway and besides that's what the person driving in front of me is doing so I wouldn't have a choice in the matter. By the way the car's design - goofy headlight's and all grow on you every day. Now you still have to explain to me how you got away with that wife comment re the LS400."
855,"March 21, 2001 9:26AM",flint350,"I also defend the Lexus interior as being significantly better than the S-Class. Subjective, yes, but based on sound reasoning. As Denniswade says, most of the press agree that this is a strong suit of the Lexus, to the detriment of the S Class. Maybe ""head and shoulders"" just doesn't sound good to you, but I thoroughly believe there is a significant (not subtle) difference. Much of the criticism of the Benz centers on its interior and fit/finish. Its use of cheaper parts and the fact that just bringing it up to similar appointment levels as the LS costs big $$$ in options. Have you seen the prices of the designo upgrade? And what do you really get for that except a prettier interior (closer to Lexus) that you probably should have gotten for your original $80-90K. Sorry, but most Lexus folks are quick to accept where our choice falls ever so slightly behind (the German style handling), but the Benz folks seem not to accept that the S Class seriously lags in some areas - interior is one. Reliability is another. The latest Insurance Institute safety ratings, just issued, are another. I'm not saying the S isn't safe or very good, but the Lexus is rated in the highest category and the S Class isn't. So, to end, I must disagree when you say the Lexus does not set a clear standard in this area. Indeed, this is one of the areas where its advantage is crystal clear. But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong."
856,"March 21, 2001 10:09AM",ljflx,"Mercede's problem is a basic business one.They were forced (merc1 - I know you don't like me saying it but no one will ever convince me otherwise) to lower prices not just because of Lexus but because they were far too expensive relative to the other luxury cars. When they cut prices they cut quality to preserve profit margins. They also put a low mark-up on the dealer invoice price to the msrp so that the car could not be discounted. The cut in quality hurt a lot. Never would I think, let alone say, that the old LS400 was as good a car as the old S-420 or S-500. But Lexus made big moves in the interior design and quality of materials, tightened the ride and yet still made it smoother/quieter and significantly improved handling while introducing a Euro suspension and an expensive ultra model. But the base car price stays flat and the options are very affordable - $6k in options buys you a lot. So now the car to many, including myself, equals or surpasses the vaunted S-500. MB's problem is that it has been so successful in the past and remains the class leader with the highest prices by far - $18k-25k more for an S-500 over an LS430 is absurd. How are they going to maintain that price point or if not that price than the gross profit it brings in the face of stiffening competition the likes of which they have never seen? Plus they have to deal with the Chrysler problems. A tall order!"

But that doesn't mean the LS430 interior is head and shoulders above the S-class interior. Definately the S-class interior and Benz interiors in general have gone slightly down market. This is of course, due to the fact that Mercedes-Benz has realized in recent years that they can't charge whatever they feel for their cars. If any German carmakers interior is close to and/or even better than Lexus' interiors it is Audi's interiors. The A4, A6, TT, & A8 all have truly gorgeous interiors. Even Mercedes-Benz or BMW doesn't have equal interiors.

And as for Jaguar. The current XJ8 has a gorgeous interior, but I suspect that the next generation XJ8 will not have as sumptuous & as elegant a interior as the current one does. Why? Look at the S-Type interior and upcoming X-Type interior. The X-type interior is plasticky with very little wood trim and the S-Type interior is also un-traditionaly Jaguar."

Um, FYI, the S-class has never been tested by the IIHS, and it probably won't since it is so pricey and not exactly selling in large numbers. As such, the above statement about the S-class not being rated in the highest category is moot. The internal MB crash test results (specifically the 40mph offset crashes) of the S-class are excellent though, just as they were for the C-class and E-class (which was categorised in the same segment as the LS430). All of these MB vehicles didn't even crack their windshields during the crashes.

But the car just doesn't hold its value well even though it is so well engineered.

The S-class interior is a good one - but given the price of the car it should be a lot better. It is definitely below the level of either the A-8 or the LS430."
864,"March 21, 2001 9:32PM",pablo_l,"I am not sure why you and some other Lexus defenders are so passive-aggressive at times really. You unabashedly make very strong statements about Merc's S-class, basically trashing it. And I don't even own a Mercedes, so really, it is not because I have some irrational emotional stake riding on the S-class. I just think all of these cars are fabulous, and simply are different manifestations of the luxury sedan concept. As the French would say, ""Vive le difference!"" or something like that. It makes the luxury car world richer to have all these different concepts out there.

And I think *all* of us luxury car owners have to face to a basic reality: *all* brands are increasingly building cars to certain cost and margin targets, as opposed to simply building them to a standard that shies no cost. *All* of these cars have the cheap interior, shared switch-gear or whatever else touch if you look for it. MB and BMW and Lexus and, inceasingly, Jaguar. I for one have no doubt that Jaguar will be increasingly compromising their sumputous interior, it has already visibly started. I can't say my XJS' switches and such were ""better"" than my XJR's, but they certainly were more unique and not shared with anything else. It's a sign of the times, and if you want no compromises, you'll have to increasingly look at the way-over $100k segment.

While we argue about truly infinitessimal differences in subjectively relevant ""interior quality"", go check out a Bentley's interior. All of a sudden, a $200k+ pricetag does not look quite as outrageous, as the quality of the interior is at least 10x better than any of these $70-80k cars, really. No remote comparison.

Let's all really chill and smell the flowers, and stop trying to be missionaries about some specific car-brand. That is all I am trying to say.

I do own a brand new XJR, but you'll never hear me even remotely say it's the best car or anything like that. It simply fit my very personal requirement and taste list better. But I can totally see how people can utterly love their very own personal choice. But if any of these cars were truly measurably better, they would utterly monopolize the market. As a rule, people shopping around in this car segment are not utter idiots falling prey to simplistic brand image messages and buying garbage..."
865,"March 22, 2001 3:04AM",merc1,"I agree with that part about the image being hurt, but I don't agree that Mercedes changed prices of the S, simply because of Lexus, because the S is still thousands more. For an S-Class to cost 18-20K more than a Lexus isn't absurd...the Europeans won't ever be able to match the Japanese dollar for dollar. I could say paying 70K for a Lexus is absurd. The S-Class has always been this or even more expensive. Thing is there was never a car that could compare for less money. So far they maintaing that ""price point"" very well. And the LS430 does not surpass the S500, it may match it but it certainly does not surpass it. A S500 admitedly with options is still above the LS430.

denniswade,

I do think Acura will make the next RL (2003) a real contender in the mid-size catergory, but it will be years and years (if ever) before Acura has an S-Class type of car. And if Infiniti's newest Q45 doesn't do it, they're done.

The MB500 looks like a Taurus from certain angles....who cares!! The owner of an LS430 is not pre-occupied with others perceptions; he's having way too much fun and satisfaction from the ownership experience."
870,"March 22, 2001 1:23PM",arcoates,"Everyone knows I only return when I strongly disagree with something. And this time is that exterior styling does not matter. On a car, that is the aspect that matters the most.

When bringing a new car to market, what part do you think the designers agonize over most? Of course the styling. It has to project the right image, because it is most important. If it's too daring, it will not be bought (i.e. Aztek), but if it is too conservative, it will blend too easily.

I agree that is is not the ONLY thing, but it is probably the most important. If you took a poll, people would say exterior styling is most important. When a car drives by you, you notice the styling. No matter how technologically advanced it is, if it's ugly, you will not take a second look at it. That is the problem the Aztek is having. It is so ugly, that people won't even consider it. Under that ugly duckling skin, it's not a bad vehicle, but people just cannot get past styling.

If a car company disregarded styling and just made their model purely aerodynamic, it would be a fantastic car. Why don't they do it? Because people would not buy it- it would look like a space ship.

To say styling is not a large consideration is ludicrous. Give me an Aztek, and I would sell it. Even if I was in the market for a cross over vehicle. It does not inspire any passion in me, and therefore I would not want to drive it around. ""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"", and ""beauty"" matters a lot~ A.R."
871,"March 22, 2001 1:36PM",denniswade,"I wouldn't buy an S500 or A8 for the styling either. I don't think any of these cars (except perhaps the 7) are particularly creative or passion-inspiring. That's what I miss about the traditional Cadillacs -- they were flamboyant and elegant at the same time. Would that they rediscovered their heritage and stopped sending us plain-brown-wrapper snoozemobiles (the Seville being one notable exception).

As nice as the new S is, I now think I prefer the previous version, and I think the new styling cues look much better on the C-class. I also wish they'd rediscover the elegance of the late-60s 280. Now there was a beautiful car."
872,"March 22, 2001 2:10PM",wbwynn,"NOT that exterior is un-important, I said the comparisons on this board were ""overdone"". Did you know that the exterior shape of the LS has a .25 drag coefficient...leading aerodynamics in class by far. Or maybe the shape helps it to be the quietest in class....virtually eliminating wind noise even at 70 MPH+.

Or maybe that the fit and finish is flawless using new manufacturing tolerances that are TEN times more precise than the industry norm (1/1000th).

I happen to like the new exterior better than the old, and it has a purposeful design and grows on you."
873,"March 22, 2001 4:55PM",ljflx,"From my perspective it is the S-Class prices that have been bashed in recent days not the car. I don't think anyone in his right mind (unless such person got the ultimate lemon - which I would think MB would replace anyway) would say the S-Class was not a great car. What has been discussed is that the cars higher price doesn't bring better value. I know that when I buy a $500 suit I expect better wool and a better drape than I would get on a $375 suit. So why should cars be any different. What I read on this board is that Europeans are not used to being pampered in interior luxury therefore the S doesn't need it. That's a pretty lame excuse given that it is pampered Americans who the cars are being marketed to. The fact that the Lexus beats it in the place where you reside in the car seems to bother many Benzers. I don't know why - it doesn't bother me that the the Benz handles better. If its not that then you read that you are bashing a great car (the S) or defending your purchase (another great car the LS430). I can't imagine anyone who has to defend a car that is priced much lower than another car and yet brings you better things than the other car in the areas that are most important to you. And if a Benz buyer wants to shell out the extra cash he/she doesn't have to defend that either.

I think there is a different problem here for MB though. That being that the purchasers of the LS430 on this board most notably flint350, wbwynn, bigrichz and myself are probably representative of Lexus buyers in general and we are all S-430/500 buyers if Lexus is not around. How does Mercedes ever take us away from Lexus given that none of us buy the heritage/status nonsense? On top of that you have a company with much deeper pockets, lower labor costs and lower borrowing costs than MB turning up the heat and improving the car. No question that MB is still class leader but the lead is shrinking fast."

Does any serious person not think that it is demeaning with faint praise the BMW by saying that the Lexus handles almost as well or that the BMW handling at issue comes into play 5 % of the time? What has been talked about with Mercedes is the decline in fit and finish if not build quality- but if Lexus had to compete
in niche markets based on other criteria than RWD/ luxury sedan/ a limosine for your personal use-
and an experienced driver tested the Lexus against the BMW and the Audi- then we'd have to come to the realization that there is genius for building cars and lots of the available ability Toyota doesn't have. I think Lexus is great for building a high quality/ clean cars

But some thoughts- if you pay ""the extra"" for the Mercedes etc. seems to betray a kind of arrogance
that says that Lexus is ""it""- Lexus beats everyone- Lexus king of the world! It reminds me of the Shakespeare quote ""there is more in heaven an Earth than is dreamt of in your philosophy.""

I have a feeling that if I didn't feel that the Audi with its best suspension (S8 not stock or L) performs better at high speed than any car due to its solidity and the direction stability of quattro and gives up nothing
in terms of ""luxury"" I might think that Lexus was the best and I would think that the rest of Toyotas cars were ""building up to that""- but Toyota's cars are wretched both for suspensions and ergonomics. The flagship shows what Toyota can do - incopetent floating/ torture racks with poor seat design and non telescoping steering wheels and windshields bend on to your forehead they give to ""the masses""- being one of the masses I don't appreciate it- ""we have ways of making you spend money"" . I drove many LS400's and I hope the new car is as well made.
It is not a sure thing that it is- time will tell.
Toyota made the Camry cheap in the 97 generation,
made the recent Avalon so cheap it is painful to look inside one, and the 2000 Corolla sounds like
a chain-saw as the engine shakes the car and occupents at idle. It is not just Mercedes that is making cars cheaper- not at all- so I'd give the LS430 the benefit of the doubt- but having watched what they've done to the Avalon, Camry, and Corolla (turn one on, listen, feel the seat vibrate violently and then talk about Toyota quality if you must), I'm keeping an open mind.
I'd like to hear more about the cars and less about why the decision was the best decision."

I think Lexus has done more to shake up the automotive industry in the last 10 years than anyone has done since Henry Ford started mass production changing the industry forever. But style matters to me as much as content and class. Like I said I own a 99 GS and may purchase the SC430 because they are gorgeous cars and they look like nothing else on the road. There is no mistaking a GS for an E class or a Jaguar S type. There is no mistaking the SC for a CLK or a Porshe. One thing I love is being somewhat unique. IMO the LS430 is a cross between the Avalon and old S class, but so what ? Who cares ? No one's life or livelyhood depends on it except the people who work for Toyota, MB, Jaguar,etc. These are all great cars and to be honest had Lexus been as unique and daring with the LS design as they were with the GS and new SC I would have given them my dead presidents instead of giving them to the Germans.

xjs5 - I, for the life of me, can't understand what you are talking about. I could'nt care less what a professional driver thought about a car. I purchase to suit my needs and test drive the cars I'm interested in beforehand. It's pretty easy to form an opinion after a few test drives. I hardly think Benz buyers are arrogant because of their decisions. I almost bought the S-500 and I'd be pretty mad at anyone who would call me arrogant had I done so. On the other hand I don't have any doubt that Mercedes markets status. I would to if I were them, they've been very successful at it for quite some time now. Lexus, BMW and Audi also market status so no big deal there. As for your Toyota for the masses comment - they'd be out of business if that was the case. I just bought my mother a Camry because it is so reliable. She's coming out of a 93 Camry with 93k miles on it. Never a problem with it. The Camry is pretty well made and much improved since 1993 from my viewpoint. Finally on your BMW comment - I drive 110 miles everyday and never encounter a curve I can't easily negotiate with the LS430. In this day and age roads are engineered without hairpin curves.

It is not arrogant to buy a car- it is arrogant
to think that one bought a Lexus and IN ESSENCE got a Mercedes and saved 15k. If that's true- the Mercedes is cheaper than I thought. The Lexus is
everything the Mercedes is and better for cheaper- except a slight difference in the way it drives is noted. Comparing a RWD luxury tuned Lexus to a RWD luxury tuned Mercedes isn't that different- maybe because Lexus copied so much of Mercedes.

There is a difference between a BMW 7 Series and any Lexus- do you think BMW enthusiasts
are car enthusiasts for nothing?
Yes, Toyota's cars are without ergonomics until you get to the GS. At least there you have a telescoping steering wheel- you can get that on a Jetta. The Camry suspension floats-
the seat is wrong- it's too narrow- it doesn't have enough or the right adjustments- it's holllow, the steering wheel is wrong- it requires the arms to be held up and streched out, the driving position is wrong- the steering wheel is too far away and the seat back has to be too far back to avoid the windshield. Drive an MR2 and sit on the floor with the roof in your forehead if you want to see how much Toyota could care less about it. I didn't say the Camry is unreliable but now that you mention it the Camry suspension has a big time problem going out of alignment and it can't be fixed- I've read 100's of Edmunds posts about it and I've looked at the NHTSA consumer complaints database. This is from the redesign.
All I'm saying is that someone could take a ""my car is better, my car is good enough, what your car does well does not matter"" approach to most of these cars and trash the others- what BMW owners think about Lexus would not be fit to print.

And as for handling, I agree -- unless the differences are enormous, they are unlikely to be noticed in a car of this class. It's a luxury car, fer cryin out loud, not a sports car. And I definitely prefer the feel of the Lexus to the Mercedes. The Mercedes is just not driver friendly, in my opinion -- the BMW and Lexus are.

I didn't find anything special about the Audi and dismissed it very early. I actually wanted to like this car because of the quattro. The Lexus LS430 beats the pants off of the old LS400 model in virtually everyway and the bodybuild is exceptional. If your comments are tied to the old model than we are not talking the same language here. The new model handles much better than the old.

As for your Toyota comments it sounds like you are pretty bitter about them for whatever reason.

Still, I think to say a Mercedes S-class is ""not driver friendly"" is one of those hyper-distorting arguments. I'd be happy as a lark in a Mercedes S-class, and I haven't heard of any ergonomy complaints from owners.

As to handling, the S-class does offer the sports package, and if utter performance is what you're after, they have something called the S55. Nor the Beemer nor the Lex stand up eve remotely to that package when it comes to performance. Fact is that Mercedes does offer far more idividualization of the car than any other brand, which I think a key advantage in this price range. Sure, it'll set you back even more money, but if that's a concern, Mercedes simply does not want your business in some cases. At least not yet.

Given the huge set of options and sub-models, I do think there is little doubt that Mercedes coul be easily labelled by far most driver-friendly. The only caveat is said driver needs to pack about 40 more bills in his wallet. But that's why they call this luxury segment, and if Mercedes can get people to spend more money than they would for other brands, hey - can't blame them. It's market economy at work. Luxury items, even more than others, are never priced on real cost."

pablo -- look in the mirror, friend -- you're the only one here that cannot seem to tolerate any disagreement with your infatuation with Mercedes. Get over it -- these are ALL just personal opinions, and they have no more weight than what anyone chooses to give them. Why does it surprise you that some people feel as strongly about their brand as you do about Mercedes?

As for ""driver friendly,"" what I meant by that was that ALL of the Mercedes I have driven for the last 6 years -- E-class and S-class specifically (haven't driven the SLK, but would love to) -- have had interiors that are hard and visually cold, steering that is nicely weighted but not particularly sharp or intuitive, and a suspension that handles rough pavement extremely well but doesn't appear to have that much ultimate grip compared to the competition (in this case, BMW and Lexus).

Now, it is true that you can tune the car to your liking -- and Mercedes is to be commended for that -- but that will cost you even more than the base car, which already costs many thousands more than the Lexus. So unless you REALLY LOVE THE CAR -- and obviously you do -- the Mercedes is simply not a very good value. To me, the BMW is a different story. It's dynamics are so great and the styling so sublime, I'd probably bite down hard and get one in SPITE of the price premium.

Unlike you, I do not go and say ""the Lexus is a cheap Toyota, feebly diguised as a luxury car, in my opinion."" Opinion or not, I personally don't go for generic statements that the market quite obviously proves wrong every day.

I'll aid your comprehension one more time: Personally, I own a Jaguar. It was a better subjective choice for *me*. I feel no remote need to defend my choice, nor to declare it superior. That is not polite.

You go on and on about ""I am not against Mercedes"", while publicly labeling the S-class driver unfriendly. Sure, everbody is entitled to their personal opinion, but if they express strong opinion, hey - if you can't stand the heat, get out of ther kitchen. Don't make it look like your being oh-so-unfairly attacked. Your posturing defines passive-aggressive."
889,"March 23, 2001 2:27PM",pablo_l,"...I should point out that I don't mean to single you out. Many others, oddly mostly Lexus defenders, seem to fall prey to the same behavioral pattern: they say ""These are all great cars"" while the puppet on their lap says ""Mercedes is overpriced and inferior and basically dumb"", and then wonder why-oh-why some would argue back forcefully against the latter lapses in their argument.

I truly don't care. I just witness a blatant double-standard at work, and point it out. I am neither a Mercedes nor a Lexus enthusiast. And if you want to bash Jaguar as an outdated platform and whatever, be my guest. I don't mind the cars at all. It's the conveniently twisted argument I have an issue with."
890,"March 23, 2001 5:52PM",denniswade,"you consider ""not driver friendly"" such a flame against Mercedes -- perhaps we have a different concept of what that phrase means. I thought I explained what I meant by it. In any case, this argument is neither enlightening nor pleasant.

Have a nice day, pablo. Please continue to share your opinions about cars with us, and keep your opinions about us to yourself."
891,"March 23, 2001 6:13PM",pablo_l,"A car that is not driver friendly just utterly and totally seems to miss each and every design principle. I am for one totally amazed anyone could regard an S-class as ""driver unfriendly"". According to each and every car test I have read, it handles up there with the 7-series, and after just having parked next to one 15 minutes ago, I got to say that the interior is, by any standard, *very* nice. You can prefer another car, and put your own money elsewhere (which I have done), but arguing for it claiming the S-class is ""driver unfriendly"" is simply ridiculous.

This is all an opinion about the S-class."
892,"March 23, 2001 6:32PM",wbwynn,"When I sat in the S500, the interior was just plain disappointing to me, and I knew that I would not part with 80M for this vehicle. Maybe I'm getting old at 48, but I just expected to be overwhelmed...and wasn't.

I took delivery of an LS430 today, and I really love this vehicle (including the exterior!). If not for the LS, I would be in the 500 or the 740...no doubt....because I've owned them before.
I could love an S500 AMG easily, but no more so than that new Silver LS430 in my garage.

I'm very happy and saved $20,000....part of the ""smart"" luxury car segment!"
893,"March 23, 2001 7:19PM",ljflx,No one ever said the S had a disappointing interior in absolute terms. But relevant to its price is a different story. That's all that is being said here. On the other hand people attack the Lexus for being bland and Lexus buyers speak up and say that's nonsense. To you it means we are defending a purchase. That is hardly the case. We are merely refuting a bad statement because it is utterly untrue. The car is very engaged with the road and the only mag that seems to have gotten it right is auto weekly. The fact that it is very quiet and rides great at the same time are its attributes. It exceeds the S in both of those and in interior luxury in my opinion of course.
894,"March 23, 2001 7:55PM",xjs5,"The very concept of luxury is utterly based on making cost irrelevant. The genuine
luxury market does simply not care about cost, merely about perceived value.

Pablo, if this is true, Mercedes is not a participant in the genuine luxury market and no car on this list is a luxury car. Price points of suppliers, cost cutting, and market competition
are what result in buyers questioning the fit and finish of Mercedes and its quality relative to previous Mercedes.

Do you think it is passive aggresive to say:

Many others, oddly mostly Lexus defenders, seem to fall prey to the same
behavioral pattern: they say ""These are all great cars"" while the puppet on their lap says ""Mercedes is overpriced and inferior and
basically dumb"",

Is that passive aggressive? I don't know.

When I think of ""ride"" I think of my teenage neighbor's Nissan.

Am I right? The Lexus and the Mercedes sell at a mutiple of 15x as many units as the Audi?
The Lexus owners are like a gang that go around Edmunds beating up on you if you fail to see the superiority of Lexus? Oh, I see the superiority of Lexus- please don't beat me again lol."
895,"March 23, 2001 7:55PM",pablo_l,"I, for one, did not base my purchase on what magazines said. They ranked the XJR dead last in the ""performance super sedan"" category every time. But based on what I read between the lines, I could sense my personal ranking would be different, simply because I value different stuff higher than the editors did.

Every magazine I have seen rates the dynamic behavior of the LS430 behind Beemer, MB and Audi. Check this very site, or the New York Times Automobile section (which, by the way, I think the most informative, because they simply praise the good aspects of a car, try to come to grips with the design philosophy, and never go for simplistic rankings). Then again, no one buys any of these cars for their lap times around Laguna Seca. But the fact remains that, when it comes to handling prowess, about every editor says the same [quote from New York Times]: "".. I have to acknowledge that after a week in the Lexus on the mountain roads of Santa Barbara County, it was a relief to go back to my own Nissan Maxima, with its tighter, more responsive steering and better road feel. .."" To claim, as if being doen repeatedly here, that the Lexus is ""class best"" in pretty much everything is silly. They'd monopolize the market here.b There is nothing the remotely resembles ""fact"" to buttress such partisan views.

""Relevant to its price"" is relative, too. I, for one, am picky about interiors, and must say I prefer the Mercedes' to the Lexus'. It's because of styling. I find the Lexus a bit too Detroit-like, noveau-epoque Lincoln-like. Nice materials, very comfortable, but subjectively somewhat old. I could say ""I would expect more for the price"", but I simply realize others love it, are more than entitled to their view and personal taste, which is just as valid. I do not try to come up with artificial ""bang for buck"" scales that are fake facts, badly disguised personal preferences that state that *I* find I'd prefer different execution.

And if I have a choice between a $5,000 Brioni suit, and a $6,500 Byblos suit, I'll simply buy the one I like best. Once I have committed myself to a somewhat irrational pricetag, I better get what I simply like *best* and suits *me* personally. It'd be stupid to think the $5k suit is a ""smarter buy"" if I simply like the other suit more. It's not. It is dumb to compromise once you've gone that far.

Sure, car handling is subjective, too. It's great the Lexus dynamic behavior suits you fine, and no one doubts it has a sweet engine, and that its ride is buttery. But you always go the extra step and make those points at the detriment of the other cars' merits. Merits that about every writing so-called expert has already established. And while they might not be as relevant to your choice, it is silly to try to re-define obvious statements.

I don't mind you making your point, of course not. I totally believe you are extremely happy with your car. But why do you have to keep on making value statements about the other cars, particularly some that can be proven wrong easily.

The interior of the S-class is not cheap. That is a ridiculous statement. Every car in here has one or the other cheap touch - it is a general automotive trend, sadly. About the only thing find somewhat cheap about the S-class is the little plastic drawers under the seats (which you never see), and the cup-holders (according to one owner, and cup-holders in car being a US aberration anyway that are ugly no matter what. Whoever tells me their cupholders are sumptuous will see me laugh at them). All cars cut corners."

I read that comment and wonder what on earth she was thinking or how on earth the Times let her write it. To put it in a different perspective it's as if a woman told you she preferred a fake cz over a certified diamond. I don't think anyone took that story seriouly much to the detriment of the NY Times - a paper I couldn't possibly live without.

By the way these are all great cars - no one is hustling you about that. It's you who are reading a double standard into things. What do you expect someone to say that car A is great therefore car B is not. I came damm near close to buying an S - in the end I walked because I didn't believe I was getting my moneys worth. I bought the LS430 because I felt I was getting more than my moneys worth. That's all there is to it.

By the way who ever said the S or Mercedes was dumb? I certainly don't recall reading that at least not about their cars. If you are referring to how they absorbed Chrysler thats a different story. As a businessman with lots of experience in takeovers I'll tell you that how they handled that was as dumb as you can possibly get."

903,"March 24, 2001 10:18PM",pablo_l,"To sum my point of view up after all this unneccessary uproar: I do think the New York Times' article's conclusion ridiculous. It was just to show that ""the motor press"" has no unanimous calls on any of this. And even when they do, follow their ""recommendation"" only if you think your own opinion irrelevant, which would be somewhat sad. But in essence:

(1) I could be happy with any of these cars. They're all utterly top-notch, and it'll merely be individual preference and taste giving the nod.

(2) None of these cars have any blatant weaknesses, or they'd simply not sell at all. They simply offer different value propositions.

(3) If I could own 10 cars, all these brands would be represented in my garage."
904,"March 24, 2001 10:51PM",ljflx,"I think comparing the BMW 7 to the LS430 isn't really appropriate. Both cars are aimed at different parts of the luxury market. The LS430 is aimed at Mercedes space. If there is a battle coming for the 7's space it will come out of Infiniti with the new Q which on paper looks like a remarkable car. I can't understand Audi's marketing of the A8. How can you make real money when you sell 2,000 cars in a market like the U.S. Either go after the market full fledge or get out. They seem to be half baked."
905,"March 25, 2001 9:39AM",pablo_l,"BMW set out to win Merc's market when they came out with the 7-series, they did not create a new, different market. The fact they all have different value propositions does not mean it is entirely different markets."

909,"March 25, 2001 5:41PM",ljflx,I'm not sure if you agree with me or if you are being critical. From what I see Mercedes is in the middle of both Lexus and BMW. Lexus buyers will seriously consider an S but probably not seriouly consider a 7. Why? Because most are not interested in the performance the BMW offers. On the other hand I don't think that BMW buyers are all that interested in an LS430 because they prefer the performance over the plush ride. But they will probably give an S serious consideration. Now don't get me wrong - this doesn't mean that a 7 doesn't ride nice or that an LS430 doesn't handle well. An S rides real nice but below an LS430 while it handles real well but below the 7. And therein probably lies the reasons why people feel their cars selections were the best at least among these three cars. Those who want the handling feel they have the best car in the 7 and those who want the ride feel they have the best car in the LS430. I'm not sure where that leaves the S except that it has the best blend and still commands the most stature. It seems that the car is gravitating more towards the LS430 than the 7 though.

913,"March 25, 2001 9:45PM",pablo_l,"Well, I am one of the Jag guys. But when I got the XJR, I was looking more for a 2+2 GT feel, and the XJR delivers that. people that go for a Lex or S-class think more about ""rear accommodations"", and though the Jag is beautiful inside, it simply can not compete at all when it comes to room in the back. That said, I am pretty confident the XJR is leagues ahead of any of the other cars in this discussion in dynamic behavior. Its magic lies in the fact that, performance wise, only stuff like the M5 or E55 put it in its place, yet luxury feel wise, only this class of cars competes with it in some special way. It's an entirely different category. It might not appeal to many people, but those who buy into the value porposition are very lucky. I know I am. :-)

For all the talk about the Beemer 7-series being a ""sportier"" proposition, I personally feel those days are past. Both S-class and Lexus 430 are simply faster than the somewhat dated 740, whose taut character is more a sign of dated chassis than of performance-orientation.

916,"March 26, 2001 3:57PM",mvargo1,The Jag XJ8 is a different kind of car. Jags are about elegance and grace(and a little brute force if you go with the R). If you need rear seat accomodations buy the L or VDP. I believe the Jag is a much more emotional car than the others. It is one of the few that is designed to look good first and worry about silly things like aerodynamice second. In a world of increasingly similar looking cars. It is nice that there are still one of two brands that stand out.
917,"March 26, 2001 6:04PM",pablo_l,"Totally agree, but I do think the writing is on the wall, and the next XJ8 will go for the same design principles of the other cars here. From spy shots, the car looks like a stretched S-type, pure and simple - kinda inbetween a Merc E-class and S-class. I did buy the XJR because I felt it was one of the last chances to buy an original British luxury car design, with all the little quirks that come along.

I am not a big fan of the L or Van Den Plas. The latter has an awesome interior, but somehow the stretch of the rear somehow takes away from the design, in my humble opinion.

I do like the near 2 + 2 GT car philosophy of the XJR and the regular XJ8."
918,"March 27, 2001 7:28AM",mvargo1,"the L and VDP do look odd and the handling is not as good, but that is the same as any long wheel base car.

pablo1 writes: taut character is more a sign of dated chassis than of performance-orientation.

With all due respect the 7 Series does have a different character than the LS430. It is performance oriented. The above post was upset that the BMW did not ride like a Cadillac. What is modern about that.

Mercedes fans spent 10 years saying the LS400 was nothing but a fake LS400. Now a 7 Series is an inferior Lexus? Is the IS a more modern 3 Series?
My advice is: do not believe that every cookie cutter cuts to the shape of a Lexus or the Mercedes it famously copied- if you do you might end up like the owner above with a car you hate."
921,"March 28, 2001 8:45AM",denniswade,"replying in kind to something you consider absurd is equally absurd.

A taut suspension is not a sign of inferior design -- it's the direct recult of tuning the suspension more for handling than ride, and is something at which BMW excels. Even the vaunted Mercedes has so far been unable to duplicate BMW's wonderful mix of handling and ride. Lexus concentrates more on ride and NVH -- and excels at that.

None of these cars are a fake anything -- they all reflect their creators' attempts to offer the finest luxury car possible in that price category, and they all succeed in some areas to the detriment of others. The BMW probably succeeds best overall, with a wonderful sense of balance, luxury, performance and ride. It also has styling that smokes the competition, in my opinion.

The only thing that seems to stick in some peoples' craw is the similarity of the LS430 styling to the previous generation S-class. That's obviously not something that bothers the people who buy them.."
922,"March 28, 2001 10:44AM",pablo_l,"...how can the 7-series still be regarded as ""performance oriented"" when it is the heaviest car in this group and the slowest from 0-60? If it's sports prowess you want, go for an M5."

With 370HP and the lightest weight (though no lightweight), there is no doubt. But I am still not saying it is a ""better"" car. I am just saying that all in all, the BMW 7-series perception as the ""sports"" option is anchored in history, not in current product reality. Not that the BMW is not a great car.

For the record, the cars tested were:

Mercedes S430 with 4,3L V8, at $78,305
BMW 740iL with 4.4L V8, at $71,070
Jaguar XJ8L with 4.0L V8, at $65,950
Lexus LS430 with 4.3L V8, at $61,171

Those were the models that most closely approximated each other, price-wise. My point was that you can get better performance from all three European cars, but you'll have to pay more for it, thereby increasing the price gap between them and the Lexus. However, if performance is your bag (as it is mine), it would be well worth your while, I'm sure. Glad you like your car!"
931,"March 29, 2001 8:43AM",bwh,"I'm glad this discussion came back to include the 7 series cars. Yesterday we dropped off the 750 for some service. This thread has really spurred my interest in the Lexus. So my wife and I decided to take a close look at one. They did not have the Ultra Lux version availible for a drive, we took the model one step below U.L. I had always argued that I liked the 7 series for its sporting nature and that the Lexus was too soft. Well after an extended drive I recind that arguement. What amazed me was that My 750 has a much smoother and quieter ride than the LS430. The tires on the Lexus registered every bump in the road, and the road noise on the highway was LOUD for a car said to be so luxurious.Honestly, I am not posting this in a attempt to stir the pot. My wife was also amazed at how loud (relatively) the LS was. I told the salesman that I was very much impressed by the way the car drove. It is a huge improvement over the LS400 in my opinion. But there is no way the Lexus has a quieter, smoother ride than my 750. This comparison includes the 750 running on 18"" 50 series front and 45 series performance tires over Minnesotas spring potholes. I also like the BMW interior much better than the Lexus with the MB a distant third. I looked in the passenger foot well and there was an ugly white plastic duct that resembles a dryer vent. The ducts under the seats as well are too exposed and ugly in the LS. The myriad of rear controls on the LS ultra were pretty neat. Getting a massage in back is a cool little perk. What doesn't work for me are the rear seat recliners that reduce legroom as they recline. BMW does this better as well. At 6'3"" I found rear headroom to be thin as well. I am spoiled on the LWB BMW. The NAV system on the Lexus is clearly the best on the market, I really like the voice prompts and the multi color display.

I was VERY impressed with the Lexus, we may arrange a drive in the Ultra Lux. But I think I still prefer the BMW. The 750 is quieter, smoother, more powerful, better looking, and far more spacious. Crappy dealers and too many visits to them have spurred the consideration of the Lexus. I found the role reversal interesting, my conception of the comparison was very different before yesterday.

And BTW the dealer told me the Euro Tuned suspension on the Lexus has been dropped. Is this the case? I would be interested in driving that one as well."
932,"March 29, 2001 1:02PM",denniswade,"says that the Lexus with the sport suspension rides more firmly than the Merc or Jag, but rated it tops for engine, road and wind noise; it tied for first on ride, with Merc. Interestingly, they said the BMW's fit and finish inside and out were bested only by the Lexus -- counter to your impression. And they did say that although the BMW's ride is the stiffest in the group, it never felt harsh. I wonder if the Lexus' tires had anything to do with the impact harshness you experienced.

I imagine that the LWB BMW would have a more supple ride due to the longer wheelbase and greater weight, and would certainly have more legroom. It's a gorgeous car in any case. If BMW had the Lexus customer experience, they'd be unstoppable."
933,"March 29, 2001 1:56PM",bwh,"Yes the tires admittedly did factor in. The Lexus was fitted with Bridgestone Blizzaks. I am still concerned though because I ran Michelin Arctic Alpins all winter on the BMW and never noticed THAT much noise. I also think the double pane windows fitted to the 750 made a substantial difference in wind and road noise intrusion. I don't think the double panes are availible on 740s and I know they are not on the M-B or Lexus.

It wasn't that the fit and finish was poor by any stretch. I just didn't care for the execution of a couple of details.

I agree wholeheartedly on the customer service end. While they were really kissing butt this time around, there was a reason. The last time the car was in for service they put over 300 miles on the car without clearing it with me. The guy that drove it moved in, new radio staitions, and power seat settings in memory. In addition the simple fact that it needs a dealer visit at all, as new as it is, bothers me. This is the trade off I willingly made though when I bought the car. I do wonder about a Euro Tuned suspension on the LS430, was the salesman correct, is it dead?"
934,"March 29, 2001 2:43PM",scottphillip,"I have a 97 750il and am looking to trade on a 2001 LS430. The ultra and ""base"" Lexuses I drove both had fine rides and were very quiet. The dealership did have two sport models on the lot.

Service at my BMW dealership is O.K., but I have to visit too often. The last visit they reversed my power window button. Their loaner cars, if you can get one, are old, dirty VW Jettas."
935,"March 29, 2001 2:55PM",bwh,"Did you notice much/any difference between the two suspensions? I know the Ultra is an air suspension.

Maybe it was the tires. The only problem is that I would have to live with that noise 6 months out of the year. My 750 is pretty quiet on snows.

Fortunately my dealer offers new 323s as loners. The other dealer in town sticks you in a Taurus. Pure purgatory after dropping off a 750."
936,"March 30, 2001 6:04AM",denniswade,"""Service at my BOW dealership is O.K., but I have to visit too often. The last visit they reversed my power window button. Their loner cars, if you can get one, are old, dirty WV Jettas.""

Sounds like you've got a really dim-bulb dealer. I honestly can't imagine a normal BOW (or any other luxury brand) dealer sticking the owner of a 750iL in a Jetty -- that's just pure stupidity.

Brent: The EM Bridge stones on ALL Toyota and nexus products are universally abhorred. I switched to Sumitomos and never looked back -- my wife's Celica is next."
937,"March 30, 2001 6:09AM",denniswade,"I ran spell check on my last post, and it substituted BOW for BMW. Looks like Edmunds' spell check is a dim bulb too! LOL

Oh yeah -- that's ""Jetta"" (not ""Jetty"") in the second paragraph and ""OEM"" tires in the last paragraph (not ""EM""). ""Bridge stones"" was supposed to be one word (not a construction material), and the brand is ""Lexus"" -- not ""nexus"".

959,"May 24, 2001 1:48PM",fenn,"After fading out of serious contention in this class over the last few years, I think that the new 2002 Q45 deserves serious consideration. It is a contender, if not a winner...... It is quiet and comfortable, It is faster than the other cars listed on this board. It has more technology than the other cars in this discussion. And, the fit and finish and quality of materials is excellent. To top it off, it is far less expensive than the competition. Before anybody dismisses this new car, they should drive one. It is quite a car."
960,"May 24, 2001 5:33PM",arcoates,"I agree with you on the new Q. At first, I wrote it off as another Japanese wannabe. Then, when I started to learn about it, I became more interested. 340 hp engine, competent chassis, understated styling and an interior to rival the best. As many know, I am the first to dismiss Japanese cars, but it has gone back to it's more sporting roots (if you can call 3 model years roots) and has come out a fantastic car. I think it deserves serious consideration, but than the LS430 in my opinion.~ A.R."
961,"May 24, 2001 9:54PM",merc1,"I too like the new Q, but I can't get over it's looks. I saw one in white the other day it was just plain ugly. Too long and unbalanced. I must say I really like the interior, engine and features, but the styling will keep it behind in the race. The LS430 is bland, but the Q offends. Plus the new 2002 Altima looks like a minature version. I really want to like this car, but oh well....

M"
962,"May 25, 2001 12:16PM",fenn,"I too had a hard time initially with the new Q's front end, but the looks have grown on me. I now find it quite well executed. It is unique and attractive in its own understated way. It packs so much power, luxury, and amenities in a $50,000 car. It competes favorably (and exceeds in many ways) the 7 series, E class and LS430 at much more $$$."
963,"May 26, 2001 12:18AM",merc1,"That is true, it's a good bargain, but ugh the looks of it............

965,"May 26, 2001 2:57PM",arcoates,"I too hated the looks at first, but someone on my street has one, and seeing it everyday has changed my view of it. Sure, it's no S-Class, 7-Series (have you seen the spy pics of the newest one, my god is that a beautiful car), or the king, Jaguar XJ, but I like it better than the LS and the Audi A8. Now, when you factor is price, amenities and driving dynamics, it is right up there with the 7 and S. I think it is a fantastic addition to this market~ A.R."
966,"May 26, 2001 3:39PM",fenn,"I think the new Q will be acccepted much like the Lexus GS series in the appearance dept. Many people had a hard time with the looks of the GS at first, but it has many admirers now. At least the Q45 is unique and it is not a derivative clone (like the current LS430 and the last generation Q45) By the way, I agree that the Jag XJ is a very pretty car. However, after having spent time behind the wheel of both a current XJ8 and an 2000 XJR. I have to state that I do not care for the relatively cramped driver's quarters and the low seating position. As beautiful as Jaguar XJ's are, I just do not think that the cabin space and seating position compare to the other cars in its class."
967,"May 27, 2001 12:14PM",arcoates,"The Jaguar XJ is a much different car than it's teutonic cousins. I think style over substance takes precedent sometimes. Their ergonomics are pitiful, interior space is dismal for a car that size (the new X-Type has about as big a back seat as an XJ, and a bigger trunk, figure that out), but the way the car is executed in terms of a design standpoint, it has no peers."
968,"May 27, 2001 1:55PM",badtoy,"any day -- based on styling alone.

""Ain't no accountin' fer taste,"" said the old lady as she kissed the cow...."
969,"May 27, 2001 9:17PM",merc1,"Let me ask has anyone see the new Q in black? Black always makes less-attractive cars look better in my opinion. Arcoates stated it best when it comes to Jaguar. They have always put form before function, the Germans do it the other way around. That is why a Jaguar has never been the ""best"" car in a head to head test with it's peers, but that is what capitivates many a buyer into a Jaguar...the simple style of it. However that is changing under Ford's direction they are becoming more and more functional now, and so far they still look like Jaguars. The reports on the X-Type are good so far, but I hope the interior is more Jaguarish than the S-Type, which to me doesn't match the XJ at all.

M"
970,"May 29, 2001 11:40AM",ripinrocket,"Yes, seen a 2002 Q45 in Black exterior at a Infiniti dealer 2 weekends ago. IMO, it looks better in black, but still is unnattractive to my eyes. The chromeless grille and oddly shaped and sized frontal features just don't work.

The Jaguar/Audi rear end knock-off is nice though. But the interior is only so-so. The interior design is nice but the car exudes a overall sense of being cheap-er. The interior materials definately are not up to par with the Lexus LS430. There is alot of fake chrome which really does look fake, even from far away. And the doors don't close with much authority..they feel tinny.

I saw some other colors also on the lot, the Q45 really doesn't look like a $55,000 car in any color.

In the same compound is a Mercedes dealer and I checked out the 2002 C-class. That car has a pretty hideous interior also. Cheap dash materials, cheap feeling switchgear. Only nice part of interior is the wood trim. Nor is the exterior good looking. Couldn't Mercedes have come up with a original rear-end design while still making it look like a Mercedes? The answer is yes, but they didn't. for some reason, the exterior proportions just don't look right.

BTW, I stepped into both the Mercedes dealer at about 5:15 and the Infiniti dealer at about 5:30pm on a Saturday afternoon. The Mercedes showroom had lots of customers buzzing around and a courteous salesperson actually got up from his chair to introduce himself and give us his card. Meanwhile, at the Infiniti dealer, only 1 or 2 customers prowled the showroom floor. Saw about 6 salespeople with their butts parked behind their desks, and none bothered to get up!"
971,"May 29, 2001 2:39PM",fenn,"I found the materials is the base LS430 to be of similar quality to those in the Q45. The upscale fancy Lexus options packages do have finer materials, but they are way over 60k, so you pay for them. I find the interior materials in the new Q to be quite nice. In fact, the plentiful wood trim is quite real and very beautiful. As for ""fake chrome"".....huh? There is a small bezel around the clock and the face of the cassette unit, which appear to be made of real chrome...not much other ""fake chrome"" to speak of"
972,"May 29, 2001 7:05PM",ripinrocket,"tap the face of the cassette unit. It's obviously fake, and so is the bezel around the clock. In fact, most cars that have chrome interior pieces are really not chrome. For example, the chrome grilles today on most cars are really not made out of chrome but are plastic. What I don't like in the Q45 is that the fake chrome looks and feels fake."
973,"May 29, 2001 8:51PM",fenn,"There is always plenty of room to debate aesthetics. I realize that this is not the discusssion board for the Mercedes C class, but I disagree, and think it is a nice looking car. It has true Mercedes character. As for the new Q45, the clock and chrome cassette bezel that you nitpick were cited in one automotive review of the new Q45 as an lovely and elegant touch. They look like real shiny mirror-like chrome to me too. Oh well........"
974,"May 29, 2001 11:41PM",merc1,"Well I have to say that I'm not completely crazy about the new C's interior, my problem is with the seats themselves. They aren't any different whether or not you get full leather or not. The styling on the other hand is simply gorgeous.

I dont care for the rear of the 3 as it looks like a fish from the side. And I'm going to have to say that the new ""planned"" 5-Series if it is going to look as planned will look rather ugly. I prefer the current 5-series design.

The new C is a quantum leap over the previous gen, which I considered a cardboard box.

Audi usually wins the styling kudos in the auto mags, by the way -- not that I give a tinker's you-know-what about what they say (except when they agree with me, of course)."

985,"June 3, 2001 8:31AM",arcoates,"badtoy, I apologize for calling you ignorant. BMW is my favourite brand, and when someone says something as controversial as that, with no proof (as far as mags go), then I get a little hot. Hopefully no harm done~ A.R."
986,"June 3, 2001 9:02AM",fenn,"...a bit of spirited discussion can be fun, however, isn't this discussion group suppossed to be about high end sedans, (not C class vs. BMW 3 series) I am also wondering if the new Q45 can at least get enough respect to be added to the topic title....?"
987,"June 3, 2001 9:08AM",arcoates,"I was just going to pose that question. I have before me the new issue of R&T where they pitted the LS430 against the Q45 and the Q came out on top. That proves it there that the Q has come back with a vengeance and has caught the attention from the auto community. I love it, and I usually detest the young upstarts from Japan. It has a great exterior, a very sumptious interior and the driving dynamics to put the LS and maybe even the S-Class to shame. What do others think?~ A.R."
988,"June 3, 2001 10:33AM",bitkahuna,"The Q will win the reviews, and the LS will take almost all the sales. Go figure.

The reason of course is that the Q is (again) being promoted as a hot rod (see their ads), and the LS buyer isn't very interested in performance and handling - what they're really buying in an LS is what a Cadillac SHOULD be (hey, that's a take off on the Lincoln phrase, isn't it?) - a silent, rock solid, reliable, quite powerful, and luxurious large car that doesn't cost as much as a Mercedes."
989,"June 3, 2001 10:46AM",ripinrocket,"Well, the most recent Motor Trend did a comparo of the Audi A8L, Seville STS, Jaguar XJ8 VP, Lexus LS430, Infiniti Q45, & Mercedes-Benz S-class. The Benz came out on top, and the lexus a second, I would conclude. They liked the Q45, but basically said it had some major flaws."
990,"June 3, 2001 11:09AM",badtoy,"Infiniti actually took on a much more dangerous rival in BMW than Lexus did with Mercedes when they were first introduced -- and they're doing the same today. They hope, I imagine, that they will syphon off some LS430 buyers -- but that's tough too, given the level of performance in the new LS.

I think the new Q interior is really atractive -- but once again, the LS interior has just won a designers award for best new car interior, and eveyone seems to love it.

I'd say they have their work cut out for them. I do hope they make their mark, though, because more choices for all of us is always a good thing.

ar: thanks for the apology. Matter forgotten. =O)"
991,"June 4, 2001 4:22AM",merc1,"Well after looking at it again the newest issue of MT I'm sold that the car is terminally ugly. That small picture on page 67 (bottom right) shows just unbalanced the car is, ugly mudflaps and all. What a styling mess. The Benz, Audi, Jaguar and Cadillac take the styling here, quite easily. The Q's interior is just the oposite, simply georgous. I don't like how only the front section of the steering wheel is wood, whereas the others are wood all the way around, but that's minor of course. My official verdict on the Q: If you can stand the looks of it, buy it"". Another question, where are the 340hp hiding at? I've been waiting on someone to actually test the Jaguar Vanden Plas SC, what a car, XJR performance with the long-wheelbase luxury. Perfect for Jaguar devotees. All the A8 lineup needs now is the W12 motor that is available in Europe. Cadillac did especially good considering it's price and fwd handicap, it posted the best slalom speed, with the least finesse...exactly the point a many have tried to make to the Cadillac fans for the last 2 years. The S430 did good considering it's low hp in this group, and the Lexus performed as expected...the silent/strong type. BMW was suspicious by it's absence. Ah, but at the end of it all it's either the Lexus or the Benz....Mercedes does it again, by the narrowest or margins.

997,"June 4, 2001 9:01AM",bitkahuna,"When the new S-Class came out, I was initially very impressed by the new sleek bodywork and low stance, compared to the 'huge' previous S-class. It's certainly a graceful looking car.

However, now I am beginning to consider it a liability somewhat, because of, believe it or not, the popularity of SUVs. It's hard to believe that the Lincoln Navigator has achieved quite a 'social status' considering it's a Ford truck with and tons of leather without an exposed bed. Why is this? I think it's because people really like the high seating area, the high roof, and the imposing presence of the vehicle, and of course its towing capacity if you have a boat or horse trailer (both also status symbols).

I mention this because some have said the LS430 is too tall, but I think Lexus realized that people LIKE having lots of head room (an ongoing complaint about Japanese cars), and like not having to struggle to get in and out of a vehicle.

What do you think? Does Mercedes have a beautiful design that is in some ways less functional?"
998,"June 4, 2001 9:04AM",ripinrocket,"NOt really, considering the S-class sedans have about as much headroom as the LS430."

1000,"June 4, 2001 12:00PM",carphart,"The Lexus LS430 has set it own mark, although it is pretty unexciting. It is generic and derivative in its looks.

Ironically, the Q45 is priced more in line the the Mercedes E class, and not the S class."

1002,"June 4, 2001 12:14PM",bitkahuna,"[I was about to say that the S-Class seems to be taller than the LS430 from comparing specs on Edmunds, but now looking at Lexus' own web site, it looks like Edmunds has the wrong dimensions for the LS430 (I THINK THEY'VE USED THE IS300 SPECS!!!! - HOSTS????)]

By looking at each manufacturer's respective sites instead, I see that the LS is one inch taller, but 6 inches shorter than the S, which would explain why it 'looks' taller. As far as headroom, you get 1/2 or 2 inches more in the LS depending on whether you get the sunroof (of course most will, so it's only 1/2 inch more headroom).

It's amazing then how much room there is inside an LS430, and it has a bigger trunk than the S (20 vs 15 cu ft)

It's also 1 typical male (180lbs) lighter.

(FYI, just looked at the prior gen. S-Class, and it has 1/2"" more headroom than the new one.)

Interesting side note the only sound system better than the Mark Levinson designed 11 speaker system (according to Moter Trend) was the 300W Bose/Infiniti audio system in the new Q.

Sometimes the Q does not look like a $53,000 car. With the Titanium exterior and the willow/blond wood interior that they had at the NY auto show it looks like an $70,000 one instead.

The Q has been a $50,000 car for years it just is finally worth that.

By the way, I just looked at the Edmund's profiles of those that seem to be bashing it the most, and they seem to be driving Mitsubishis and Hondas....hmm? When I drove a Honda I dreamed of a Mercedes or BMW too. I finally got a 740i a few years ago (although, my wife has a '98 Q45). I think that I am somewhat objective, and I am quite impressed with the new Q45. The more choices that we have in fine automobiles, the better off that we will be. Competition is good.

Did not get R&T yet, but July Motortrend with a comparo of the new Q, Ls430, Vanden Plas, A8, the base S, and the Seville STS arrived last night. The Q held up well, overall, but there were some serious complaints. The reviewers feel that either Nissan got the horsepower wrong or the drivetrain was not right for the engine. Nissan's response was that the testers were pre-production models. MT was going to reserve final comment until it got a production model. MT also said that the instrumentation panel and navigation equipment was difficult to use, a complaint they usually reserve for the Mercedes.

The Mercedes came out on top overall. MT really blasted the Ls430's styling and ride, but praised the luxury, overall performance and stereo. The A8 did very well, as did the Jag.

Interestingly, the STS which was priced almost 30k less than the Jag and 15k less than the cheapest of the other four, did the best time on the skid pad and came close to the top in acceleration and braking distance. MT thought the STS wanted in luxury and ride feel compared to the others but gave it a lot of respect, especially considering the cost."

1021,"June 5, 2001 1:06PM",arcoates,"merc1- I have my issue of the R&T and the new Q comparo. It beat out the LS430 by a good 10 points. They felt is offered as much luxury, better and more distincitve looks and better performance all at a cheaper price. All things I agree with.

I don't think the Q is selling that well because it has a horrible image coming from the previous year. It will build steam as more reviewers tip their hats and people see them around. Let's not forget they have only been out for about a month or two.~ A.R."
1022,"June 5, 2001 1:23PM",ripinrocket,"Donfenn,

Time for you to jump on over to the Q45 topic then, isn't it. As Q45 is not mentioned in the title of this topic!"
1023,"June 5, 2001 1:27PM",carphart,"Despite a few subjective grumblngs, I think that the general verdict on the New Q45 has to be positive. They took a chance with the looks, and that may hurt them with some folks, but it is a distinctive car. It is now a car that Road and Track validates over the LS430, at a price well below that of the competition. That should speak for itself."
1024,"June 5, 2001 1:31PM",carphart,"I do not want to get into their debate, but I think that they need to add the Q45 to the title of this discussion"
1025,"June 5, 2001 1:40PM",ripinrocket,"Yes, the verdict on the 2002 Q45 is very positive, and I would say it's competes very well with the LS430, 740i, S430, for thousands less.

It's styling & lack of trunk space are 2 big negative's. And of course the biggest problem with the new Q45 really isn't about the Q45 but about the Infiniti brand's missteps for the last decade. If Infiniti did a better job on the styling, they would have a real winner on their hands.

Motor Trend says the Q45 is a good car too, just not as good as the other cars in it's class like the A8, S430, & LS430."
1026,"June 5, 2001 2:23PM",carphart,"Ripnrocket, let it suffice to say that your your two big negative points about the New Q45 are not problems to me. In fact, I like the looks, and I did not find the trunk size to be a problem (I do find the trunk on my wife's '98 Q45 to be a sore point, so I have given that aspect of the new car the utmost scrutiny). For my taste, if the perfomance and handling is good, the looks are distinctive, the interior is sumptuous, and the sound system rocks, I would say it is a winner. I am contemplating getting one when the lease is up on my 740i next month. I think that I might enjoy driving a ""dark horse"". I am not so concerned about the past Infiniti mis-steps, as Nissan seems to be bouncing back from mediocrity quite nicely. On the positive side, the service and pampering that my wife gets on her current Infiniti is better than the treatment I get at the BMW dealer. I might also add that Motor Trend is my least favorite among automotive magazines. I relate better to Road and Track and Automobile."
1027,"June 5, 2001 2:26PM",logic1,Still waiting on my R&T. Perhaps the postal service is reading first. Did R&T have the same issues with the Qs horsepower claims as Motortrend?
1028,"June 5, 2001 2:34PM",arcoates,"Well, they quote 340 bhp and 333 lb. ft. of torque. I haven't seen the motor trend comparo, so I don't know if the numbers are the same.

I agree that the styling is no problem. They went distinctive, but not overly. Everything but the front end is none offensive. It flows together nicely. At least it's not a rip off of someone else's design.

As for trunk space, does it matter all that much? 14 cubic feet sounds pretty standard in the class- as long as you can get a couple of sets of golf clubs in, what's the difference?

What I'm more concerned with is how are it's driving dynamics. So far, it sounds pretty good. Better than an S-Class and LS430, so far so good. That's the spec that would get me into a new Q~ A.R."
1029,"June 5, 2001 3:32PM",pat,"We've talked about the Q45 often here, so I added it to the title. I also changed LS400 to the current model, LS430. And I dropped the ""II"" designation from the title since we no longer have a need to stop and start discussions after a certain number of posts.

1030,"June 5, 2001 3:50PM",logic1,"Arcoates:

MT did not hazzard a guess as to the Q's horse power, but suggested their test results were not consistent with Nissan's horsepower claims. MT then went on to qualify their findings by stating the test Q's were both pre-production.

I do not have my MT with me at the office, so I cannot give you the handling data verbatim. As I said above, the Seville STS actually took first place in the skid pad. I want to say the Q was some where in the middle. MT liked the Q's handling, but not as well as the S. Pricewise the Q stacked up pretty well, though all the Japanese and European entries were significantly much higher than the Seville. In fact, even if MT had used a Seville with the sport option, the Seville still would have been 5k less than the Q, and arguably would have done better than the test STS on the skid pad and braking tests."
1031,"June 5, 2001 5:44PM",arcoates,"Nevertheless, I still think the Q is a valid competitor to this market. It has to goods, let's hope that the public agrees~A.R."
1032,"June 5, 2001 5:48PM",arcoates,"As for the STS, I am not surprised. As I've said before, I think the FWD STS would be more fun to drive than the RWD LS430 just because it has been billed as a driving machine and the LS430 a luxury car. This latest test just confirms my belief. At the time I suggested this notion, I was severely critisized. My theories aren't as out there as many believe. Nonetheless, I am proud of the STS for stacking up as well. I read today that the DTS came second in a recent quality survey behind the LS430. It seems that Cadillac's are holding up better these days. I hope they can improve even more, because once they switch th RWD they could become a serious conetender in this market. The Q45 is, the STS very well could be.~ A.R."

So if it's 'billed' as a driving machine or performance car, it is?? Perhaps you're getting swayed a little too much by marketing.

The LS is not marketed as a performance car, but that doesn't mean it's a slouch when you drive it. Yes, it's 'disconnected' and isolated, by design, but its handling and power are more than capable.

The Q is marketed as a performance sedan, but that doesn't mean it is. They're doing it to differentiate it from Lexus, as they did with the original Q (but stopped with the second generation because its performance and handling were actually lame).

The STS has been marketed as a performance sedan also, and of course its FWD limits it, but it's actually surprisingly capable. I've driven one pretty hard on a track at one of those comparison car events.

The magazines also fall for the marketing image-making too, unfortunately. The only way to know for sure is drive the cars, and make up your own mind. Why don't you?

One car not mentioned much in this board is the A8 - when I drove one at that same comparison event on the track I was sorely disappointed, because I *love* the look of the A8 and its GORGEOUS interior, but the handling, throttle response, steering and braking were poor. I'm sure I'd like an S8, but I'm not about to spend that much on a car."
1034,"June 5, 2001 7:44PM",arcoates,"I think you misunderstood me. I meant that the STS is Cadillac's driver's car. That is the way it is marketed yes, but also the way it is designed. Lexus is going more for a vault-like luxury car. So, why shouldn't the STS come out on top (between those two cars)? I got ridiculed when I suggested that before. Anyway, I think GM has done a great job with the Seville considering it is FWD playing in a league of mostly RWDers.~ A.R."
1035,"June 5, 2001 7:54PM",badtoy,"And as capable as the STS is, it is not as capable as the LS. I much prefer the styling of the STS to the LS too, but once again -- that has nothing to do with suspension and handling. In addition, the STS is significantly slower. So as a performance machine, it has its work cut out for it. My hope is that GM will improve performance AND handling -- maybe even make it RWD."
1036,"June 5, 2001 8:37PM",fenn,"The STS is sort of a raw car compared to the other more refined cars, but it is fast and feels quite aggressive. I had a recent test drive in one, and it was a bit thrilling, although the handling feel and torque steer felt just a bit alien to me. The current STS is a pretty car, but it looks dated. I have heard that the next generation will be rear wheel drive. It is hard to believe that GM, with all of its varied resources, will not be able to come up with a total package to eventually compete head to head with the other players in this class. I also cannot believe that Lincoln had not been able to come up with an American built sedan that can compete in this class...Maybe they will just leave this segment to their Jaguar division."

arcoates,

I can't wait to get my issue of Road and Track. I would have bet that they would have picked the Q over the LS, they are performance first, luxury second.

MT keeps things interesting by testing cars of different prices and essentially differently classes, unlike C&D which would never test such a wide cross section of cars. Who knows how much actually cross shopping is going on between the bunch MT just tested. I doubt if anyone is caught up between a XJ SC and the Q45, but there will definitely be some between the LS and Q.

I think it plays well in this group and provides yet another slant of the performance/luxury equation. In my opinion, it's a great looking car. I especially applaud Infiniti for daring to stick with a headlight design that seemingly puts function ahead of form and, IMHO, they did it without upsetting the overall balance of the car.

I think it's too early to make any judgements based on sales. As word of the Q gets out, I hope/expect that the numbers will begin to support the effort Infiniti put into developing the car. Hell, we need more cars like this if for no other reason then to provide real world laboratories for some of the bleeding edge technology that one day may find it's way into the more mainstream and affordable vehicles.

In some ways, I think the title change to this topic is just another small reflection of the positive recognition that the new Q is beginning to generate among the motoring press and the high end buying public."

Oh wait, your Q's value has already taken a nose-dive, so I would have to settle on a 330i!

Just having fun!

Not saying your Q45 sucks, as the old one did, just that the S430, 7-series & LS430 are better at the game they are playing. Definately the 2002 Q45 is much improved and competitive with the LS430 & S430. And I'm pretty sure you'll see it win MT COTY award.

1066,"June 6, 2001 2:25PM",fenn,"Aculex, cars are a big expense. Everybody justifies their investment in their own way. Many of us drive more than 2000 miles a month, and have worked hard, to make a living that enables us to afford the luxury of a nice car. Others just want to have a nice car above anything else, and will devote a big hunk of their income to it. In LA.. I see guys with nice BMW's that are probably sharing small apartments with roommates so that they can afford to make their car payments. I also see young guys that spend a huge percentage of their income to have a tricked out pick-up truck or customized Integra.. In reality they are probably in much keeper $$$ than that guy driving the I class Mercedes....and they are still happy. I was always more conservative than that, but in the end, it's whatever makes you happy!"

1068,"June 6, 2001 5:13PM",carphart,"I know all about car fanatics... Especially in LA.. Cars are like status badges to many people. They define themselves by their vehicles.

By the way, I did see a 2002 Q45 on the street this morning, and it looked pretty cool. As it approached the intersection across from me, the headlights and front end looked pretty awesome. I also must qualify myself, by admitting that I really disliked the front end of this car when I first saw it at the auto show. I now think that it is a distinctive look, and it is not going to be mistaken for any other car.

By contrast I think that the LS430 looks like the last generation of the Mercedes S class, after a careful cross-breeding experiment with a Toyota Avalon. I am not saying that it is an ugly car. However, it is just nothing special from the exterior. Once you put in the upgraded Mark Levinson sound system (to compete with the Infiniti's standard system) and sunroof packages, a relatively basic LS430 ends up being at least 10k more than the Infiniti Q45. (and, I am not even talking about either car outfitted with navigation). Edmunds seems to be saying the same thing in their recently posted Road Test of the LS430, by suggesting that Lexus LS430 buyers might also consider the Q45 for less money.

I am not the rooting section for Infiniti. We already have some of their cheerleaders here. I am just a car fan and prospective luxury car buyer. So, can't we all just agree that Infiniti has re-entered this rarified market of fine cars with the new Q45. Even our ""devil's advocates"" like ripnrocket seem to concede that much.... So, lets move on!"
1069,"June 7, 2001 6:30AM",ripinrocket,"The Q45 has definately moved up many notches on the ladder, but still not up to the head honchos in the class. Infiniti still got a few rungs to go on the ladder, and personally, with their horrendous start, I doubt they will get their anytime soon.

The Lexus, 740il cost more, but they also will hold their value better. That makes up some of that additional money you pay out."
1070,"June 7, 2001 11:22AM",rapro,"I don't know about the States but in Canada Q45 competes in price against 540 and E430 not the S-class and 7 series. Compared to these it's more sometimes much more of a car for the money in almost every category; bigger, faster, safer, nicer interior, more gadgets, more luxurious. 540 with the sports package is probably a better handler and E430 looks better, but that's about all where Q is bested. And very importantly thanks to opinions like ripinrocket's the Q owner feels like a member of a very exclusive club. He doesn't meet 100 of his cousins (usually ridden by little old men) daily like the S-class or 7-series owner does. Q has an aura of exlusivity and sophistication that is unique and completely its own."
1071,"June 7, 2001 11:45AM",ripinrocket,"IN the US, the Q45 also competes pricewise with the 540i and E430. Yes, the Q45 is bigger than the 5-series and E-class but the Q45 has a smaller trunk than the E-class.

The 540i though is faster. And safer, we'll wait for crash test results for that one. The last Q was pathetic in that regard, and the 540i & E430 are at the head of the class in terms of safety. Just because the Q45 has the safety features doesn't make it the safest. The 540i is definately a better handler than the Q45.

Yes, the Q has a aura, if you want to call it that, of exclusivity but it's not for the right reasons!"
1072,"June 7, 2001 11:52AM",arcoates,"Why are you selling the new Q so short ripinrocket? Correct me if I am wrong, but hasn't the new Q been out only a month?

1073,"June 7, 2001 12:50PM",ripinrocket,"If you haven't noticed most new products that jump out of the gate running usually keep running, while most new cars that start out of the gate walking usually end up stalling.

Of course, that doesn't mean the Q45 will be one that keeps on walking but chances are good. Let's face it, it's not getting noticed even though it's had alot of good reviews.

A decade+ of screw-ups by the Infiniti division takes a while to overcome. I suspect, for the Q45 to really get noticed on sales charts will take one more generation. I hope it does well on the market as more competition is always good for the consumer of these products."

I see a lot of young people getting themselves in trouble by leasing a high-end car. I once considered leasing a new 1992 Cadillac Deville but waited two years until I was able to buy a 1994 model. I still have this car today, fully paid and it is still faithfully serving me."

You are that guy who always has to get in the last word. The guy that you try to avoid, or walk away from, at the cocktail party.

You should probably stay home this weekend and put those new white lenses on your Honda tailights. That seems to be the current rage among Honda owners.......Oh, ...you already have them?"

1090,"June 9, 2001 11:15AM",rapro,"Rocketman, do you deny that Q45 is more/a lot more car (to me and others) for the money in its price range? If according to you the Q is close to the 7-series and 7-series by any reasonable account is more of a car then 5-series, it follows that the Q is at least equal to the 5-series despite its small trunk about which you seem so obsessed.

Reasons are personal especially when a car selection is concerned, they are objectively neither wrong nor right contrary to your opinion. My reason that I would prefer Q of all the cars in its price category (5-series, E-clas etc) is because it has an air of exclusivity and sublime sophistication. In other words, to paraphrase one of the Marx brothers, I wouldn't want to belong to a driver club that would have people of your ilk as members. This is perfectly good and ""right"" reason, among others, for me though I would imagine that it wouldn't be to you."
1091,"June 9, 2001 11:45AM",mbaudibest1,"my take

Q45- is a nice car. i've seen 4 or so, actually about the same as number of new LS430s so it's catching on. hopefully it will have staying power. i like the styling from the sides esp, but the back needs a little work, it doesnt strike me as luxurious, unlike the first gen, Q. the front is different, but i like it now. definitely a value leader, since it's more car than a 5 series or E class but priced closely. i think the 5 series has a similar sized trunk too. love the interior esp in either the white and light wood or the black with the gray wood. love the amt of chrome that goes in, it feels special. wish the nice chrome tape player was actually a chrome CD unit instead. havent driven it but handling by most accounts is good comparitively. hope it does good in crash tests. hopefully one day this car will sell as well as the LS430, it has the goods and the price to do so. i think road and track just rated it above the LS430, though price helped out (i think it was close to 10000 cheaper). i think the only features it lacked compared to the ls was the laser cruise (coming soon), massaging rear seats, cooler in the rear armrest, and a little less leg room (though still more than ample).
A8L - great car with superb engineering and the best interior, hands down. great utility of 4wd, and huge trunk. dont know why it doesnt sell as well as it should. styling at first is a tad bland, but there's such nice detailing. great handling and the engine is quiet nice to listen to, though i guess some will say it's louder than the LS430, to me it's sporty.
LS430- proudly bland. i think that's toyota/lexus goal with the car. it has the most comfort features and conveniences than can be imagined. interior is definitely nicer than previous generations, and quantifiably probably has the most wood except the jag. however, the design is too bland, and lexus has carried on the same interior theme for 12 or so years. a change would be good perhaps more brightwork like the infiniti. it still is very funcitonal though. definitely the most reliable with the infiniti its only potential bester.
S class- great design outside, needs better plastic and material quality inside, though the concept is great. love the way the leather wraps around the seats and head restraints. needs more wood on the doors, looks like they took too many lessons from previous lexus cars on how to scrimp on the wood trim , though lexus has greatly improved on this. leaving MB a little spartan by comparison. still the icon of the category. Command needs to go or made much more simpler and DVD would be a better choice.
7 series- by far the best exterior design in the category for years, though the S class finally trumped it. interior has too many buttons and lacks a cohesive clean look. mostly because BMW constantly adds features and needs somewhere to put them!!! definitely the best handling. lots of room. of course it's about to be replaced. like the A8, it aged well. used to be my favorite for a number of years.
XJ8- exterior and interior reflect old world charm, though controls are a bit cheap and plain looking. of course there's not much more remarkable about the car, and it's about to be replaced in a year or two. but i still have bouts of wanting one, sometimes moreso than the other cars even though they may be technically better. it's that hood ornament. of course rationality takes over in the end, and the others ultimately win out."
1092,"June 9, 2001 5:28PM",adob,"Why would Infiniti showcase a tape deck on the Q's center console? Does the majority of people still listen to tapes??? A technologically advanced car with 70's tech front and center....While I'm griping, what’s up with a trunk mounted CD changer in the MB S class?? Put the tape deck in the trunk or glove box and leave the CD were most people need it - easy to access, sheesh!"
1093,"June 9, 2001 7:02PM",arcoates,"I too think it is weird that they showcase the tape deck. They should have deleted the tape deck altogether.

However, I don't agree screens combining nav with climate and audio functions are always bad. The thing I'm amazed at with my GS400 system is how well they traded off real buttons with the screen. ALL major functions still have buttons (driver and passenger temp., audio tuning,seeking,ff/rew/next/prev/etc., air flow, etc.) and regardless of what the screen is displaying (a map, radio stations, what CD is playing, climate setup) all the buttons still function. The screen is only needed for minor rarely used controls except in the case of audio and nav, where you need it to pick a station or CD, or of course pick a destination or 'finger scroll' the map to see another part, etc.

It works really well. With all due respect to BMW's driving wonderfulness, the ergonomics of my neighbor's 540i with nav system are foul."

1109,"June 14, 2001 8:35AM",bitkahuna,"I agree both the COMAND and current BMW systems are bad. Probably designed by 'geeks' who thought it was cool without really trying to find simplicity in use.

I'm concerned the iDrive system will not be good either. They've apparently gone to a single 'big knob' that I believe can be pushed in one of 8 directions to select commands/menus, or can be pushed in, presumably to select things, or rotated, presumably to select a value through a range.

I do have a suggestion to the car companies that are going towards everything on the screen, e.g. nav, stereo, a/c. Why not allow it to be customizable by the user (driver). That way you can have YOUR frequently used buttons there on the display, and not the ones you hardly ever or never use.

When you have a good knowledge of local shortcuts, it is pathetic the system can't really adapt to it and keeps mouthing useless directions until you get very close to your destination. I'd rather have an extra audio-CD slot, really. Navigation systems have a long way to go."
1120,"June 17, 2001 2:18PM",bitkahuna,"If you don't need it, great. But I don't enjoy trying to memorize directions, and as for local shortcuts, my nav system has allowed me to find TONS of ones I never new existed (not by it giving me directions, but by me manually scrolling the map when stopped at a light for example, to see if a local road I've never been on goes anywhere useful. You can also tell systems not to use highways in finding and giving directions.

I agree though that they can be better, but I'm not sure if any nav system would satisfy you."
1121,"June 17, 2001 7:39PM",adob,"I love the Nav systems and my next car will not be without one. Yes they are not perfect yet, but like anything will get better and better. Recently I was visiting relatives in Virginia and had the use of my sisters 2000 Q45 with a CD based unit (bet the new DVD is even better). I sat in her driveway ready to pick-up a friend at the airport, touched the ""Airport"" button, and voice and map got me their effortlessly. Once the pickup was made, we decided for breakfast. Not knowing the area, searched the Nav for a breakfast joint, picked one out a list of 20, 8 minutes later we were grazing. Most include food, ATM's gas stations and hotels - very cool when in a rival gangs territory. Yes, it did provide dumb ways to get to 1 or 2 places during the week, yes the Navs female voice insessantly kept saying ""When safe, pull a U-turn"", but if ignored, it would automatically recalculate the best directions from where you happened to be - eventually it came across the way I wanted to go. Not perfect, but I still remember those yummy pancakes at the Silver Diner...."

I drove it Monday night at Infinit dealer. As last time, they had about 15 Q45's on the lot eating dirt.

Pros:
It is quick to fast.
It's got a very smooth, quiet,and responsive engine. Likewise, the engine works well with transmission. Can't tell you though if it does 0-60 in 5.9 as stated by Infiniti because I'm lousy at telling by seat of the pants dyno.
-The interior styling is nice & unique. Infiniti has nice color combos. Seats are very comfortable and somewhat supportive when cornering.
-The NAV system is pretty easy to use, and overall ergonomics are excellent.
-it's got nice & tight steering without being as tight as a BMW.
-It handles good, but not as good as 18"" wheels would lead you to believe.
-Interior room is good although the swoopy cabin gives a noticeable c-pillar blindspot.

Cons:
-The reverse camera thing is stupid-useless really.
-Some of the interior materials are cheap. and it needs more wood trim. Why is the tape deck way down there??? heeeelllllloooo.
-The ride is not as smooth as I would have expected from a luxury car.
-The exterior styling is downright ugly. Rear end looks like a A6 and Jaguar XK8 cross. Front end looks like a Maxima & Buick cross.
-The trunk is small as the magazines say and the opening is narrow.
-the clock in the center of the dash looks out of place. Everything is digital in the cabin but the clock.
-slamming the doors you can hear some *cheapness* in the car. Same with trunklid.

Overall: Very good car, although it's mission in the class is still confusing. It's billed as a performance sedan but doesn't handle all that well despite 18"" wheels and performance tires. And it's not as luxurious as a S-class or LS430. but it's definately a step in the right direction for Infiniti. Things couldn't have gotten worse from the last Q45."
1124,"June 21, 2001 11:21AM",carphart,"ripnrocket, some good observations, but also some subjective silliness. You seem to have a need to inject negativity towards Infiniti, and diregard the price/value issues.

I do not think that people can disregard the 15k or more difference between this car and the S class.....or the $7000 difference between the Q and a comparable LS430.

I am not a car reveiw hobbyist like ripnrocket. As a real buyer, I do reflect on the value. I may try to extend my 740i lease to wait for the new big Beemer, which promises to be the ultimate leader in this class...but, if I do get a new ""ride"" this year, it will probably be the new Q45. It is a neat car at a good price, and it is somewhat different from the other cars d'jour.

By the way, ripnrocket notes that ""everything is digital in the cabin"" Nope, the instrumeent, cluster is not.

Meanwhile, I am going to stick with my Road and Track reviews."
1125,"June 21, 2001 12:17PM",ripinrocket,"Oh, sorry. I forgot to mention value. Yes, one of the pros is that the Q45 costs about $5K less than a LS430 and about $15K less than a base S430.

Although, it is obvious that big price difference is not swaying many, if anyone, to buy a Q45 over a E-class, 5-series, S-class, LS430, GS-series, or many other cars in the class.

Might as well mention as a *CON*, the expected resale value of a Q45. Over the years, the Q45 has held it's value very poorly compared to Benz & Lexus. So basically if you are going to own it, that $5K difference means almost zilch."
1126,"June 21, 2001 12:18PM",ripinrocket,"About my negativity. I don't see any car out there that is perfect. That means every car has it's cons.

Unless you're leasing (I.E. LS430 may do better than an XJ8L resale-wise but the Jag leases better due to subvention) that's something that people just dont pay close enough attention to.

For my money, the XJ8 is an awfully good buy. Especially as a 2-yr old car.

It is a new design, and by most unbiased accounts, a far better and more competitive vehicle within it's class. Something that is especially true when compared to the aging XJ8. Coupled with the current resurgance of the Infiniti/Nissan brand that is now underway across the board, the Q just might prove to be both a short and long term bargain. Only time will really tell.

BTW, I love the Q's clock. It's a very classy analog touch in this increasingly digital world. Sort of a Rolex awash in a sea of Timex's."

Despite the age of the design, and the forthcoming changes, there is something beautiful and unique about a Jaguar. The V8 feels nice too (I would avoid the older XJ6). If you love the look, and find it comfortable, it might be a wise choice. Since I am a tall person, I find the Jaguar's major negative issue to be the Jag's cabin ergonomics. It has to do with the low roofline and cabin height."
1131,"June 22, 2001 8:21AM",carphart,"By the way, I agree with stebu, having looked at the photos of the new Infiniti G35, the new 2003 QX45 sport SUV, and the new Nissan Altima, I think that Nissan/Infiniti may go from a follower to a leader in the next two years. The new Q may not be a high volume car, but as the flagship of the Infiniti/Nissan stable, with good reviews, it should get attention and will gain it's own following."

1133,"June 22, 2001 9:43AM",ripinrocket,"Donfenn,

Glad to hear you were waiting for it!

The G35 looks good inside and out. That's gonna take on the 3-series, C-class, IS300, A4, in a big way. It won't push the 3-series or C-class over though.

As far as Nissan going from follower to leader, don't bet on it. Toyota's got a new 2002 Camry coming which is 100% better looking than the current Camry and it is rumored to have a big power jump and the 2003 Accord is not to far away either, and I'm sure you can expect about 230-240 bhp out of both Accord & Camry. And a 22 bhp advantage for the Maxima hasn't helped it lead and not follow the Accord & Camry. More than just power is needed, and we have yet to see what the Altima possesses. Besides if anyone has noticed, Nissan/Infiniti's power numbers seem to be overrated or their drivetrain's are zapping power somewhere."
1134,"June 22, 2001 11:22AM",fenn,Ripnrocket..... Hondas and Toyotas are vehicles that you might actually buy! The Honda dealer will give you a good trade in on your current Honda too!

Yeah, right."
1137,"June 22, 2001 11:39AM",stebu,"Sales numbers alone do not a leader make! As I'm sure many of the high end vehicle owners here would attest too. Not to stray to far from the topic heading, but the Maxima has been quite a success to date. Also, I would say that it probably appeals more directly to shoppers who are interested in a VW Passat then a Camry or Accord (i.e. the sportier side of the brain).

At any rate, Infiniti is certainly stepping up to the plate and taking some mighty big swings over the next couple of years. Again, only time will tell if the new Q45 or G35 is a home run or just a major league pop up. But at least Infiniti isn't trying to bunt it's way back into the game."
1138,"June 22, 2001 1:07PM",dado420,"Here's a story:

The BMW 7series is a great car. If you want performance, get this. really get it. Preferrably the 740i Sport.

If you want a full luxury auto you got 2 choices
the LS430 and the S-class Merc. The LS430 is simply ugly but it's gotta alot of qualities that make up for it's ugliness like luxury, quiet, quality, sharp interior and feautres galore. The S-class has got that minus the interior, but it's got more performance and a bigger price-tag and a gorgeous exterior.

The Infiniti Q45 is a wannabe something that we don't know what it wants to be. on the one hand it wants to be a BMW 740i, on the other hand it want's to be a LS430, but in the process it turns into neither and turns into cow dung. Let's see it's as ugly as a Maxima, even looks like one from the front, it's interior is downright a disaster, and even with 340bhp it only does 0-60 in 5 1/5 seconds. Nor is it's handling as great as the 740i or S430 sport even with 18"" wheels & tires. And it doesn't even handle better than the barge called the LS430. The Infiniti Q45 is basically a wannabe BMW-Lexus-Benz for people who can't afford a 740, LS430, S430.

Anyone see pics of the new 7-series in C&D this month? I thought BMW would design a nice looking automobile but it too, looks like cow dung. The current 7-series looks much nicer and I would rather rock that thing with the 2002's engine and drivetrain."
1139,"June 22, 2001 1:34PM",lemko,I saw that picture as well! It looks awful! It barely resembles a BMW anymore. It looks more like a cross between an Audi and a Misubishi Diamante. The current 7 is infinitely more attractive!

and I think it looks great. As usual, they don't do anything radical, just soften the lines and make some performance upgrades (new lights, better aerodynamics etc...) and then beat the pants off of the competition for a few years until the others can catch up. Can you tell I am biased towards BMW?


As for someone who said that the new I35 is going to be a major contender, I think not. Unless they are switching to RWD and have a new handling package, it won't be much for the 3 series, X-Type, A4 or C-Class. It will compete with the Acura Type-S, and that's all. A FWDer from Japan will never truly compete with the europeans. The IS300 is the only thing close because it has RWD, a I6 and a sport tuned suspension.~ A.R."
1141,"June 22, 2001 3:09PM",stebu,"I think what was mentioned was the newly announced North American Infiniti G35, not I35. The G35 will have RWD and a 3.5L 6-cyl. It's based on the XVL concept. In Japan it will be sold as the next generation Skyline. Unfortunately, it looks like Nissan will still only have it's GT-R overseas. But, now sold as it's own model.

BTW, the base A4 is FWD with a 4-cyl, so I suppose it must not compete anywhere"

That looks like another computerized version. It doesn't really have the same body proportions as the blacked out spy photos on the other site.

A.R. the reason only WhatCar has 'em is probably because they were only posted yesterday.

As far as those pics not having the same body proportions as the blacked out spy photos - I'd say it's hard to compare - I didn't think the blacked out spy photo revealed too much. The other images on that GeoCities site were just wishful thinking.

No manual tranny planned A.R. - sorry.

Also, if, as it says, it's quite a bit bigger than the current 7 series, then it's definitely aimed as a highly competent luxo express and not a sports sedan. That will be left to the 5 and upcoming 6 series I presume.

Anyway, exciting car I'm sure. Looks terrific, particularly that back view."
1157,"June 23, 2001 9:33PM",pablo_l,"I just think the Jag XJ8 premise has stood firm in a time when other car vendors have set a standard to allow interior space to balloon up beyond what I think I *really* need in a car. I am 6'1, and have an XJR. Personally, I like the ""cozy"" cabin feel. It is a great 2+2 concept, but admittedly not a big sedan despite its external dimensions. I do appreciate the other concepts, I think all (Beemer, Lex, Merc etc) have great interiors, but the open space also translates into a feeling of being less connected with the car, and detracts from the sport grand tourer experience. That's all.

Jag is seemingly about to go more mainstream and join the others with their new XJ design, and I feel the current XH (especially in XJR guise) will leave a void behind no one else is taking on. Which is why I got myself an '01 XJR. It is a dated conept, some say. To me, it's a timeless car enthusiast statement for those who make the concesion to life with 4 doors after having only had coupes...

I think all the cars mentioned in this topic are phenomenal. But I could only live with the XJ8 personally. And I am not sure I could live with the car that seems to be desitned to replace it. Probably it'd be back to coupe existence (and ideally a Bentley Continental :-)"
1158,"June 24, 2001 4:59AM",pluskin,"What is it about X350 (XJ replacement) that you feel is going to be so much more mainstream? It seems to me that a lot of Jag traditionalists are really down about a car that they have never actually seen, sat in, or heard the actual details of."
1159,"June 24, 2001 6:51AM",arcoates,"Of course the 7 is not going to be offered with a manual. But neither is the current design and it is still a very involving drivers car. Even with this approach, it is still one of the best. It doesn't have the best interior or the best styling, but it is still one of the best. So you can have a distinct car that is a drivers car and still be popular and sell lots of cars. I don't think that BMW is going to soften their cars for the Lexus crowd, I think they will make it just as sporty, with a better interior and nicer styling. With that, it will truly be the Ultimate Machine, let alone the Ultimate Driving Machine~ A.R."
1160,"June 24, 2001 10:45AM",pablo_l,"Preview shots of the X350 abound and at this stage are very consistent: it looks like a stretched S-Type, with the obligatory bubbly cabin to maximize headroom. Not that it ugly, and probably indeed it will sell better than the current, more individualist XJ8, but nevertheless it will bury the concept of different, somewhat endearing quirky Britishness, if you understand what I mean. Engines and all others specs sound great. But just like I, personally, would not buy an S-Type, when it comes to buying a more rational and functional sedan I'd probably look elsewhere, too. The XJ8 offers a very unique value proposition, and if you buy into it, the market offers no other alternative. It'll be somewhat sad to see the Baby Bentley concept go away."
1161,"June 24, 2001 1:47PM",badtoy,"Luv ya -- you really police the site, and for that I thank you. Nothing more unpleasant than people resorting to prepubescent behavior when they're talking about cars.

As for the Q45 -- everyone here knows I'm a Toyota loyalist, but I try to be honest about things (I love ALL cars anyway, and that helps), and I have to reply to the following: ""The Infiniti Q45 is a wannabe something that we don't know what it wants to be. on the one hand it wants to be a BMW 740i, on the other hand it want's to be a LS430, but in the process it turns into neither and turns into cow dung.

The Infiniti Q45 is basically a wannabe BMW-Lexus-Benz for people who can't afford a 740, LS430, S430.""

Whew! Let's review our history a minute. The original Q45 was universally praised in the automotive press for its performance and handling -- especially relative to the LS400. It's only problems were somewhat controversial styling and a dingbat advertising campaign. Bad launch = bad sales. A shame really, but that's the way it is. When the LS and Q were introduced at the Detroit Auto Show, everybody swarmed over the LS but stayed away from the Q like the flu -- this before anybody had a chance to drive it, which tells me it was primarily a styling issue (plue the interior didn't look as luxurious as the LS's).

Now, two generations later, we have thelatest version, and it sure looks like a winner to me in the performance category -- but the front end looks like an anteater (to me), and that may prove problematic once again.

Nissan (and by extension, Infiniti) has had some strange ideas about automotive styling for the last ten years, and it has hurt them more than they're willing to admit.

My prescription? Make the cars beautiful. Stop trying to be edgy or ""with it"" and just make them sleek and beautiful. And don't copy ANYBODY (the LS430 comes immeditately to mind).

Someone mentioned the interior -- matter of taste, of course, but every time I see their ad in the magazines I just drool. I think it's beautiful (as is the LS430's, which recently won Best Interior by the Automotive Interior Designers association).

I notice that most of the 45 baching comes from BMW and Mercedes apologists, by the way. Surprise, surprise.

Oh yeah -- someone also mentioned 5.5 seconds to 60 as being kinda wimpy. Dunno where you were in the 60s, but that's big block Chevelle territoy, dude. Check it out."

Given the fact the new XJ is going to be out late '02/early '03, the fact there's so little out shows that probably Jag itself dreads the idea of following up their workhorse with something that backfires. When you've had a car auch as the XJ *so* long out there, I guess there's no way you can please everybody. I am sure the new XJ will be a phenomenal car.

1176,"June 26, 2001 5:51AM",arcoates,"How can the poster exclaim that the front end of the new 7 is ""barf""? It looks like the front end of a new 3, just a bit wider and more updated. It isn't as radical as the Q's front end, nor the S-Class. It is traditional BMW. I don't see where people's problems are with the projection? It looks like a curvier 7, nothing more. The back end is high- so that's probably a show car thing. As are those space aged back lights. Otherwise, in silhouette, the car is gorgeous~ A.R."

If you think about it, it makes sense. Where does your hand rest when driving? At your side. Not at eye level where the usual climate/stereo/nav controls are. So, put a joystick there. You can rest your hand in it's normal position, look at the big screen and control everything. It IS simple. Now, we'll have to see if they make it easy.

The technology on this car trumps the S-Class by leaps and bounds. I hated the car when I first started seeing spy pics, but have grown to admire it. I think it will look much better, more impressive when seen in person. I think it will be more akin to the old W140, which is what BMW designed it to, not the W220. That is why they were shocked to see the sleek W220. But I do believe the interior materials on this car will also trump the W220. ""This is not your dads BMW"" might be an appropriate term. :-)


Frankly, I think the new BMW continues the typical German Teutonic styling. Mercedes has chosen to soften it's edges more, more like a Japanese auto.


Just my humble opinion, please no rants and raves."

1185,"June 26, 2001 11:30PM",merc1,"Well this segment definitely has a new leader. Not the S, A8 or LS will be able to top this car. The only questions will be the acceptance of the I-drive concept and the styling. The styling of which I *kinda* like. The interior will be a knock-out as far as the materials are concerned, but the I-drive I have some concerns about. It's funny but Mercedes with their W140 set the way for the supreme luxury car with Lexus and now to a lesser extent BMW following it in terms of construction, tall styling and size. But Mercedes unfortunately listened to mainly a bunch of auto writers and other non-owners and abandoned the over-the-top concept of the W140 car, just when Lexus and again to a lesser extent BMW are adopting the more concept. The BMW 760iL will easily be the best luxury car in the world when it arrives. The Mercedes and Lexus will be sent back to the drawing boards for their mid-life facelifts, around 2003 or 2004 for the Benz and 2004 for the Lexus. Now sit back and await Mr Piech's answer to both with new A8 sometime next year. How I wish I were an actual BUYER in this lofty group.

I agree, the 760iL is going to be the best in the world. I'm sure when you actually see the car in person, you will like the styling much better. Pictures always distort the car. For instance, when I saw the X-Type for the first time, I was astonished at how small it really is. I know it is a compact car, but the pics made it look so big. Let's just hope this iDrive is all that it's cracked up to be. Then, BMW will be king of the class~ A.R."
1187,"June 27, 2001 2:24PM",vishnu_da,"I know you guys probably don't have it in the US but the 7 looks a lot like the new Rover 75 which is the most beautiful sedan on the road today both inside and outside.

1188,"June 27, 2001 9:45PM",merc1,"Thanks. Well you know how I feel about Mercedes, BMW and my personal underdog Audi. As long as one of these three have the title ""World's Best"" I'm smitten. Mercedes had it for so long so in a way I was *kinda* glad to see BMW leapfrog Mercedes' 560SEL in 1988 with the 750iL, and it looks like it will happen again for 2002 with the 760iL. Now lets see what Audi will do with the next A8. I know what you mean about the X-Type, because this past January at the Detroit Autoshow I was amazed as to how small the F-Type sports cars was.

vishnu_da,

Actually there is *some* resemblance there. I've seen the Rover 75 on tv (Auto Motor und Sport) a few times. It's one of the different, but good looking cars. It's going to be so refreshing to get Alfa, and Maserati back in this country soon. Imagine Rover and a few other long-gone Euro returning!

1190,"June 28, 2001 6:44PM",pablo_l,"BMWs have great technology. But BMW has never been known for great, timeless designs. In fact, most BMWs do not age gracefully at all. Take a look at an 80s 5-series, for example. The 2002 is a famous car, but a very mediocre design. No one can say it is a ""beautiful"" car. BMW say it themselves: function above all. Great engineering concept, but esthetics are not necessarily BMWs traditional strength, even though they have come a very long way. The new 3-series looks chubby, though, I think it's lost the gracefulness and image of agility it used to have compared to the mid-90s design. And the 7 series has always been quite massive, and seemingly is getting even more so with a back that nearly looks like a hatchback's.

I must truly wonder how most of today's somewhat anonymous designs will age. I don't think it'll be pretty."
1191,"June 28, 2001 7:31PM",arcoates,"I beg to differ. I agree that the 80's 5 series and 7 series are very ugly. But the 80's 3 series, and early 90's 7 and 5 series are timeless designs. When I see an older 5 on the road, I don't think ""Ugly"" at all. I prefer the design of that car to a new Honda Accord or the ES300. Same with the 7 series. I think BMW has realized that to go with their outstanding engineering, they need a design that will be able to live as long as the mechanics of the car will.~ A.R."
1192,"June 28, 2001 10:34PM",pablo_l,"All I am saying is that BMW is not known for great timeless designs. I do think Bemmers are great cars, but I also think they age less gracefully than a Merc or a Jag. Some more than others. I would pick a BMW for many things - brilliant engines, the best shifting transimissions... but not design. They've had a few bigs hits (like the 3-series that came out in '92 or so), but most of them are, while not downright bland, not very innovative, either. To each their own, though. The design of the 5 and 7 series defines over-conservative, avoid-all-surprises. The new 3-series looks too chubby, I think they've killed its former sleek elegance. And the Z3 and Z8 will age very badly. The 8 series could've come out of a big-3 Detroit design studio. The car that estabished BMW was the Isetta, not exactly something that will get million dollar bids in Pebble Beach. BMW simply does not have a great tradition as a sleek design house. They have gotten much better, but for a Euro brand they also crank out very ugly stuff with amazing regularity. (Think Z3, and especially the M Coupe.) With very capable engineering, though."
1193,"June 28, 2001 10:45PM",lemko,"I drive a Cadillac Deville and the 7 Series is the only car that comes close to the length of my car. I think the longer a BMW is the sleeker and more athletic it looks. I think a 7-Series BMW looks a lot trimmer than any Mercedes S-Class and definitely more fleet than an Audi A8. BMWs get stubby-looking as you go down to the 5 and 3 series. The 5-Series looks the best it has ever, but the 3 is forever afflicted with that short, stubby and narrow look. I also can't justify paying $35K+ for a car that is shorter than my girlfriend's old Mercury Tracer. To me, the Z3 roadster is quite ugly and the Z3 coupe is hideous."
1194,"June 29, 2001 7:53AM",stebu,"IMHO, the BMW 3-series is a fine looking sedan and has been for several years. I don't think of it as stubby at all, but rather muscular and sculptured without appearing overdone in the way a Pontiac might be. The Z3 cars are another animal altogether. Purposefully a bit over the top. But, their not necessarily about aging well.

However, I fear the new 7-series may be a bit too derivitive of it's smaller, less expensive siblings. In the ""statement"" segment these cars fall in, I wonder if many are going to be enthralled by the idea that their expensive new 7-series might be mistaken for a 325i or 525i. Plus, the rear on the new 7 is, well... strange. I think it has to do with the trunk. It almost looks like it was taken from a different car and retrofitted in place. Overall, I still like it but, again, I love the 3-series look.

Beyond the exterior, the interior is nice but doesn't have the more luxurious and modern look of the Lexus or Infiniti. The idrive is a bit of a curiosity which I'll have to reserve judgement on until I can actully see it in action. No doubt, the 7 will probably, in the BMW tradition, be a great drivers car. But, it doesn't appear to be a slam dunk winner or, in several key respects, even the class leader when compared to some of the other cars here. I'll take a 330i or IS300 (or the G35 when and if it arrives with a manual)... and the change please."

1197,"June 29, 2001 12:50PM",pablo_l,"That link doesn't seem to exist...? Rumours about BMW being acquired have always floated around in Germany. But the Quandt family will never sell their majority share. They are fiercely proud about it, and it would not make much financial sense for them anyway for many reasons (German tax laws for estates being one of them, major family ownership in corporations gets perpetuated forever). BMW is a company that defines core competence: they know how to do that, fine BMW cars and somewhat quirky yet brilliant motorcycles. They screw up everything else they touch, including cars that somehow do not comply with BMW's core philosophy. You will see how they bury Rolls Royce when they attempt to take it over. Considering that corporate genetic code, it is amazing they've remained a successful corporation for as long as they have. Typically companies with narrow core competencies do not stay successful for as long.

Don't get me wrong, I am and have always been an admirer of BMW. It has an unmistakable corporate identity, and it is totally committed to it. When it tries to do something else, it's ultimately repealed as a distraction from what they *really* want to be doing well. It is a major liability from an investor's point of view in the long term, but product-wise it results in excellence for the time being."
1198,"June 29, 2001 1:06PM",pablo_l,"...is up and running in German under www.bmw.de, pic to the right saying ""Vorfreude, der neue 7er."" Plenty of interior and external pics. I think the car looks somewhat chubby, yet in this world of homogenous, ananymous cars, I think the new 7 series has more identity than several other luxury cars. Not the best looking, but most certainly not the worst looking of the group, and if you like a more muscular, squatty look (which personally I don't, I'd buy a new Mini Cooper for that, to me luxury cars ought to be more about sleekness, and commit themselves more to form over function. Leave function over form to the lower car segments.) this might be perfect.

The interior is very nice indeed. Might set a class standard. The steering wheel is waaaaay too busy, though. I already dislike the tendency to have volume and cruise control buttons integrated into the steering wheel. This goes way beyond it. I want to drive a car, no feel like I am in a friggin' Boeing 747 cockpit. Car manufacturers need to reconsider this trend a little, I think. Or maybe it's me? Do you guys like this inflation of at-your-fingetips bloated electronic functionality? Are you truly constantly fiddling with stereo controls and such? To me, it is intrusive. The steering wheel ought to be a somewhat sacred point of contact, as far as I am concerned, leave all the electronic gizmos out of it."

The X5 may not be a true SUV, but it was never intended to be. BMW themselves admits that and calls it a SAV. It reigns supreme in the crossover category. And the wagon is the best, if you want a RWD sports sedan with some more utility. I think BMW is going to do wonders with RR. Have you seen the projections for the new RR sedan? They are were in the last R&T I think. It looks very much like a RR, and nothing like a german sedan. BMW has the midas touch~ A.R."
1201,"June 29, 2001 8:53PM",pablo_l,"...you know I have tons of respect for your opinions. I worded things a bit more extremely than they really are for the sake of argument, of course. But look at the core of your argument, with, for example, the X5 or the wagon. They had to redefine both sgment to fit their own touch to it, which gives them a solid niche for those who like the BMW philosophy by extending it to other segments... but they do not fit smack into the mainstream of the SUV or the wagon market. They don't want to, and they wouldn't know how if they tried. And they do have a tendency to overengineer the hell out of stuff they don't quite understand. The new Mini is a case in point: potentially great (I *love* the design, execution and philosophy) but a finacial disaster for them. They admit they're gonna build the Mini at a loss for years. Rover again...

And as to RR... we'll have to see. I have been in a RR with a BMW 12-cyl engine, and found the car noisy and wheezy. I am not sure BMW engines are intended for *heavy* cars. They should have retuned ot far more. The old 6-liter 8-cyls with huge gobs of torque seem to work better in a humongous Rolls... but we'll have to give the alliance time. The potential is there, since Rolls -unlike Rover- can benefit from a company philisophy committed to over-engineering times at stuff. They can and should go bananas on RR."

Nothing matches the feeling, provided your DNA predisposes you to heavy machinery and you have an appreciation for fine artisan craftmanship.

I have my name already on a list for the new Mid-Sized Bentley. I am no where near being able to afford the current large Bentley at over 210k. But the new MSB Bentley is targeted at about 150k, which suits my wallet much more.

The MSB will first appear as a coupe, and the front seems similar to the MB CL, though more elegant."
1210,"June 30, 2001 3:07PM",is4b2rd,"I can't believe my good fortune. I was called by a research company to evaluate 3 automobiles. I had an inkling that it might be the new BMW. :-)

The three cars were Lexus LS430, MB S430 and the BMW 745i.

I have to say right off, the car looks much better in person than it does in photos. Though the trunklid still looks just a bit awkward, it definitely looks better in person.

I will try to recall all the details that I can.

The headlamps are bi-xenon and have the ""halo"" effect like the 2001 5-series. VERY cool.

The 745i bases at 71,650. Which is significantly more than the current 7-series. That includes the usual stuff, including an ""active"" type suspension. The car they had there was FULLY loaded. Had auto door closers, the trunk was auto open and close and was a sight to behold. I DEFINITELY would want that. It is just amazing to watch.

The best way I can describe the interior is that it is like sitting in a living room full of Italian furniture. With this interior, BMW has definitely taken a high-tech path to luxury. It definitely has a luxurious feel, but if you think of Italian furniture, sleek, VERY modern, you will know what I am talking about. I think BLACK will be the best color for this interior.

Also, the standard wood has a matte finish. I would definitely upgrade to the shiny stuff. The matte is ok, but doesn't look as rich as shiny wood.

The seats are fantastic! Think of sitting in a catchers mitt, all snug and cozy. That's exactly the way it felt. The seats are just awesome, and the controls for them, which are on the side of the center console are unique. There is a rotary control and you turn it either way after selecting the portion of the seat control that you want to change. Very unique, and very effective. Of course it had the heating and cooling seats.

ANOTHER COOL feature is the rear window shades. THEY ARE ELECTRIC!! There are controls on either rear door that control the rear quarter window shade of the rear door shade. They can also be controlled from the front seat. The center console is HUGE! VERY wide, but again, very elegant in a high-tech way. When you open up the two center ""armrests"", it is cavernous inside. A definite improvement over my 740's armrest storage, which is non-existent. :-)

The i-Drive is FANTASTIC! It is the most amazing thing I've ever tried. Also, the center hood, which I complained about in the past as looking stupid. Well, guess what, in person it looks REALLY good. It blends in surprisingly well, and doesn't look like an add-on, which is the way it looks in the pics to me.

The rear seat passengers have a drop down mirror, like the Mercedes, except that there is only 1 and it is in the center. The other feeling that strikes me about the interior, is it is very much like a cockpit, especially with the brushed chrome overhead console.

The rear seat legroom has NOT improved on this i model. I thought maybe it would be, but with the frontseat set comfortably for a six footer, the knee room is still about the same, maybe just a tiny bit more than the current 740i.

The rear seats were also VERY comfortable, but again, it is like sitting in really comfortable leather furniture. You sit IN to the seat, not on them. It would DEFINITELY be my choice for a long-distance drive.

This car so out-classes the Mercedes S-Class, it is unbelievable, and I was a Mercedes faithful for years."
1211,"July 1, 2001 7:47PM",arcoates,"How did you get that opportunity? Do you work in the auto business, or know someone? I doubt they call up random people to review the next super-luxury car of the world! If you in fact did sit in the 745i, tell us some more about the iDrive. Did you use it at all? Is it intuitive, or did it take awhile to figure out how to control the functions? That will be the most important piece of equipment for the public. Give us some more details, you lucky dog~ A.R."

Yes, the i-Drive was intuitive, to me. If anyone is techno-phobic, they might have a problem with the idea, but the execution is brilliant. Of course I wasn't able to use it while driving so can't say for sure if it will be a distraction, but the display is somewhat in your line of sight and as I've said before, once you commit to memory which way to push the ""button"" it will be simple to use.

arcoates,

I would agree that the Arnage Red Label is an awesome car, but I can't quite say its the best. But given the proper finances, it would be in the same garage with all the German iron.

Since there seems to be some doubt on is4b2rd's review of the 745i, I'll not comment on it. I will say though I too expect it to be the best in the world with Mercedes, Audi (new A8) and Lexus to start answering the challenge for 2003 and 2004.

I do think Bemmers are great cars, but I also think they age less gracefully than a Merc or a Jag. They've had a few bigs hits (like the 3-series that came out in '92 or so), but most of them are, while not downright bland, not very innovative, either.""

The 507 (correct me if I got the nubmers wrong, it's been awhile) was one of the most beautiful cars to come out of the late 50s; the late-60s CSi was also a high-water mark in European sedans; and the 633/635 series of the late 70s and early 80s was sublime. The 850 of the early 90s was the last BMW I truly lusted after, and I keep waiting for them to repeat it. All it needed was a drivetrain to match the looks.

1223,"July 4, 2001 12:36PM",pablo_l,"First of all, all respect for your opinion, which of course is just as valid as mine.

All in all, we all know there are no absolutes when it comes to taste, that is for sure, and I am not making a generic claim on this. I, humbly and personally, just have the impression that, when talking about all time classics in automotive design history, Ferrari, Bugatti, Mercedes, Aston Martin, Bentley and Rolls pop up to mind, and BMW does not. When I look at http://www.bmw.com/bmwe/pulse/heritage/klassiker/index.html , I truly don't see something that, if I were a million dollar car collector, would truly make me go crazy. The 3/15 is only remarkable for its simplicity. The 328 steals French design cues from the time. The 502 is entirely unremarkable. The Isetta goes back to very basic technology. The 507 liberally steals Italian design cues (Ferrari, Maserati) from the time. The 1500 is what made BMW a great brand: remarkable engineering savvy in a sporty, cost-efficient package, with the emphasis certainly not being on design, again. And the M1, let's admit it, is a rather forgettable supercar. The 8-series is a wonderfully competent GT, but again, I think the design is not ageing all that well.

I do overstate the point for the sake of the argument, but I think you can sense where I come from: no doubt BMW is a great car brand. But what makes them great is not necessarily design - different brands are made great by different strengths: Ferrari is performance and design, Mercedes competence and elegance, Rolls luxurious oppulence... and BMW is about competent technology. They've been upwardly mobile throughout their history, but I don't think they've yet build a super-car that made the world stand still just by standing there and being looked at. You got to sit behind the wheel of a BMW to appreciate their core competence."
1224,"July 4, 2001 3:30PM",is4b2rd,"The electric sunshades that I was referring to on the new 745i are the rear door shades, for the main window and the quarter windows. BMW is first to market with this cool feature and I am sure others will follow suit quickly. I think it is a great feature because there have been times while driving that I would have liked to lower the shades on the passenger side window, but it is a bit of a stretch. Having electric control makes it much easier."
1225,"July 4, 2001 5:40PM",bitkahuna,"What about the Z8? I think its design is fabulous and will age well, although the guage pod in the center of the dash was a huge mistake."
1226,"July 4, 2001 7:53PM",arcoates,"The Cadillac Catera had a rear sunshade in 1997, and that is by no means a great car. So let's not make it out as if BMW stole ideas from it's competitors, and it's nothing but a copy cat. BMW had electric trunk closers on the previous 7 series models. But, to make it in this market, a company must offer what thier competitors offer. But there is a fine line between adding equipment packages and copying the entire car~ A.R."

1230,"July 6, 2001 7:53PM",badtoy,"Thank you for your thoughtful and courteous response -- it's refreshing!

I disagree with you about several points, however. The 507 is considered by every automotive historian I've ever read as being a seminal car, and I fail to see which Ferrari or Maserati it ""stole"" from.

Design cues tend to come in bunches, as the stylists learn from each other -- and the Italian designers are no exception. Ferrari has had several major designers, although Pinifarina has been their perennial favorite, and they can take no credit for something they did not create themselves.

As for unique contributions to automotive styling, the BMW c-pillar treatment is recognized world-wide as beautiful and unique, and it is a feature of the marque that continues to this day.
They have also had a wonderful feel for proportion and sportiness that defines the look of all their cars, from the 50s to the current models. Their only missteps, in my opinion, have been the late efforts of their American styling director -- the man responsible for the awkward Z3, and the M3 coupe that brings to mind the ungainly Griffith of the mid to late 60s.

Alfa Romeo probably has the best styling history of ANY marque -- and the BMW 502 certainly echoes certain features of their styling tradition. But they are still beautiful in their own right, and I will take nothing from them because they had the good taste to learn from something truly spectacular."
1231,"July 6, 2001 9:50PM",pablo_l,"Totally agree with you on Alfa Romeo. I think they are back to unique, refreshing designs these days and it is a total shame we can't buy 'em in the US. They had some *dark* years in their recent past, but their current lineup is probably the best designed of any brand.

On BMW, I guess we'll have to disagree on the styling. I see your point. And I do like BMW, and would always check their line-up when getting ready to buy a car (I have owned 2 3-series in the past), but truly can not recall an instance when their styling truly struck me esthetically the way Alfa's or Ferrari's (not that the latter don't have their mis-steps) does. I like them for the great dynamic experience, technology implementation, and yes, competent, albeit not outstanding, design. Their motorcycles reflect the soul of the brand quite a bit, I find - and I love them. The R motorcycles -and I do own one, and love it- are unique: great technology, unique driving experience, sportiness combined with great comfort... and while the design is nice, it is not groundbreaking or goes for passionate esthetics the way an Italian brand would. It is about low-key balance, somehow, no risks and nothing that could be taken to be over-the-top. And when they take risks -like the Z3 you mention-they more often than not screw up, because they seemingly venture out of their comfort zone. I am not at all saying BMWs are ugly, really! I am just saying that I'd associate other things as top BMW core values rather than design by itself."
1232,"July 7, 2001 6:32AM",arcoates,"To some extent Pablo is right. BMW would much rather have the stuff you don't see work perfectly than have a stunner of a car.

1234,"July 11, 2001 10:29AM",arcoates,"At the moment, it's MB who is coming out with daring designs. The S-Class was a large departure from the previous mammoth, squared-off S. The E was daring with those two eyes staring at you, and the C is a scaled down, daring S. The 3 is a bit more conservative, yet it is always described as the best looking sedan of the group. Nevertheless, it is time for BMW to break away from their conservative design, as they are with the new 7. It will take some time for people to realize that this isn't just a smoothed over design, as the previous 7's have been, but a ground up redesign that yes, incorporates BMW design elements, but breaks new ground for the company as well~ A.R."

I ultimately decided on and preordered an Infiniti G35, which I had went to see at the Detroit car show, but will get a Q instead if I don't like the G35.

You are exactly right on the short wheelbase XJ (and for that matter the S-type and the new X-type as well)however the XJ8L has tons of room in the back seat.

I think very soon you will see MB and BMW catching and likely surpassing Lexus in many service catagories. I have a BMW and MB, they are VERY serious about service. Sales people and service people are being docked pay if customer surveys come back anything short of perfect.

1268,"March 6, 2002 8:56AM",wishnhigh1,".25 drag coeficient is pretty hard to believe, but it is possible. Do you have any proof to show this?

Also, a low drag coefficient isnt exactly the best thing in the world. Typically it comes at a cost of reduced downforce, which is not a good thing in high power luxury cars, especially in germany on the autobahn.

Also, does the fact that Lexus uses DVD make it better than one that runs a CD based nav? Is that the only significant difference? As far as I can tell, the DVD only allows more memory storage. It doesnt exactly make it ""higher quality"" or better really."
1269,"March 6, 2002 9:54AM",y338,"DVD based of course can store more info than CD-Rom. The system itself also does the calculation much more faster than others. (I compared the toyo-camry and mb-ML320 navi. and toyo nav just provided more accurate and faster info. Probably Toyo updates the system more frequent! lexus used the cd-rom based a few years ago, but it changed to dvd-based last year. ) You can visit www.lexus.com to check the drag figures. As a matter of fact, the lowest drag makes lexus to become the quietest luxu sedan. It was measured by almost all the auto mags. Quietness might not be the most important factor for the driver, but it is very important for passengers.
I don't understand why those people compared ls430 with S600 and 750il, since they are obviously more expensive. YOu should compare the toyota flagship CENTURY with them.... (it is only sold in JAPAN and a few more countries.) You might not know, Japanese keeps the best things in Japan and never exported."
1270,"March 6, 2002 12:24PM",v12power,"I used those because I own them. Besides they are top of the line from their respective manufacturers, as is the LS430 in this country.

On the nav updates, none of the manufacturers do this themselves. There are companies out there like Navitech that provide the software to auto companies. They compile data and sell it. Lexus does not do it more often, nice try though."
1271,"March 6, 2002 5:36PM",flint350,DVD is far superior to CD - especially when you consider you have to change up to 9 cd's to cover the U.S. With DVD you never have to change the disc. The inferior installation of this in the S Class Benz is a good example of how much better the Lexus system is in usability.

1274,"March 6, 2002 8:18PM",ljflx,"Can you imagine how great a car Lexus would make for $100k? Plus it would still be $15-20k cheaper than an S-600.

I know because I bought their busnesses and have remained close with many of them.

1280,"March 9, 2002 8:30AM",v12power,"Here is a fun paragraph, or two, from the 11/'00 issue of C&D, that tested the new LS430.

""The seven spoke wheels are carbon copies, the chrome outline of the side windows is pure Benz, the headlamps are the S-coupes, and the taillamps are shaped like those on the current E-class. The steering wheel, the shifter, and other interior elements owe a similar debt to Bruno Sacco and his Stuttgart colleagues.""

""The options list also bristles with formerly Benz-only goodies, such as front seats with bottom cushions that move fore and aft independantly of the backrest for thigh support and optional door closers to finish the job for rich, feeble old codgers who can no longer slam a door. Power folding mirrors, adaptive cruise control, voice command for the phone and navigation systems, heated and cooled seats, rear air, a power rear window shade - whatever Mercedes bids, Lexus calls or raises with the new LS430 (except there's not a V12 yet).""

Those boys at Lexus sure are innovators!"
1281,"March 9, 2002 11:47AM",ljflx,"Now let's talk about C&D's objectivity. They review the SC430 vs. the CLK430 in the current issue. What wins all the technical contests - the SC430. What gets the oohs and aahs when they are on the road - the SC430. The SC430 blows away the CLK's interior - even they have to admit that much. The CLK seems to have a pretty serious brake problem - but heck, what importance do brakes have on the road. So what wins the C&D road test. The CLK. Why - subjective or should we really say pyschological opinion. They like the looks of the CLK over the SC430 despite the fact that the people they encounter feel the opposite. They like a German riding car better. They shouldn't have wasted their time doing the test as their decision was made beforehand. I even felt compelled to doublecheck that the author wasn't the French judge at Salt Lake City. So I hope V-12power that you don't really take C&D or any of these people seriously. No one who discredits themselves like that can be taken seriously. They are fans not objective reviewers."

I will remember to not take them seriously next time a Lexus beats an MB or BMW. Love your logic."
1283,"March 9, 2002 8:30PM",ljflx,Bias is obvious when car A outscores car B but the tester votes for car B by giving out higher marks in categories that are purely subjective to his tastes. That's logic 101 - and yes you're right I don't take it seriously when Lexus wins either.

1284,"March 10, 2002 8:39AM",v12power,"I was not trying to compare anything. You brought up a comparison of two vehicles not included in this topic. My post was meant to illustrate who the real leader is in this segment. Although I have no love for the new 745i, once again the Germans have raised the bar. Maybe Lexus will copy the BMWs styling next. It is too bad, as they can obviously stand on their own if they like."
1285,"March 10, 2002 9:10AM",ljflx,"We apparently were making different points - mine being that C&D is hardly a good source document to prove a point. The comparative I used in the current issue was to illustrate that.

The copying topic has been kicked around so often that it is tiring. Many, including myself believe this is pure competition at its best and that MB and BMW have done the same thing in different ways anyway. Notice the proliferation of V-8's after Lexus and Infiniti showed up. Is that copying or response to competition? If Nordstrom were to introduce a new designer that Saks had introduced into their clothing line 6 months earlier are they copying? If you think so than we have different viewpoints about business and no further discussion is needed.

What I always find amusing is no one accuses the German brands from copying each other. Who introduced the first V-12 and who followed suit in this class of cars? If Lexus brings the V-12, that has existed for quite some time in Japan, to American shores it's not copying (to me) but just a further extension of their competitive presence. If they do it they may very well put it in the GS as well and then MB and BMW will have to put it in the E and 5 series. Would anyone cry foul? Certainly not me. They'd be foolish not to. That's why in the long run I think this comes down to MB vs. Lexus as they both have much greater capital resources than does BMW. But no matter what anyone thinks about the latter two I must say that, depite the fact that I also don't like the new 7 and almost find it repulsive, I have a lot of admiration for BMW's fighting spirit and toughness."
1286,"March 10, 2002 10:24AM",merc1,"I think V12 is right. When I saw the car in the #1 spot I knew it would cause an uproar. It seems to me that the CLK scored higher in transmission, handling, ride (Lexus supposed to dominate there right?), driver comfort, styling, open motoring, and fun to drive. I'm having this same conversation in the coupes forum. Better leather/wood/stereo/ doesn't cut it, when the SC430's body is less rigid or the fact that is lack any kind of rollover protection. Leather, wood and stereo's can only carry you so far. The CLK's interior may not be as fancy, but it's far from junk either. Very far from it. I don't see them saying anything about the SC's interior ""blowing away"" the CLK's. I do see where they made reference to a Buick (of all things). The SC is just another yawner on the road, like most Lexuses are. Only the cars styling evokes anything.

Do you really think that that CLK's on the road have a brake problem or that the test car (which is used by all magazines) had been abused to the point of making the brakes fail, abuse that probably took place before C&D got the car. Considering that it was the ONLY CLK430 Cabrio MBUSA has in the fleet it's used by anyone requesting a test drive. CLK's don't have a brake problem, that's pure fantasy. The outcome of this test should be no surprise, the more driver focused car always wins at C&D. And these wins in the ""technical"" categories you're speaking of were by a mere tenth of a second or a mere 1 mph. Come on you've got to know that when two cars are that close in numbers the subjective things like styling/ride/handling and others determine the winner. I know you know this. Even their prices are the same so the Lexus couldn't win on that either.

On this copying thing. It's been said many times many ways, but Lexus remains the number one copy cat of the auto industry. Period. Mercedes and BMW rarely if ever copy a thing from either other. They, together set the standard for the rest to follow, period. Lexus included. Competition is what Lexus is, but taking a whole bodystyle from another brand is copying.

I agree that if I wanted either of these cars I wouldn't base my decision on a C&D article or any other magazine, but they do point out the traits of the cars in question.

1287,"March 11, 2002 7:50PM",ljflx,We've disagreed before so it'll be the same here. No way do I take the MB CLK over the SC430 here. Nor do I even consider it. But if you're talking the new SL that's a different story. Spectacular car from everything I've read and beautifully styled but let's remember it's also $25k+ more. But - if I still need 3 vehicles in about 2 years and if business things go for me the way I currently expect - than I'm giving the SL a serious look at the time as the third car. Before my wife and I got married we always said we wanted his and her SL's. We actually knew a couple that did though they were quite a bit older than us. But those were the pre-children and pre-Lexus days.
1288,"March 11, 2002 8:17PM",ljflx,"Never answered your questions on my cars. I have the two LS430's and an LX470. I had an old style Landcruiser and was going to get the new model. I loved the cruiser and it was as reliable as a Lexus. But then my Lexus salesman, who knew I would be looking again at at the TLC cut me a deal on an LX470 for only $15 a month more than a TLC would cost. So I went with it plus I got it in the color I wanted. The differences between the two are that the Lexus can lower the suspension when you park which is great if you have older parents. It also rides smoother and quieter and has more interior wood, better leather and the memory seat positions. I am limited in SUV's as I need the space and I must have 3 rows of seats. The LX470 gives me all that and is the largest SUV my wife will drive.

I have a nice position when it comes to cars. I get a generous auto allowance from my job which basically pays for one car and I get a tax deduction for the truck as I have a successful business (in which I am a partner) outside of my job. Choosing the LS430 was not an economical decision for me - I just felt it bested the S-500 in the things I desired in a car. It's nice to haver choices. Would I have been happy in an S-500? Do you know anyone who wouldn't be. But in all honesty MB's reliability issue is concerning and has to be addressed."

Yes they have smaller problems with switches, and things of the like, but the driving makes up the difference for some.

1290,"March 12, 2002 7:17AM",v12power,"I JUST got my new C&D yesterday. I have FINALLY read the articles in question. On the CLK vs SC430, I would definately side with C&D and get the CLK. I like the looks better. I like the idea of a stiffer structure and better handling. The features issue and extra glitzy Lexus interior are a distant second on my priority list. That I think is where Merc and I differ from toyotas1. A dvd nav system does not appeal to me. I have two cars with nav systems. In the last three years I have actually used this feature on one trip.

I also do not think adding stiffer springs to the SC is going to transform it. If you think about it, the Lexus drew critisism for a flexy structure. It demonstrated flex with soft springs. What do you think the result of adding stiffer springs would be? You may get some handling improvement, more likely you will be overtaxing the structure insighting more chassis flex and ultimately squeaks and rattles. It would take more than that to cure the SCs handling deficit.

I think the SL500 was well received. They had a couple negatives. Most had to do with the lees than sporting nature of the car. WELL, it is not intended to be a sports car. The AMG version will address that, as they noted. There is simply no comparison between the SC and SL. An objective comparision test would surely demonstrate where the extra $25k was spent."

1294,"March 13, 2002 6:11AM",v12power,"""Features are copied all the time. That is a stupid thing to even bring up.""

That is a pretty shortsighted view, don't you think? How about features like ABS braking systems and supplemental restraint systems? These now commonplace systems were pioneered by MB. Somebody has to innovate, or nothing changes, or at best change is painfully slow.

MB even pioneered crash testing so that we could all be a little safer. So you would rather send your money to the copy cat company? Wouldn't it make more sense to send your money to the company on the leading edge? How else do we improve automobiles? If everybody copied like Lexus who would lead?

They copy brand new features. Some of you Lexus supporters act like Lexus offers this cutting edge sedan for less. Ironically they didn't invent anything on the car, somebody else did. I guess if that is OK with you, be my guest. I prefer to send my dough to a company that actively improves the standards of the whole industry, to all of our benefit, rather than pick up a knock off for less and consider myself wise for doing so.

You claim that Lexus copies very little. Funny, did you read post 1284? There is a pretty good list of innovative features that MB invented and brought to the market. Lexus then copied them and undersold the innovator. The list included; heated and cooled seats, power sunshades, power door closers, adaptive cruise control, voice recognition systems.

I have just been using the S600 because it is an easy referance for me. We can use the S430 if you like, it is essentially the same car.

You claim Lexus has added many innovations over the last 10 years. Please list their innovations."
1295,"March 13, 2002 6:23AM",antiosama,"v12power, You're just another joke waiting to happen. You're just like every other prestige loving fool.

Every company copies from other companies. It's how products are improved. Benz has given a lot of innovations to the automobile market, but that doesn't mean whatsoever that I will pay them $10K more for a similar product or for a lesser product. To say things like power seats are copied is ridiculous. It's not really what I would consider a innovation. Wow, a extra motor is added to make one more cushion move. How about power closing doors. A motor is placed so that the door is closed. Again, not much innovation. And alot of the features you see on cars that are really innovations are not at all innovated by the car makers. Try Bosch, Delphi, Visteon, etc. for parts innovations. Generally these companies work with the car companies to come up with new products.

Let's see Lexus is on the cutting edge on many planes. Do you see any other carmaker matching the quality of a Lexus? I see after 10 years+ BMW and Mercedes still can't touch a Lexus for quality. I see plenty of innovation in that. They keep pushing the envelope and nobody can catch up. And please don't tell me that isn't part of the car. Because how you build a car has everything to do with a car. The Japanese innovate in many areas. Typically German car fanatics can't take it, because they are too full of their rolling snob mobiles.

Adaptive cruise control. Give me a break. Both companies-Lexus & MB-were working on these at a similar time. As usual, the credit goes to Benz for no reason. YOu fail to realize that alot of carmakers are designing similar features at the same time.

I suppose Benz introducing Air-conditioned seats would be copying Lincoln?"
1296,"March 13, 2002 8:03AM",v12power,"I guess when it gets down to the facts of the matter, and you cannot compete, the insults start to fly.

So you are able to list ONE supposesed inovation, quality? At the same time the things MB brought to market first, the things they innovated are discounted by you. It only counts if you say so right? Credit goes to Benz when it is deserved, when you are first, thats it, pretty simple.

This quality thing is so overblown. Sorry but Lexus is NOT on a plane above the rest. I have owned MB products for years. I have not had a single failure on any of them. Routine maint is all they have ever required. Best of all, unlike Lexus, all of my maint is paid! On my Benz to 36k miles and on my BMW to 50k miles. You must pay for Lexus service, and it isn't cheap. C&D long term tests show Lexus cars to have higher than average maint costs over 40k miles.

My MB experience has been very good, why change? My BMW experience has been very different. I have had MANY repairs on my 7 series BMWs. Multiple trips for the same problem, waiting for parts, worthless customer service at the factory level. Lexus certainly has most manufacturers beat. This is changing. MB(and BMW) now issue surveys at every visit. If things are not perfect, the contact employee is docked pay. The level of service is already MUCH improved and is bound to succeed by holding people accountable.

So the quality gap is a pretty thin margin to be staking your entire argument on. The gap is nowhere near what you suggest, in my actual experience with the cars. The innovations come from the Germans, always have. Your inability to list ten years worth of innovation by Lexus clearly illustrates this.

If buying the finest product I can afford makes me a snob, well, so be it. I'm just not a K-Mart shopper."

1298,"March 13, 2002 4:22PM",antiosama,"As I said before, v12 driver, many things are innovated by many companies at the same time. Adaptive cruise control is not just a mercedes innovation. Long before Lexus even introduced adaptive cruise, dateline on NBC showed Toyota testing adaptive cruise. That was several years before the LS430 ever hit the streets.

I never stated Mercedes hasn't innovated. They are clearly the leaders in innovation. But as with most Mercedes fans, you also make it out as only Mercedes innovating. Where do all the electronics innovations come from? That is typically Japan. As I said before, the technology that goes into building a Lexus, Mercedes or BMW can't match. And it shows in many areas. I'm sure just like a typical German car fan, you'll say JD power's and Consumer's Reports are biased or their testing is flawed. But realistically it speaks volume about how well about the technology that goes into every Lexus product. Also who had Nav systems in cars long before Mercedes? TOyota had them years before Mercedes did. And when Mercedes was still lugging around with archaic stereo systems with paper speakers and crappy sound quality, lexus was designing a ground breaking stereo system with Nakamichi. Let's move on to the 1995 LS400 being the first car to have front seats with it's own suspension system. Or the innovative climate control system of the 1995 LS400. Let's not forget a innovation Mercedes still can't seem to muster, a in-dash CD changer. Quiet-can anyone make a car as quiet as a Lexus? If you don't think this is constant innovation, you're kidding yourself. To make a car quiet takes alot more than just packing the car with foam & weight.

I had a 88 Benz S-class. It was a very good car. It was extremely reliable up to 100K miles. I was very happy with it. But the new E-class(in 2000) and S430 were simply outclassed by the LS400. Yes, the S430 has slightly better handling and more features but it also costs about $20 grand more. The E-class costs a about the same as the 2000 LS400 but with less feature content. And luxury. And both Benz's had subpar interior quality. The plastic, leather, & vinyl in both of these cars felt cheaper than my 88 420SEL. As for handling, as I said, the S430 is slightly better and ultimately that doesn't cut it. Especially considering I spend 70% of my time in traffic and the rest lugging the family around. Who has time to be Mario Andretti? As the name suggests, it's a Luxury car and luxury is the top priority for the average luxury car buyer. How many S430 customers do you think buy a S430 for it's handling? I can guarantee very few."
1299,"March 13, 2002 4:47PM",ajvdh,"""the technology that goes into building a Lexus, Mercedes or BMW can't match""

OK, where's the Lexus equivalent of BMW's valvetronic technology (no throttle plate, drastically increasing efficiency)? Or an active anti-roll system? Or the doors that hold open at any arbitrary angle (not just at detents)?

I don't see them selling electro-hydraulic braking like MB does. What about MB's ABC suspension - the nearest thing to a true ""active"" suspension on the market?

Toyota does a lot of things right, but to claim that they're technologically head and shoulders above MB or BMW is evidence of blind bias."

His response was that it was a nice to have feature but hardly needed. I then asked how often it was optioned in. Response - 1 in 10 cars. So please - stop the nonsesnse. 10% of the buyers opt for a technology that is not needed and maybe is used 1-10% of the time on a good day.

The difference between Lexus and MB on the technology front is that Lexus pours its' money into things you enjoy all the time. A radio may be something un-important to some people on this board but to Lexus buyers its more important than ABC.

A Lexus buyer wants a supreme luxury ride with a royalty like cabin. A BMW buyer doesn't. They prefer a hard riding car. That is called carving out your customer base and has nothing to do with which car is better. The fact that the 7 has never sold more than 18k cars in a year is an indication of where the preferences lie in this niche.

Does anyone in his right mind think that Toyota, who has a financial position MB and BMW can only dream of, couldn't match MB innovations if it thought it was prudent? They take a more common sense American approach while MB and BMW duke it out to be king of Europe."

Quiet is not a Lexus only option. I tested a new LS430 and my '98 750 back to back one day. The BMW was noticably more quiet and rode smoother than the Lexus. To be fair, I suspect the dual pane windows unique to the 750(in BMWs line) made this possible. None of these cars is going to make your ears bleed, you are splitting hairs on this subject.

ljflx, you make a very important point. These cars all have sublte niches in the high lux arena. Lexus offers value and excellent customer care. They cover most of the bases and provide a price leader in the segment. BMW used to be the home of the sporty driver. I am sadly dissappointed by the new 7, a column shifter in a drivers car??? Yet they raise the bar again with the latest design. MB seems to have several irons in the fire. They are providing technological innovation with ABC and brake by wire systems. They are trying to take a bite out of BMWs niche with the AMG cars, every line has one now. They are admittedly playing catch-up to Lexus in customer service and initial quality. All of this and still trying to foster its long heritage.

""innovative climate control"" on a '95 LS400?? You mean the one they plagarized from the new in '92 S-Class? Actually they didn't have four zone until the LS430 did they?

What are you talking about? ABC is used anytime you manuver the car. It keeps the driver and
passengers from being tossed around and keeps the body level. I find it ironic that the features that get knocked are NOT on Lexus cars. People don't buy 60K cars based on their stereos, if any do that's saddening. Oh Toyota will try to match these features, once they've had time to study them.

My point is that it may be a bragging point but it's in 10% of S-class cars and maybe 1% of all MB cars and while it may be in use 100% of the time I'll bet most people couldn't tell the difference between a car with it or without it."
1305,"March 14, 2002 10:44AM",v12power,"...you're wrong. It is very easy to detect. The car has NO body roll, yet the ride remains compliant.

The biggest stumbling block in this discussion is different priorities when buying a car. I think the Lexus guys are correct, many people would prefer a better stereo system over a better suspension system. Many lux car buyers are most concerned about the quiet smooth ride, not the cars handling. Many lux car buyers have absolutely no need for the ""extras"" MB provides, thus the extra money would be spent foolishly.

I personally have a different set of priorities. After several driving schools and tons of track time in my Porsche, I have developed an affinity for the way a car drives. The BMW and MB products cater to this more than the Lexus. I also greatly prefer the styling on the Germans, just a personal preferance again.

I am not alone in these preferances. I have many friends in the P-car club that choose luxo sedans on the same criteria. I have yet to see a Lexus in one of these guys garages. Nothing wrong with the car, it just appeals to people for different reasons. I don't think being a snob is one of them, not in my experience anyway.

I also believe the Germans are better engineered cars. The premium price is relfected in areas you do not see. This is convienient for Lexus, the less demanding (performance wise) Lexus owners will never notice, or care. I do, I pay the premium, I enjoy the superior feel of my cars. I think they are worth every extra penny. I certainly don't blame you for feeling otherwise."

nealm1,

And you're reasoning is why Lexus cars are looked up as great cars, but no fun to drive, basically a yawning coffin. This whole thing got started with one word innovations. Neither of you can point to a true innovation like ABC or SBC from Lexus. Yeah and I guess anyone of these cars here has an exhaust that will wake up the neighbors right.

You will see pics of my V12 cars, my Porsche on the racetrack and my Geleandewagen way off the road. I buy my vehicles with purposeful use in mind. I find the German vehicles are better at their targeted purpose, unlike Lexus which seems to take the ""shotgun"" approach.

No one who has driven the 7 or the S would deny that they are terrific cars. And I can tolterate -- even enjoy -- the Deutschland-uber-ales cheerleading that comes from fans of both brands. What I find inconceivable is the delight supposedly mature adults take in ""racing"" ANY car on a crowded urban expressway (here the Kennedy) finding sport in passing a tractor trailer on the shoulder of the road.

1312,"March 14, 2002 5:19PM",ljflx,"I'm not knocking ABC. I'm sure it's a marvelous engineering feat. I'm saying it is hardly ever purchased in the first place. Why over-engineer a car? Reminds me of the technology guys I had to deal with that want perfection in a product at all costs but the market won't pay or opt for it. I appreciate that V-12 power is one of the guys that likes that perfection, notices subtle differences in a car, can afford it and has no issue paying for it. But he's an exception to the rule not a standard. Most MB S-class buyers obviously pass on it.

You act like I'm jealous that Lexus doesn't have it? Who cares. If they developed it and offered it I'd pass on it. My point is simple - Lexus is trying to appeal to the masses and makes strategic decisions based on things those masses will appreciate the most. That is always a smart business strategy. Besides do you really think a company like Lexus couldn't develop it?? They have virtually unlimited capital resources and they reside in a country where engineers have to construct buildings to withstand powerful earthquakes. You think thoses engineers couldn't do whatever they wanted with a car?"
1313,"March 14, 2002 6:22PM",flint350,"Why don't you consider consolidating the 2 ""high end"" boards. They are virtually indistinguishable as they are now. The Euro/Japanese/Amer. title is probably closest to a compromise without listing specific models."
1314,"March 14, 2002 7:43PM",v12power,"You have summerized my view nicely. Lexus is trying to appeal to the masses. As you have noted this is smart business practice. I think they are also smart to allow others to develop much of the newest technology. Then they can pass on certain new tech items that probably wouldn't help sales anyway. All of these things make it easy for Lexus to offer a premium car at a lower price.

Could they do it? I think it is foolish to assume otherwise. You are correct, they have the resources to be a leader.

One notion that seems to lurk around here, and any discussion of premium autos, is the one that says people buy MB just for status. I think that is a bit insulting to the owners of any of these cars.You generally do not amass the wealth to buy one of these cars by being foolish or wasteful. I do not think I am a big minority among buyers of the S-Class or 7 series. There are tons of people that prefer the driving feel of the MB. They are willing to pay the premium for that largely intangible feature. Undoubtably the Lexus is a fine machine, and a superb value at that. There must be plenty of people that also value the German driving experience. I think you are kidding yourself when you assume MB or BMW buyers are only concerned with the badge on the hood. If you really did not like the car that much better, what is the reason for spending sooo much more. I just do not accept that it is because the owners are shallow badge snobs. Like I stated before, that has definately NOT been my experience.

I would be willing to bet that in many cases, speaking to the owner of a new MB or BMW would yeild a very different conversation than the one with a new Lexus owner. The MB and BMW guys I know could site all kinds of techno info about their cars. I think the Lexus owner is much less likely to be interested in the mechanical workings of their car. Different strokes for different folks. Just don't pass of MB and BMW owners a dupes because they could have had the Lexus for less. Accept that they may just really appreciate their cars for very different reasons than you love your Lexus."
1315,"March 14, 2002 7:58PM",wishnhigh1,"I have been trying to say that for so long. Somehow some of these Lexus advocates are telling me that the only reason to buy a Mercedes is for the badge snobery. They go spouting mercedes drivers are snobs...etc.

A Lexus may be cheaper but it still is in the luxury car class(READ: Wasted money!). People buy luxury cars because they want luxury cars. They don't need luxury cars. That would make a Lexus driver just as snobby, under your own conditions, as a Mercedes driver.

Get over it...Mercedes owners drive their cars for their own reasons, which may or may not be what you think they are. To some it is worth the extra money, and for you it isnt. No big deal."
1316,"March 14, 2002 8:54PM",ljflx,"Not a statement I ever made. I almost bought the S-class. Had I done so I wouldn't want anyone saying I was a snob. I drive around my town and I see many people who own both a MB and a Lexus so I'm not sure I agree with your point. In some cases it's an E and an an ES-300. One guy has an LS430 and an S-430. Be interesting to get his viewpoint. I'm sure one is his and the other's his wife's. Heck - I almost took an E instead of the second LS430 for a job change that required driving 120 miles a day last year. But I thought the E had a ridiculous lease deal and I preferred the comfort and roominess of another big lux car in the end. There are many that have S or E class cars (or BMW's) interspersed with LX470's and Landcruisers. It's funny but rarely do I see a Range Rover. I rarely see your situation though - a BMW and an MB under one roof. Where I live though Lexus and MB are far more popular than BMW's. The point is that as much as we debate the cars there are many cross-bred owners. A guy in my parking garage at work just matched his old body S-500 with an SC430. I cringe when I go past either of his cars because he's parked right at the edge of a row where many turns are made and there isn't a lot of space for turning.

The bottom line is most people who own or lease these cars make 250-500k or more per year and have accumulated wealth or have equity positions that will give them future wealth. There are many who consider anyone in that bracket to either be a snob, be perceived as a snob or be eligible to be called a snob. What can you do?"

Loosen up some, if you live in the Chicago area you know full well that this is going on right now, there is nothing you nor I can do about it, so just drive defensively and don't worry about it. And I take it you've never driven your LS430 past 65 mph then right? If you have then be quiet, you're just as bad.

ljflx,

Overengineering as you put it is part of the Mercedes way or tradition. How do you know that ABC is hardly ever ordered? For one it's standard on the S600/CL600, S55, CL500, CL55 and new SL500 so it's out there in decent numbers, and there people right here on Edmunds in the S-Class topic that have it on their S500's so some do think it's a legitimate option. I'm sure Lexus could come up with something like ABC, they've had 3 years to study it complements of MB. If they have all this engineering prowess why don't they ever come up with something first? Not everyone wants a car that appeals to everyone, some want something that stands out from the herd. ABC is one of the reasons MB cars do.

1318,"March 15, 2002 8:48AM",ljflx,"Maybe the whole snob issue is not aimed at the people who buy the cars but at the manufacturers particularly MB and BMW but more so MB. I never see anyone saying anything about Audi. Remember the statements of these companies. MB - ""if we build it they will come"". BMW - ""We are BMW and we do what we want"". If the brand is viewed as snobbish then the spillover to the consumers who buy it can be expected. Lexus has been humble up to the last few years but their new one - ""isn't it time you deserve a Lexus"" will get them the snobbish view also.

Merc1 - you confuse business strategies with auto enthusiast desires. Lexus has executed their strategy spectacularly. They don't care about a few auto enthusiast opinions. Guaranteed though - that will change over time probably in the next couple of years."

IJFX - You make some good points as well. Lexus has performed their business plan well. I know that for awhile Lexus offered a European sport ride for their LS430, but have discontinued it as their customers didn't perfer that ride on a Lexus. I know we perfer that type of ride on our BMW and P-car, not our Lexus.

The first to introduce a technical innovation or a safety innovation, I would have to give to MB and BMW. But not a day goes by that I wouldn't love to see MB, P-car and BMW have a stereo and a DVD nav system like Lexus.

All of these marques have their good and bad points but have you ever asked someone who owns both a BMW /Lexus or a MB/Lexus which one they would give up? I believe most will say, neither one. I know, we wouldn't."
1321,"March 17, 2002 3:00PM",ljflx,"I see you have the LX470. How do you like it? I have an 01 and I'm still amazed that a truck as massive as that rides like a luxury sedan. I also didn't hear that they stopped production on the euro sport package. Are you sure they did?

By the way anyone reading the GS board where there is a discussion that just about all Lexus models are on the verge of redesign. My Lexus sales guy had told me the LS430 may get a complete redesign for 2004 but someone there is saying it will actually happen for 2003."
1322,"March 17, 2002 7:34PM",bernard1,"Love our LX. Purchased new in 99 and haven't had any problems. Rides like a luxury sedan and makes it hard to go after a sedan. I looked at the LS430 but could not give up the LX for the LS. According to my Lexus dealer, demand was low for the European option so they discontinued it. He may be wrong, but I haven't seen it offered of late.

It's Ok with me because when it comes to the sport ride, BMW wins hands down. I use the Lexus when comfort in paramount and the BMW for a large sporty vehicle and the Porsche is the sports car of the bunch.

I haven't heard about the redsign for Lexus although I have heard about the new larger SUV. I have a feeling with the 745i taking the first major leap, MBZ, Audi and Lexus will be scrambling for something to compete with it."
1323,"March 17, 2002 10:28PM",merc1,"Well there probably won't be another S8 next year. The regular ""A8"" will debut first with the ""S8"" being a year or two down the line.

The LS430 will NOT be redesigned for 2003. I think what's being confused here is the difference between a facelift and a redesign. The LS430 may get a facelift for 2003, more power, equipment, new front and rear ends, but no car of this class (or cars period) gets a total redesign in just 2 years, thats way too expensive even for Toyota.

M"
1324,"March 18, 2002 7:15AM",ljflx,"I agree with you but I wouldn't rule out 2004 as a major change. I would think 2003 is a facelift possibility and 04 could be a follow through to 2003. Remember also Lexus needs to get some momentum in Europe. I also think that time periods for these re-designs will be shortening up. It's too competitive, too lucrative, and too profitable for it to be any other way with 3-5 players in the game - if VW is to be taken seriously. Audi is definitely in the group but not taken seriously in the US. I'll never understand what VW is doing, given it's position with Audi. If Infiniti ever hits it they could be added but I don't count them in as yet as they are a step below in buyer profiles.

I think shortening the time frames is a natural business phenomena as only the strongest capital rich companies survive so you weed out the weaker players. They either go away or get acquired. I also think that the time period to re-design is more tied to units sold in such an enviroment. Lexus did sell 8,000 cars (33%) over what they projected in that first year."
1325,"March 18, 2002 10:02AM",bobbyknight,"When you sink 1.2 billion on the cost of a redesign like MB did with the E-class then it seems foolish to redesign a model every 3 or 4 years. Where is the return on investment?

1326,"March 18, 2002 7:22PM",bernard1,"You're probably right. Most buyers of high end cars don't expect them to change much over a 6 to 7 yr period of time.

Merc1 - If the S8 will be 2 to 3 yrs away before a new body style, too bad. Audi's all wheel drive system, aluminum body/frame, and sport package with a new shell might finally give MB & BMW a run for there money in America. I know we are still considering one, but the 745i at this point is so far ahead, it's hard to wait for Audi to catch up."
1327,"March 18, 2002 11:05PM",merc1,"That's true....*somewhat*, but trust me I know that the LS430 won't be full redesigned until at least 2006. Not even Toyota could re-do the entire car from the ground up in just 2 years of being on the market, it simply doesn't make business sense. My postion on redo is that if a car is a great design it can last 5-7 years, look at the previous 7-Series and S-Class. To me it takes something away from the brand if they keep redoing their cars ever 3-4 years, like Honda used to do the Accord. To me that says the design wasn't any good in the first place if its out-done in just 4 years. I swear I could tell my life events by Honda Accords. I think Mercedes is replacing the CLK too soon. The E-Class (though I hate to see it go) is getting it's redo right in time, I always get watery eyed when an E is replaced, I really had trouble letting the W124 E-Class (1986-1995) go.

Audi. They are taken very seriously in Europe, but you're right about the their U.S. situation. Part of this is Audi's own fault because they always hesitate when bringing their best cars here. The A8 didn't get here until 1997, though it came out in 1994. They wasted time with the A8L and S8. That may be changing because they're bringing the giant-killer RS6(!) here right after the Euro introduction.

Infiniti. They're just seemingly lost. The Q45 doesn't fit, it's bigger and more powerful than anyone's mid-level cars, but can't match most bigger luxury cars. They touted the Q45 as a sports sedan, but it's really too large for that, then it's styling is not right to me. Now they have another car coming that will slot in between the I35 and the Q45, more confusion. They make some good cars, but not ""great"" ones. The only Infiniti I see that will be truly ""hot"" will be the FX45 crossover.

bernard1,

Well there will be a new A8 soon. I predict it will be introduced at the Paris show this fall and go on sale in the U.S. next spring as a 2004 model, with a new S8 a year later. I say if you like the style of the 745i go for it, nothing in this segment (right now) is more advanced, and the 745i reeks of quality and still delivers that BMW driving feel.

BMW is another story, since the marque appeals predominantly to ""enthusiasts"" and therefore I suppose the existence of the M branding helps the image of BMW as a whole. But I would bet that if you interviewed 100 people visiting your local MB store, not more than one or two would even know what AMG is.

Mercedes has a 469hp E55K coming, Jaguar has a 400hp S-Type R coming in May, so yes Audi needs to field a car here.

And on the value of a ""tuned"" A6, your response is internally inconsistent: ""It's not about ""sales"" it's about . . . rub-off sales on ""lesser"" A6 models."" Unless Audi is less of a player than I imagined, everything they DO should be ""about sales."" Otherwise, I pity its shareholders. And I suspect that you are correct that the *perceived* value in such a car is what you call ""rub-off""sales on ""lesser"" models. But that was my point: My perhaps uninformed intuition is that Audi doesn't need these cars to compete with MB or Lexus (as much as perceived value, dealer commitment and luxury), since 99 44/100% of the target customers don't know about or car about ""tuned"" cars and the relative handful that do won't generate enough PROFITS to make the exercise worthwhile. As for BMW, I just don't know if Audi sees BMW as the real bogie.

Because I think that competition makes all the products of these companies better, I hope Audi begins making irresistable cars and that I end up buying one some day. Because I couldn't care less about ""bragging rights [and] image,"" the fact that they produce a smallish car with unusable horsepower (at least in my urban environment) doesn't make that eventuality any more likely."
1345,"March 22, 2002 7:10AM",v12power,"I think there is a much larger market for the ""tuned"" cars than nealm1 suggests. I would guess that any repeat BMW customer is well aware of the M series cars, they have become automotive icons. I think any MB buyer under the age of fifty is well aware of the AMG cars. I think Audi is coming late, but they have made a name for themselves with cars like the superb S4. These are the models the car mags test, they are the models many people recognize FIRST in the line-up. They are image leaders, the push the limits of performance and luxury. To discount them as obscure and devoid of profitability is naive.

IMO this is a realm Lexus will never enter. Maybe this is based on special models not being as profitable. This would keep prices down on mainstream models, as they do not subsidise the specials. I just don't think they can turn out leading edge performance models. Japan has never been successful in that niche. Good value for the masses, not much for real car enthusiasts."
1346,"March 22, 2002 10:51AM",nealm1,"This discussion raises an interesting factual question that someone on this board must be able to answer: For what percentage of Mercedes' sales do the AMG cars account? Same for Audi S and BMW M.

My guess is that v12power is right about BMW, i.e., that the percentage of BMW buyers that know and care about M cars is much higher than for the others, and that M accounts for a higher percentage of BMW sales than do ""S"" and AMG for Audi and MB respectively. I bet the answer for MB is that AMG amounts to no more than decimal dust. I also believe that he is right that it makes business sense for BMW, even if the number of M sales is low since it reinforces BMW's image as a performance leader. I bet v12 is wrong about the margins on the S and AMG cars; my guess is that they are sold at MUCH higher margins that the regular cars - but perhaps not high enough to justify the cap costs.

As for whether Lexus will compete in this category at some point, I suppose we will have to wait and see. The ""L"" tuned GS and the IS suggest that they are at least taking a hard look at it. But if they think it doesn't make sense from an ECONOMIC perspective, they won't do it, since being an ""image"" leader for that sake alone is bad business."
1347,"March 22, 2002 12:36PM",v12power,"Take a look at the AMG cars. You have the C32 AMG and SLK32 AMG sharing most AMG unique components. You have the CLK55, E55,ML55 and S55 all using the same engine and likely transmission. AMG wheels are offered in sport packages across the board. While the AMG cars may be unique, MB wisely employs economys of scale to make it work. The premium for these cars is not all that high when comparably equipped(minus AMG specifics). I doubt they are losing money here.

The Audi S4 uses the same powerplant as the A6 2.7T and All Road Quattro. The S6 avant and S8 share the V8. I think these cars are mis-characterized as unique, one-of, type vehicles."

Audi has been late to bring over their best cars which have left them out of the loop to compete with BMW's 540 and M5. Now they are stepping to the plate but must continue to push they perfomance autos including the S8."

The problem I see for AMG is that their cars are autos while the M cars are manual.

Audi has been late to bring over their best cars which have left them out of the loop to compete with BMW's 540 and M5. Now they are stepping to the plate but must continue to push their perfomance autos including the S8."

My good friend just bought an AMG C36, the first factory AMG car here. I am wanting the next one, the C43 very badly. These cars absolutely rip! The newer auto transmissions are awfully quick and pretty smart. They do not hamper the performance anymore, just some of the involvement. I would still prefer the C43 over a similar year M3 just for the V8.

I definately shop MB and BMW against each other. BMW always wins for involvement, they are the only ones big into the manual trans market still. My recent experiences with poor quality led me to choose MB this last time. Oh, it was faster too!"
1351,"March 22, 2002 7:22PM",ljflx,"Nealm1 - I remember reading in a business magazine article on autos that worldwide amg sales are in the teens - that's it. I think the number was 16,000-18,000. If I remember right the company only has several hundred employees. That's why I was also saying many posts back that very few MB cars have ABC. Yes ABC may be standard on many of those models but they are very few and very far between. If my salesman was accurate less than 10% of S-class buyers opt for it. I would assume he was excluding the S-600 where it is standard but that is also a low sales volume car. Sure it'll be an option on the E but I'd bet it sells in 1-2% of the E volume. How many people want to pay more for an E-class car than you'd pay for an S-430?

I also hope everyone remembers that AMG was acquired by MB and not built internally. I doubt it is very profitable because very few custom products,in any industry are. Syndicated products are always where the profits are made. If Lexus goes the tuned route it will be as a loss leader to draw in a younger crowd."
1352,"March 22, 2002 7:57PM",ljflx,"If memory serves me right MB's acquisition of AMG was simply a logical and, at least in my opinion, a very smart thing to do.

1353,"March 22, 2002 9:44PM",merc1,"I think you missunderstood what I meant. What I'm saying is that sales of the RS6 aren't as important, hence the small numbers make good sense....it's the sales of the regular A6 models that are helped by having a car like the RS6 on board. Yes Audi has issues at the dealership level, but it's not as widespread as some would like you to believe. Your point about what Audi needs is almost correct....actually they need both...cars like the RS6, S8 etc and a good dealer body to compete with Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, BMW etc. The ""profits"" on the A6 range have probably been made already hence the very late arrivial of a car like the RS6. Profits are not everything, thats what I like about the European makes, they'll build the fun cars...profits not being the main priority, the cars are. Again, Audi will ""profit"" from those regular A6s that are sold, and at the same time the whold brand is strengthened. M, AMG and S cars are NOT about sales, thats what the regular models are for. These are specialty cars and specialty cars are....well the specialty of most European carmakers. Rare cars like the CL55, SL55, M5, Z8 and the like build the image of the brand which in turns opens the wallets. People who buy S500 with the AMG Sport package get a car that looks very similar to a S55, that has it's appeal. Trust me Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi don't build anything they can't make money on. Especially Mercedes-Benz.

I just don't think a person that likes a car like the LS430 will ever see the point of a RS6, M5, E55 etc....again nothing wrong with a Lexus, but the excitement is sorely missing.

ljflx,

Your numbers about AMG's production and employees *sounds* about right, from what I last read on AMG myself. However AMG may have just as well been in-house all along, the two guys that started AMG are former MB engineers. Complete MB ownership of AMG isn't complete until 2007. Mercedes is now working with Brabus (in secret). If you think AMG's cars are over the top check out some of Brabus' work.

1354,"March 23, 2002 8:07AM",ljflx,"I thought they bought it outright in 99. By the way owneship by former engineers doesn't ensure anything though I'm sure they had some key relationships. Remember that Compaq was started by former IBM execs.

1357,"March 23, 2002 5:36PM",ljflx,"Many high-end buyers like to mix luxury cars and sport cars. The old MB cars were never performance oriented cars nor is a base S-class car much of a performer though it's more so than past generation ones. Yet in the past how often would you see those same owners have a Porsche or an SL or even a Vette in their garages or in their second home. It's a joke for anyone to think an LS430 buyer isn't into or wouldn't appreciate a performance car. But you buy based on your priorities. Luxury, a spectacular ride and reliability are more important to me than performance particularly when you have kids in the car most of time. When I'm driving alone, it's in a NY area rush hour 90% of the time - so good luck being able to have fun in those moments. Lexus scores as high on the scale as possible in my priorities and I'm sure that's the case for most LS430 owners. Given this customer base is mainly $250k per year and up the value side is a nice extra but by no means the main reason you buy the car. Remember how it was impossible to get your hands on a $71k ultra when these cars first came out."
1358,"March 23, 2002 6:48PM",bernard1,"I'm not sure what you are trying to tell me. We seem to agree that most Lexus owners appreciate perfomance auto's in addition to luxury autos. I also agree that now and in the past, many luxury car owners also had a perfomance car. I remembe when MB cars were considered a perfomance sedan in the 70's when Cadillac/Contenintal was still king of the road and truly floated like a boat. In fact there were very few large sedans in America at that time that could compete with a 450 SEL or SE.

I don't know where the 250K base comes from or why it would matter especially with leases as popluar as they are. When the LS first appeared (they were termed Near luxury) a lot of previous MBZ & BMW owners started buying them, one of the reasons they would give at the time was ""We saved 30K"". This was not a reference to their ability to afford the additional 30K, but that they got everything they wanted/required in the LS and they didn't spend the additional 30K, on the S class."
1359,"March 23, 2002 6:53PM",bernard1,"One execellent point you make and that is reliability. Lexus has certainly proven it's reliability and has forced MB and BMW to improve their warranties, service and treatment of customers. We own all 3 makes and it's truly a different feel when you go into a Lexus dealership for service. The others are doing better and are really making an effort but they have a way to go to catch Lexus in this area."
1360,"March 23, 2002 7:20PM",ljflx,"My point was that LS430 buyers are not buying because of value - it's a side benefit and a wonderful one at that. I agree with your point completely on the performance issue re the typical Lexus buyer. Historically, and today as well, only a tiny handful of those buyers who can afford whatever cars they want will restrict their purchases to performance cars."
1361,"March 23, 2002 8:27PM",ljflx,"As I was driving by the local MB dealership today (BTW it's a MB and Honda dealership - how's that for a combo) I saw the big auto truck off-loading all new SL's. That's all he had loaded on the truck. Definitely a stunning car. Must say I wouldn't mind having one now that I've seen it in the flesh. And unlike the 7 it doesn't matter what color it's in.

You see I can be objective.

I've driven the SC430 and it rides beautifully. I'd love to see how the SL rides. If I get a chance to I'll let you know.

The SC430 will probably have a ""softer"" ride than the SL500, at the expense of handling. Yeah a Honda/MB combo is odd since in the Chicago area Honda is almost always a stand alone franchise. Interesting. I did a lot of study on Lexus back in 1988-1989 because I always get caught up in the hoopla of a new brand being launced, and when the Japanese decided to truly enter the game I was most interested. I digress, every Lexus dealership has to be a stand alone affair, it's written into their agreement. In the Chicago area, there are a few Toyota/Lexus combos, but they have seperate sales, service, everything, though many times the Lexus store is only a short walk down the same sidewalk. I dont' know if this has been changed (which I doubt), but anyone wanting a Lexus franchise must provide ""exclusive"" Lexus facilities.

But I do think both should put a halt to the tuned trucks before people start killing themselves in those things. I saw an X-5 lose control on a curve in the rain last week and take out a guard rail.

bernard1,

Yep I have, but again...see what I said above. Porsche's GT2 is not for profits primarily it's to prove superiority on the track....while making a profit. The regular 911' s generate the real revenue. What you just stated about them not making a car unless it's profitable is what I stated several posts ago.

Guys, I'm not saying that profits aren't important, because they are. However the European companys are just as driven by making a hell of a car too. The Japanese tend to limit themselves to mainstream products with profits/sales being the #1 reason for their being.

ljflx,

Well who knows on that one. Some say Mercedes did take Lexus seriously in the beginning some say they didn't. I do know that Mercedes was in better shape than either BMW (no V8's at all) or Jaguar at the time to deal with Lexus. Lexus also aimed a lot higher than Acura did too. The Acura Legend of 1986 got creamed by the also new 300E at the time, so Acura didn't really aspire to be at the same level as Mercedes-Benz. They didn't truly have a real ""luxury"" car until the second generation Legend came in 1991. The first generation legend was barely a step up from a Maxima at the time. Hardly at the level of the first LS400.

M"
1369,"March 26, 2002 6:42AM",bobbyknight,"I hear what your saying and agree with you. If audi was all about profits and sales they would bring over the A3 than produce and certify 500-1000 RS6's.

Acura did the exact same thing to the established luxury marques that lexus did. When the legend came out in 1986, it was just as good as the 300E for almost half the price. Do you guys realize that a late '80s, early '90s 300E was going close to 50K when new? That's amazing! BTW, if you think the '86 legend was anything like a '86 Maxima, I want you to go back and take a look at some Maxima pictures. Also, Acura had the best dealers and customer service at the time."
1370,"March 26, 2002 8:48AM",merc1,"I seem to remember a comaparison between the 300E, STS and Legend, the 300E easily walked away from them both.

I did say Acura did the same thing as Lexus, but they clearly didn't aim as high.

You're right about the 300E, the 1993 model was $49,900, with far less equipment than today's $49,115 E320. That is amazing. I was just thinking, the 1990 500SL debuted at $83,500 and the 2003 SL500 is only $86,665.

The 400E had a price of (Gasp!)61K if I can remember correctly. It would be difficult to option out a E430 to be that much. That IS amazing. Since MB had no competition back in the late '90s they could charge whatever they wanted for their cars and I'm sure they were raking in the profits.

MB reduced their prices, eliminated most of the bargaining from list price and reduced the quality. Check out BMW, some of there list prices exceed the price of competing model from MB. Lexus forced MB to reduce their price but has had very little effect on BMW. In the late 90's a S500 was about 88K with increases each year. How many cars were they going to sell when those cars hit 100K. They had to reduce their price and still they are about 15K more than the Lexus. Also as the quality has come down, lots of MB owners moved to BMW who's quality was goin up.

No, the X5 is not supposed to be an ""off road"" Vehicle. The X5 was made to generate additional profits. BMW offers an SAV, emphasis on sport, AWD for light snow, and better traction. It does out handle (on road) the other SUV's and is more fun to drive. It is short on off road abilities and space so we don't expect it to compete with our LX.

Porsche admits the Cayenne is to do the same and keep them independent. In fact the first year's production of the Cayenne will be 1/3 of their total auto production for the year. With plans to expand to 50% of their total auto production within 2 yrs.

merc1 - Porsche has decided that they will produce their new super car. But that decision wasn't made until they received X amount of committed orders to insure they made money. Porsche didn't hide this fact, they said up front, no orders no car. Don't get me wrong, I love the cars that are perfomance based, but if there were no profits to be had, those perfomance cars would not be made in todays market even if it does bring braging rights. In the past, it was about the cars but most of those makers are out of business or have sold out to larger firms like GM, Fiat and Ford.

BMW doesn't sell many M5's but they have sold every one they can produce and the profit margin on the M5 is more than that of a 530i or 540i."
1374,"March 26, 2002 4:54PM",bobbyknight,"Of course Lexus got BMW's attention. That's why for 1993 they brought out the 740 for 735 money (which by the way was 400E money). The 7-series was considerably more car than the 400E, yet the pricing was similar. This proves that MB's pricing was out of control. Pricing for the 5-series has grown little to it's present version, along with the present E-Class.

There is no doubt that MB in the late 80s and early 90s had HUGE profit margins on their cars. For 1994, MB reduced the pricing for their E-Class by 10K, and the cars were essentially the same.

You're right, the X5 is not an off-road vehicle, but essentially an any-road vehicle. I still don't understand the point of the X5 other than to generate profits. The Cayenne is going to totally tarnish Porsche's image, plus will be a huge failure once the hype dies down. Serves them right if you ask me."
1375,"March 26, 2002 6:21PM",bernard1,"Yep the X5 was to just generate profits. But it is fun to drive and works in the snow. It's still a debate if the Cayenne is going to tarnish the Porsche image but I have a feeling it will sell if they price it right.

I'm looking forward to a new Audi S8. I will probably not buy another S class. I didn't have any problems with my previous ones but the news do not seem to offer that vault like substance. If Audi produces a technology leading S8 with a new budy style and maintain the AWD, I'll put it my garage instead of that 745il.

I don't know if Lexus got BMW's attention when it comes to pricing. BMW is selling perfomance which they have no problems telling the world that Lexus can't match them. The 740 is BMW's answer to the S, and they maintained about the same distance in price below the S with the 740 as they did with the 735. Not to mention they stayed about the same $$ above Lexus. In fact in 1993 the LS was still considered ""near luxury"" and were not an honest threat to MB or BMW. The LS was bearly 3 yrs old.

In the service area, Lexus made them both take notice. Both MB and BMW have improved and offers full maintenance warranties where Lexus doesn't anymore.

Lexus has done a great job I just wish they would work on a fresh idea for the exterior of the LS.

1376,"March 26, 2002 7:58PM",ljflx,"If I remember right the LS400 was originally viewed as competition to the E-420/430.

All you had to do was put an x and list any other cars you also may have looked at. It was the 98 model that started the push to compete with the S and the 2001 that really accelerated it further.

In the bull market of the 90's many people would have been able to afford $100k S-500's. MB had to do something with price, not so much because it was getting too high but because of the big economic difference it had to cars that were winning such high reliability scores and renewing virtually every customer on a new car purchase. If Lexus isn't there MB does not cut prices. The price/value today vs. 1990 is all due to competition. Does anyone really think otherwise?"

The LS400 offered the horsepower and luxury of a 560SEL for much less than an E-CLass. Kind of makes you wonder what the MB executives were thinking in 1990!

bernard: BMW's didn't have the same pricing problem as MB did when the Japanese duo came out. A BMW 525i was still reasonably priced compared to it's eqivalent MB. The 5-series was priced similar to the smaller and less powerful 190E 2.6. Lexus and Infiniti did have an impact on the product, V8s became the norm for the 5 and 7 series not long after lexus entered the picture.

The Japanese wouldn't see the point of a car like a M5 or Carrera GT, though they have the ability to produce such cars. I would doubt that about the profit margin on the M5, because a loaded 540i is only 10K less, the M5's engine is way more expensive to build than the 540i's. I would think they make more money on a loaded 530i or 525i.

bobbyknight,

Yep the 400E was hugely expensive, the 500E (probably my favorite 4-door Benz of all time) was $80K at the time. The 400E was just a stopgap effort to compete with the LS400 of the time. The W124 chassis was an expensive one, and you could tell....even GM admitted that is was the most solid car built during it's day. These cars are still reguarded by many Benz fans as the best ""E"" Mercedes ever made. I can't take a definite stance on that opinion, though I think the current W210 E is not as well made structurally or in some of the cabin materials.

Yes Lexus did force the value issue, MB lowered prices in 1994 for the first time in over 100+ years of carmaking. Monumental change indeed. BMW has had performance as their isolation from Lexus, many still don't cross shop the two for this very reason. Mercedes' cars philosphy wise sit in the middle of the two, the most difficult place to be.

It wasn't so much that BMW chose their isolation from lexus in that Lexus chose MB as their benchmark.

I might have to agree with you on the margins of the M5 compared to a loaded 540i, that 5 liter is full of expensive technology but I'm sure that engine doesn't cost BMW 10K more to produce."
1381,"March 27, 2002 9:16AM",merc1,"Yes it was an incredible car! Yep it was built/tested/tweaked by Porsche. Automobile called it the best car in the world ""by which we will judge all automobiles"". If I didn't need a ""new"" car this would be the used Benz of choice, a 1994 model (E500) that is.

True about Lexus and their benchmark target, that's another way of putting it. But you have to admit that BMW's performance angle has spared them direct comparisions with Lexus until the GS400 came along.

Not really sure about the M5 compared to the other 5-series cars. I suspect that type of info isn't available on the web anywhere.

1382,"March 27, 2002 1:28PM",bernard1,"Maybe I'm missing the point but from what I remember the Japanesse makes a little low sales volume sports car by Acura, Yes? So, they also make cars that are performace based while full well knowing the volume of sales for that car will be low. In 1970 the first Z car hit the US shores, and that was also a fun performance oriented car and it came at a time when no one would have thought Japan would have produced a sports car. They took the risk. Europeans make certain cars for perfomance sake, what II'm saying is hat today it's all about profit. Since I have perfomance based cars I'm glad they do. I use Porsche as my gauge as they make more $$ per auto then any other manufacturer and they are not always ahead of their competition.

I think you may have missed my point about the GT. Sure orders= cars, but rarely has a car company stated that they would not build a car unless they had confirmed orders to insure a profit. The Cayenne, Porsche's new love was designed, engineered and ready to be built before the first order was taken. Most manufactures do the same. I'm just pointing out that while the Europeans believe in perfomance based auto's, profit are now the prime motavator, having the fastest car, etc. etc, is icing on the cake.

Actually a fully loaded 540i 6 sp is 12K and change less than a fully loaded M5 and when you actually purchase it, the difference is even more as you can get reasonable discounts on the 540i. Additionally there is not 12K difference in price on the engine. Something else to consider, very few people buy a fully loaded 540 simply because they don't want some of the extras. Those extras bring profit, the M5 comes with most everything standard, so there is a little extra built in.

You are correct about BMW not having to deal head to head with Lexus until the GS400 came along . Can't speak of the pricing of the 525 vs 190 as I've never owned or even price one of those. Lexus may have had some influence on the V8's at BMW, I don't know, but I know that the 7 series came out as their MB fighter but was deemed under powered."
1383,"March 27, 2002 1:55PM",bobbyknight,"I think you guys are both right. Sure, every manufacturer is out to make profits, but BMW, Porsche, Audi, Acura, etc. also cater to the consumer by bringing out low volume performance cars. They could aways sell something else to make more profit like bringing the Audi A3 over instead of the RS6(which they are bringing over only 850 units). On the flipside, if manufacturers didn't care about profits then they would be giving cars away. Its not all about profits, its also about giving the consumer what they want."
1384,"March 27, 2002 5:16PM",bernard1,"Your're right. I sure wish Porsche would listen and give a little more hp for the $$.

1387,"March 27, 2002 7:18PM",merc1,"I'd have to disagree about the Acura NSX, the car is rare because it's 10+ years old and just doesn't sell. Acura has stated many times that they would love to import more of these. The NSX sold very well between 1991-1993, but after that it's been downhill. I'ts not a rare car by choice.

Well I guess we'll never know about the profit margins on the 5-Series BMW models, but It really doesn't matter what the buyer gets the car for, the only money BMW sees is the money the dealer pays to get the car. I still think the M5's engine eats up more profit on the M5 than the 525i's does. But you/me/we don't have any proof anyway, but it would interesting to find out.

On the Porsche Carrera GT. Cars are shown to the public to gauge reaction all the time and companys often base their production plans on who many orders or inquirys they get on a car, so I don't know what you mean there. Ford just did the same thing with the GT40.

I'm impressed with BMW and Mercedes' push for technology. The only thing really ""wrong"" with the new 7-Series is the styling. BMW really is rethinking engine and suspension design, I like that. Mercedes has been all about brakes and suspensions lately, I waiting to see their next generation of direct injection, 4-valve gas engines, due in 2004, I think. I think idrive may be a little ahead of it's time, hopefully they won't make it standard on the next 5-Series. Mercedes is turning over development of the next Comand system to Nokia. Should be interesting, though I've never had a Nokia phone (Sanyo) to know how they think. BMW hit MB with pricing like Lexus did, just one year though....the 525i was priced at $34,900, that same as the 190E 2.6.

Merc1 - I'm not too impressed with the 7's styling either but as most thing do, I believe it grows on us. The new 5's will have the basic same style as the 7, don't know about the Idrive but I think BMW is pushing for a standard. Remember with the E-class fist came out with oval headlights? For MB that was a major departure and created a stir. After awhile most people loved it and the E is the most successful selling car in it's class ever.

1395,"April 11, 2002 5:01AM",nealm1,"Had my first real chance to look at the 7 in person last weekend (2 actually, a silver and a black). I still haven't driven, or even been inside, the car, so true evaluation wil have to wait.

My impressions on styling alone? I am wildly ambivalent about this car. The interior is orders of magnitude better looking than the prior 7, which (unlike the elegant exterior) had become hopelessly dated. I really like the apparent (deceptive?) simplicity of the design. The cost paid for that (idrive) may well be too high, but the look is an enormous improvement. Much nicer, IMHO, than the S or the A8, and on par with the Lexus, although in an entirely different, more extroverted style.

Outside, the side aspect is graceful and satisfying, if a bit derivative of the 6, the passat, and a handful of other german sedans. Nothing new or breathtaking, but certainly no turn off. (I still don't know what they were thinking with the crease running through the doors, though) The front of the car -- even with the busy grill/light clusters -- does not bother me in person the way it did in print. I could certainly learn to live with it (as I have the questionable design of the LS430 headlights).

The rear, as many here have said, is an entirely different matter. Dark colors, light colors, in person or in a mag, it is just plain ugly. There are so many ideas and design elements competing for attention that it becomes a jumbled mess. I have said before, and this in-person inspection confirmed, that it looks as if the rear quarters and trunk were assembled from spare parts from 6 different model years of the same car; all the pieces fit mechanically but don't look as if they came from the same car. I don't think I would ever get used to that, and would not buy the car for that reason alone (although I suspect that I would not like idrive, and that would probably keep me from buying anyway).

My guess is that they are aggressively working as we speak on a facelift for the rear, to bow next year or the year after. I also guess that they will try to find a way to make idrive an option before too long. I hope I am right on both (and I hope the car proves reliable), since I would like to be able to consider the car when I am ready to trade out of the LS430."
1396,"April 11, 2002 11:32AM",pathdoc,"I have driven the car and find the major problem not the iDrive or the appearance but rather the shifter. I enjoy using the shifter and the new steering column mounted device on the 745i is terrible. Since steptronic isn't offer in the US (in order to avoid gas guzzler tax) it precludes shifting up and down as indicated. This seems strange in the ""ultimate DRIVING machine"". Supposedly it will be available in the sport model when it is available. I hope so because otherwise it is a very impressive drive."

My point was that the 745 has problems, at a price point nearly double a C320, and it is not pretty. I put up with a lot of repairs on 7s before because I love the look AND the driving experience. Take one attribute away and the car is much less appealing to me, the flaws are harder to forgive."

Quattro in snow is unbelievable. My previous car was a 1998 4Runner and the A4 is better in the snow than the Toyota was. The only drawback in bad snow is less ground clearance, but that wasn't a problem this winter.

If I could have any car right now (under $45k), it would be an A6 2.7T with a manual tranny. Either that or an S4. I think Audi has some of the best looking cars (subjective, I know), with beautiful interiors and gives you a lot of bang for your buck."

After spending several months testing and researching Lexus, BMW, MB, Audi and others I felt the C320 gave me the handling I felt the ES lacked but a better interior and features than most others (especially MB) - in short a good compromise for what I was looking for.

However after putting my money down I had to wait and wait for delivery. While waiting I reread the boards (see the C class board here on Edmunds) and saw all the problems.

So I went back to my alternatives. By then the new ES300 was out. It was better but still too much like my old ES. The dealer had a new early production 2001 LS430 that they had priced to sell as the 2002s were arriving. I had not considered it up until then as I thought it was out of my price range. However, after driving, and appreciating the car and Lexus quality control even more due to the C320 problems and as the cost was not such a huge jump after the no-haggle price I had settled for on the fully-optioned C320, I bought."
1412,"April 17, 2002 6:00PM",edarte,"While I was in the process of buying a C320 I spent most of my time on the C class board here on Edmunds. I will try and paste a link here:

sysop ""Mercedes-Benz C-Class (Sedans Board)"" Apr 17, 2002 3:09pm

Before I decided to buy I read every post on that board from the beginning (there are now over 5000 posts). I saw there were some problems but I too assumed that they were teething problems and would go away. When they continued I pushed my order out to the second production year. Then, after waiting for three more months for delivery I had enough time to see that the problems were still far too frequent for me so I bailed.

The problem posts started to appear around Nov 2000 and continue to today. I am amazed that so few appear on the MBZ site now as they were there last October when I last spent any time there.

There have been problems with (purge valves, electronic keys, seats breaking, trim falling off, trunks-doors-sunroofs not opening, engines stalling, doors not sealing and others). And these are not one offs, many posters had the same problem.

Now not all the posts are negative but I think a conservative estimate is that 1 in 5 (while I was active)deals with a problem. And this is well into the second year of production. I waited through the first year for the problems to go away but they are still occurring.

And if you read a recent post of mine you will see I ended up buying a 2001 LS430 (first year of production) and the only problem I have had is that the Automatic Sound Level control had to be corrected. So I don't accept that poor quality is a given on a new production vehicle - Lexus has proven otherwise.

I was at first very disappointed in having to pass on the C320. I think it has great styling, handling and a lot of potential. But my experience has made me believe the news articles I read that state MB has fallen recently from 3rd to 10th in automotive quality control.

And some may say that all those who post their C problems are over-represented on the site because they want to solve/share their problem. But I think you would be hard pressed to read about so many problems with one model on any other board."

A C320 could be the best built car in the world, it still wouldn't compare with a LS430, nor is it supposed to. One is much larger, has a V8 and way more features. It would be like test driving a S500 and C320, no comparison.

1415,"April 18, 2002 5:58PM",edarte,"But in my case I started and had committed to the MB C320. I really liked the car. But there were (and still are) too many problems with it for me. So then after rejecting the C320 I started to shop around and eventually went with the LS430.

I am not saying they are in similar types of cars. The C320 being a very sporty, entry level low-end luxury car. The LS is much bigger, not as sporty, high end luxury car (IMO). But the LS gave me much more than I started out looking for in most areas (and a little less in the sport area). But the relatively small difference in cost was worth it.

And the original purpose of my post was to respond to the person (who I believe is a MB fan) who did not think any other car company would introduce a new model with as many problems as BMW has done with the recent 7. I think the C situation disproves this.

It is true, considering the price differences, one should not expect the same level of refinement in a C320 as a 7 series. However, I think MB has a problem on its hands if the C is an attempt to win over customers who will go on to buy other, more expensive models.

1417,"April 19, 2002 5:20AM",v12power,"I went back and read through the last 60 or so posts on the C-class topic. Part of the discussion was about how the cars are not nearly as bad as the board makes them sound. I think Merc1 is right, there are a few vocal posters with problems. They all sounded like resolvable issues. I have to wonder if as C-class buyers they were coming from Japanese brands? There is undoubtably a gap between the two. The difference is with the MB you get a better driving car, a better looking car, a safer car, and without a doubt in my mind a car that will hold up better in the long run. If you want to minimize your dealer visits, the Lexus is better. Consider that the MB maint is paid for 3-4 years, at Lexus you pay for everything.

I personally didn't see anything in the C topic that would have stopped me from buying one. Consider this, I pulled a service history on my 45k mile '98 BMW. How about 19 visits to the dealer for service work since new. Only five of those are scheduled events, the rest are repairs. My '95 had that many in the year I owned it. I love the way they drive, I love the way they look. I could have bought Lexus, but I wouldn't enjoy the car. Others get the most enjoyment from not having to see their dealers at all. Different strokes."
1418,"April 19, 2002 7:57PM",edarte,"I accept that it is possible that recently the problems on the C are being reduced, I have not taken the time to examine this. If they are reduced, I think this should have happened by the end of the first production year. We are talking abut MB here not Kia or some other low cost brand. (The C may be low cost by MB standards but it is not low cost compared to most cars.)

But back in October 2001 if you were considering the C, as I was, you would have seen that there were problems serious enough to have many of the same cars in the shop multiple times in a month. And this was into the second year of production.

There were theories going around that, because many of the Cs were being asembled in Brazil and other places, maybe the quality was dropping.

But for me, ""coming from a Japanese brand"" (i.e., accustomed to reliability) I did not want to pay more money for a car that, granted, had good style and handling,(safer is debatable and only time will tell if MB continues to last longer) but spent too much time in the shop; so I stayed with Lexus.

And I could have bought a MB but I would not have enjoyed the ""lack of a car"".

And I, like I suspect, many Lexus owners, could have bought much more expensive MB models - we just don't necessarily equate more expensive with better (even if it does give you the opportunity to become very close friends with your dealer service manager).

It appears to be true that you don't see your dealer as much with a Lexus but that is only one of its many virtues.

Yes, some of the posters claim that the cars are not as bad as the other posts make them appear. It is true it is hard to get a representative sample form these posts. My point is that ""relative to other boards"" there is a disproportionate number of negative posts. And for a car manufactured by a company that has a (past, at least) reputation of high quality.

I suppose you can consider all the C problems as resolvable - if you read the posts you will see that some of these ""resolved problems"" involved the customer swapping their C for an E model!

Again, my original reason for posting was to challenge the comment that no other car company would introduce a new model with as many problems as BMW's new 7 series - I suggest that MB may be just as guilty, or worse with the C.

I have rambled enough on this topic so I will stop now and let you have the last word."

V-12power - The Lexus is very safe and given the 90-95 models I see on the road probably holds up as well if not better than the S-class of the same period. The car is extremely satisfying, at the top of the shelf in luxury, has the best service by far from dealers and the company and dealer network make you feel like royalty. It has a great ride and more than adequate handling. I could easily have written a check for an S-600. But I don't prefer to spend that much money on a car. Seriously considered the S-500 (as did many of us on the LS board) but found the LS430 better for my tastes. Money was not the issue. I prefer the LS430 for its virtues which are many and all of which are important to me. The fact that it rarely needs service is wonderful and important to me but the primnary reason to buy are its luxury appointments, phenomenal ride and serene quiet cabin. You seem to live in a surburban area where you may find yourself alone at the wheel and can get a bit free on empty highways. In the big city areas that is very rare. And it is in the big cities where 80% of these cars are sold. Besides the LS430 makes 0-60 in 6.3 seconds so it is hardly a slouch. I always see a high proportion of 7, S-class and LS owners driving conservatively. A few, like me drive pretty fast but they brake pretty quickly on turns - so as I've said many times before - the handling may be there, particularly on the 7 but it doesn't seem to be used by this class of buyers. Nothing personal or mischevious intended here - I just don't think you really know the reasons LS people choose their cars."

1421,"April 20, 2002 7:27AM",ljflx,"I had an interesting return drive home from JFK last week went I went to London. It was a first for me. The limo driver who picked me up had an S-430 that he just picked up two weeks earlier. Never had an S-class limo before but the guy who owned it said the superlux cars are starting to sell as limos particularly MB and Lexus because of reliability and durability. Anyway I got to experience the ride for about an hour and a half from the back seat. Very good ride but definitely not as smooth or quiet as an LS430. But by no means is it not quiet or smooth. One major advantage the S has is the extra rear seat stretch room. From a driver standpoint it's irrelevant but for someone who has to get a child out of a baby seat the extra space is nice. Now I can sit very comfortably in the rear of the LS430 (I'm 6ft) with the front seat at its maximum depth. Plenty of space for my legs even if it was possible to move the front seat even further back. But I can't stretch the way you do in an S. I would think at some point Lexus has to go to 199-202 inches.

By the way the driver lives in the next town over from me. Needless to say I'll use him whenever I travel which thankfully is a lot less than in the past. Without question a great car but I still prefer the LS430.

Last thing - I noticed many more LS400/430's on the road in London than in the past. They must be penetrating the market there now. I also see that they still make the S-320 in the new style in Europe. I've also come to appreciate that an S-class with tinted glass is much more striking than one without it. I think as DVD players become standard or part of option packages in the future we'll see cars all such cars have the tinted windows direct from the factory, which is the only way I would want them."
1422,"April 20, 2002 8:44AM",v12power,"I have a pretty good handle on why people buy the Lexus. I certainly do not mean to infer they could not afford the S-class, though in some cases that is true. Witness the poster going from a C class back to a Lexus LS430, I doubt the S500-600 were real considerations. The value of the LS430 is undeniable.

You acurately describe why many chose the LS430. They do not drive in an enviroment where the added capabilities of say and S600 would be noticable or worth the added expense. Dealer service is the best, no dispute there. Beyond that everybody has their own priorities on car buying. I can see/feel/hear the differences in my 750 and 600 vs the Ls430. I am willing to pay more for the cars to get that advantage. It is just one of my priorities. I am also going to become a Ferrari owner soon. Not much point in that either, a new Vette has all of the performance. But it lacks some of the feel, heritage and mystique, all things many find foolish, but things I am willing to pay for. I can't fault anyone for buying a Lexus, they just are not for me. It is not for a lack of trying either. I have looked at every new LS since their inception, more than once in all cases. It is just not me. My mother in law still has her '94 SC400, it has 120k miles on it with very few problems and great service from the dealer. She will probably replace it with a RX300, a car I think is a joke. She will not waver from Lexus, and who can blame her. Still the styling and general feel of the cars does not appeal to me at any price."

1424,"April 20, 2002 9:36PM",merc1,"Well you know the European market enjoys quite a few more S-Class variants than we get here. There is a S320 V6 and a S400 V8 direct-injection turbo diesel that is really a torque monster. I don't particularly like the new S-Class in limo form, the previous model had a much bettter body structure to begin with and it looked better stretched. Nevertheless, there are S500 and S600 Pullman models in Europe too. We do get the S500 Guard here though for a mere 150K. I've actually seen 2 since they've been on sale here. Thats one of the things I like about Mercedes is the diversity of their model lineup; trucks, taxis, limos, dump trucks, Unimogs, vans, 2 two-seat convertibles, 4-seat convertibles, a modern SUV, an old-school SUV, big coupes, little coupes, mid-sized coupes, they have it all. They're the only company in the world that can make turn out one bodystyle in both taxicab form and at the same time produce a hi-po variant (AMG) all the while having some of the highest prestige and one of the images worldwide.

I think there is a rule in Japan about their cars being a certain length in order to avoid taxes or something like that. Thats another reason why Lexus went to such a tall body in order to get the most room from the least amount of space on the outside.

1425,"April 22, 2002 6:20PM",ljflx,"It wasn't a stretch limo just your base S-class. What surprised me was the driver telling me that base S-class cars and LS430's are becoming the choice for some limo drivers. I would have thought the cost too high but I guess the durability evens things out in the long run. But even the base S allows for good stretchability in the rear for your legs. By the way having ridden in the rear of an A-8L pretty often I would honestly say the S blows it away. But you know what my favorite car still is.

They're giving you a hard time on the S-class board. You need to put out the fire - but in a nice way."

1427,"April 23, 2002 7:16PM",ljflx,"No. You got it backwards. I said the S blows away the A-8. I've driven both and I've been in the rear seat of both now. I like the styling of the A-8L but you see it will always come down to a Lexus LS vs the MB S for me. Both companies make the cars I prefer over anything else. Great ride, luxurious and quiet. And if I go the more sporting route it will be the SC vs. the SL. Man I love both of those cars.

By the way the A-8 doesnt't seem to be all that reliable."

1432,"May 8, 2002 10:54AM",jefftp,"I have never been in a modern era Mercedes (while it was moving, anyway), so cannot speak on that. As for the reliability of the Lexus, however, one experience comes to mind:
I recently bought a 4-year old LS400 from a Lexus dealer. Lexus gives your car an extended 3 year bumper-to-bumper ""certified pre-owned' warranty. The dealer then offered to add two years to that warranty for $1,400. This means for $1,400 I can have a car with a bumper to bumper warranty up through nine years of age. I feel safe in saying that BMW would never consider doing anything like that, because the major repairs would eat their lunch."
1433,"May 9, 2002 6:06AM",v12power,"BMW does offer extended warranties. They have a program called Certified Pre Owned(CPO). As long as the car is sold through a dealer and is within the original warranty period the car is eligible. It extends the warranty to 6 yrs, 100k miles. I have it on my BMW, wouldn't be without.

ljflx, My wife seems to agree with you. The 750 hasn't left the garage in a week or so. She seems to have grown roots in the S600. I can't blame her. The 750 is a great machine but, the S is so much more. It is faster, quieter and has more usable luxo features. Of course the 7 debuted in '95 and the S in 2000. It is amazing how fast things change these days."

1435,"May 10, 2002 6:17PM",v12power,"The honest answer is, I dunno yet. I do know that it rides better than our 750 with 18"" wheels and 45/50 series tires. The 600 is on 255/35s. I have winter tires in the stock 225/55-17 size but they have never been on the car. I accidentally hit a major pothole with the 600 a few days ago. Hard enough that I was sure I damaged the rim. Those Brabus rims must be awfully tough, there was absolutely no damage. They work just fine for my driving. We do not venture into the big city much, that is where the big potholes seem to live. I might be a little leery if I did have to make a metro type commute daily. We did make a 2400 miles drive home in it over all sorts of roads. The ride was great. I think the low profile tires give the car the handling edge it needs to satisfy me like the bimmer has."
1436,"May 26, 2002 10:38AM",ljflx,"Anyone ever notice the games manufacturers play with leasing deals and how they use disconting through the lease rather than the msrp. A friend of mine is interested in a new Q and asked me to check lease deals he has received. That led me to check today's NY Times auto section and I found a couple of interesting deals.

One deal is for a $52.3k Q which you can buy for $50k or lease for $639 per month for 39 months with $3k down. I then wandered looking for another Q deal and I came across a 745I which you can buy for $71k or lease for $849 per month for 36 months also with $3k down. The same add offered an X5 V8 for $54,300 or lease it at $699 per month for 36 months but with $4k down. All are 10k miles per year and BMW throws in the free maintenance. These are all deals through the Mfrs. so clearly sponsored programs.

Now I applied some math to this and I found that while the Q is discounted $2300 it actually costs more relative to MSRP (on a lease deal) than does the 7. The Q sells for 70% of the 7's price but its' lease is 75% of the 7's lease price plus 3 extra months. The X-5's lease is an additional $1k down and while it sells at 76% of the 7's price it leases at 82% of the 7's lease price and this is in the same family. Interesting. It would seem the 7 is set-up for leasing and BMW is taking a big chance on residuals. Infiniti with the Q - so heavily criticized for discounting - is taking no such risk. The X-5 is hard to understand. Here BMW seems to be betting on a lower residual relative to the 7 even though the truck is hot now thus you are paying the higher price. Thus they are taking no risk and letting the buyer pay in the same way as Infiniti.

Another interesting item is the total cost. The Infiniti's all in cost after 39 months is $57,211 (3000+24921+29290 residual) which is is 115% of the $50k sale price. The 7 is $79,000 (3000+30564+45437 residual) which is 111% of sale price and the X-5 is $62,284 (4000+25164+33120 residual) which is 114% of sale price. Infiniti is certainly holding up a lot better than anyone would think looking at the real TMV vs. MSRP prices on Edmunds. Remember that the TMV becomes that $50k and not the $52k the way Edmunds does it. Lexus and MB don't seem to ever advertise lease deals (except the IS300 and the C) anymore so I couldn't bring them in.

With BMW taking the risk on the 7 this is certainly not a car to buy but one to lease and decide on in 3 years. Look at the factors. If you assume you can get 5% interest return (treasuries are yielding more than this) on your money now then a compound interest factor on $71,000 means you are paying $82.2k for a car that you can lease and then buy for $79k (plus maybe a $500 application fee). And if you think you can better the 5%......."

The British government is doing things for their cars, now at least. Recently, they paid something like $69 million to the Premiere Auto Group to continue to keep production of Jaguar models exclusively in England, and they did the same for Aston Martin, but I don't know how much they paid for it. I also don't know why you'd harbor ill-feelings towards Volkswagen AG for owning Bentley, as there would be no more Bentley had VW done nothing.

""After I red Sweet Js post again, I wonder if he isn't under the impression that BMW is a British company, not German.""

What? If anyone know anything about automaker's would know the origin by now. Since BMW owns Mini and Royce Royce (have control next year), BMW being full-blooded German is far-fetched nowadays. Just about everyone is being owned by someone or partnered with another automaker across the Atlantic and neighboring countries so saying BMW is full German is yesterday's news. Is the X5 and Z3 German cars? No, they are American made so you can call them German-American domestic.

BMW not 100% German like they use to be until they start making cars here and owned smaller car companies. Chrysler is not 100% American after they produce cars in Germany with the Crossfire in 2003.

He led me to believe that some cars are built in S. America.
1460,"June 4, 2002 9:01PM",jagboyxkr,"Lots of BMW 3-Series are built in South Africa, I think. Others are built in Germany. The Z3 Roadster is built in Spartanburg, South Carolina, one of those ""known US factories"". Volkswagen's Jetta and some of its other cars I believe are built in Mexico, along with the original Beetle - a hot seller over there. It is funny to note that it sometimes takes less money to build cars and their parts and then pay to ship them to other locations than it does to build them where you sell them!"
1461,"June 4, 2002 10:16PM",merc1,"Yes some of that is true. A percentage of C-Class cars are built outside of Germany for U.S. consumption. The CL, S, E and CLK for U.S. consumption are built in Germany. Now parts I'm not sure on, they could come from anywhere. I do know that MB has operations in South America and South Africa and some on the C-Class boards have indicated that they wouldn't buy a C unless it was made in Germany. Whether or not that resulted in better quality I'm not sure. Some E-Classes are built in China from knock-down kits, but only for the Chinese market.

On a different note, I really don't care where they build the 2003 E, cause me in love all over again(!):

1467,"June 8, 2002 3:25PM",magnetophone,"actually those were near-entry-luxury, Bill--

this is an example of the original Lexus LS400, which was basically a cheaper Japanese Mercedes."
1468,"June 8, 2002 6:45PM",ljflx,"Lexus was a separate name, with exemplary service and a soft sell approach. Dealer showrooms were different and luxurious to begin with, making the buying experience very different than buying a Toyota. The original LS400 rode and acted like a very luxurious car - it was only the pricing that put it in the near lux category. The VW approach is to keep it under the same badge. VW's car is the ""people's car"" and the brand recognition tied to that is your everyday average car. I doubt Lexus would have made it if you had to buy an LS400 in the same showroom as a Corolla.

In Europe people pay for status. They'll pass on a value deal and overpay for a name with status, even if the status car is arguably a lesser car. I think VW loses on both continents. Besides that I'll never understand why they are trying to undercut Audi to begin with. Can you imagine Toyota coming out with a car that would compete with a GS430 or LS430. Even the TLC is probably going to bite the dust, or change markedly because of the LX470. Can you imagine MB creating a Chrysler to compete with an E or S Class. The strategy makes no sense whatsoever. Audi, with a much more respected brand image can't sell 2500 A-8's in this country on an annual basis in the first place. I also agree with bentwoodvolvo - it looks like a nearlux car rather than a true lux car. A European Acura at best."
1469,"June 8, 2002 10:04PM",merc1,"The Phaeton doesn't look like a luxury car? Interesting considering how style-less so called Japanese ""luxury"" cars are.

I think the car will meet will *some* success here due to it being a good product first, and if Automobile Mag is right about the price, a 12-cylinder car for 62K is an awesome concept. I agree with those who think this big VW is going to hurt Audi. If I can get a Phaeton W12 for 62K why would I pay 75K for a Audi A8 with only ""8"" cylinders? Very true. I don't think VW is really going to make much fuss about the Phaeton here, they'll just sell what they can and leave it at that. The problem with VW's strategy is that they are seemingly trying to turn VW into a full-fledged luxury brand, that simply won't work. Now if they just want VW to be represented in every segment, thats a brilliant idea. They must not forget that the Jetta and Passat have saved them in this country, they must not ever forget that. If VW revamps their dealers, customer service practices and treats a Jetta buyer the same as they would a Phaeton buyer their idea/concept would be realized.

I don't doubt for a min that it'll be a hit in Europe, but here it's the VW dealer that will hinder the car, more so than the car's price. But yes it does put Audi in a very tough position.

That same issue of Automobile has an article on that very question. In short all the big dogs are in a peeing contest. Like any other competitive outbreak the consumer wins, but now insert the word >rich< in front of consumer. Between Maybach, BMW's New RR01 Rolls-Royce, Bugatti, and VW's new Bentley's the super rich are going to loose their minds trying to decide on which one.

1471,"June 9, 2002 7:12AM",ljflx,"Yeah - I saw that and it was a good story. But apparently automobile felt the same way as me. In the case of MB it puts a cap on them and eventually the Maybachs and that group of cars will lower price to grow. Give it 5 years or so before that happens. What I really question is why introduce a loss leader when you already have a successful brand. Loss leaders pave the way, they don't trail success that's already happened. Anyway that's just a business case. I think what really happened is MB couldn't resist the concept once someone proposed it. By the way even though the article said the sector would double or triple in 5 years, that type of growth in such a tiny sector would have minimal impact on the financials of the company even if it were highly profitable.

I disagree with you on the Phaeton - I doubt it will cut it in Europe or have sustaining power."

But, unlike the 7, it's certainly not going to turn people off. It's still a great looking car, but until I really see it my first impression is I like today's model better.

The next S-Class is years off, the current S is just about to get it's first face lift this fall. I'd wait until the actual car is shown before drawing styling conclusions on it.

As for the comparisons on cars I can see why you would think the Avalon and LS430 have similar looks but the Avalon lacks the grace and stately looks of the LS. Inside there is no comparison. I also wouldn't say the Avalon looks like the old S which is what the LS430 is accused of copying by yourself and others.

As for that 2006 (assuming that sketch is a good one) and even the current S, I simply think that as a car tends to a more sporty look, and away from a stately look, they are going into a class of design concepts where it will look like designs of other cars or vice-versa. It's just natural. That Ford five hundred and that S sketch look alike in the pictures to me though I'm sure the S will have a more massive look in person. I also think MB has to be careful here because the older richer buyer prefers a stately look to a sporty look. Some of these design concepts are aimed toward the younger rich crowd but with the Wall street boom over and the easy money days past that buyer may not be plentiful.

Lastly - the post Ejerod made on the S-class board is exactly what I feared would happen to me if I chose the S over the LS430. He's a lot more forgiving than I would have been. They definitely have to correct these problems. Did you also see the article on the 7 on that board. Scary - if you're a BMW fan."

The current car already broke away from years and years of upright, stodgy design and it's the best seller in the class worldwide, and still sells well in the U.S. The 2003 face-lift will only enhance it's following. The current car is to me the best looking large sedan on the road, especially in AMG guise.

Yes I read Ejerod's post. But he did buy another S-Class. I find that most interesting.

Yes I am BMW fan (German car nut period), but it pains me to say that I just can't bring myself to like the 7-Series. Remember the styling test I told you about? Well the BMW 7 failed it categorically. The car is extremely well made, brings new stunning engine and suspension technology to the table, but is as ugly as all getout. BMW was oh so close to having true category buster as everyone likes to say they have nowadays. One ugly car is almost unexcusable, but man if the copy this look to the 5 and 3 Series cars BMW is done.

1477,"June 13, 2002 4:49AM",ljflx,"So why are they planning on copying the 7 knowing the heavy criticism they are getting? From what I've read the 7 isn't selling well at all. The pix os the new 5 I've seen look awful. In that design they chose you need to lengthen the car for it to have a chance to look decent. The Li does look a tad (just a tad) better then the i. But as you go to the smaller 5 and 3 the car will look uglier still. This design does not grow on you at all, and in fact looks worse to me the more I see it, which is not very often.

Jaguar must be one very happy camper because I'm sure that's where many 7 buyers will head."

I went to look at the Mini Cooper yesterday (cutest little thing on the road, btw), so I had to look at the 7 one more time. The saleman I talked to advised that they are back ordered for 4 months, and he may have been telling the truth, there wasn't a 7-Series to be found.

This article is really disappointing (if not exactly surprising). I was (am) rooting for the 7 to be a success, and I want them to (a) fix the car's hideous tush and (b) drop i-drive as a standard feature.

You may have seen my post on the LS board but if not I'll tell you that I saw a lot of SC430's in London last week (business not pleasure) and I was surprised at how popular they are over there. London is really a money town and it's got to be a MB bread and butter place also given the incredible amount of S-class cars you see on the road.

Somehow he looks at it and sees an elongated Lexus GS. I always saw an elongated Passat but what the heck. He's so upset about it that he wrote BMW and he also told me he probably buys out his existing car next year. He's simply not an S or LS430 fan.

Haven't seen the new Range Rover but on paper it looks pretty awesome.

Jaguars are appearing in the new James Bond film along with their cousin, the Aston Martin Vanquish. Driven by 007's arch-enemy in this film is the new face-lifted Jaguar XKR convertible. The lustrous green paint it is bathed in is a mixture of a shade of Jaguar's own green paint and pure gold! That exotic mix cost over $2,500 per litre used on the car. And all Jaguar's feature 11 coats of paint, with up to six color coats = lots of $$$ for paint! During some chase scenes, they fitted the new XKR's body onto that of a Ford Explorer's shortened platform because they did not wish to damage an actual XKR if the ice were to break and it handled ice better. The chase scene is on a frozen lake in Iceland. Over $1.7 million was spent on this XKR and its sometimes-used Explorer platform for the movie. Equipment seen on this car that will not be found in Jaguar showrooms is a rather large machine gun fitted to the rear of the car that fires over the windshield, and stylish rollover bars like those seen on many roadsters. An insider stated, the face-lift included ""lightly revised air intakes, neater light clusters and new alloys. Under the hood, the new car will be given a 4.2-liter version of the company's V-8 engine coupled to a six-speed gearbox and, in the flagship XKR model, a supercharger."" Other Jaguar models will also be included in the film.

First, her check engine light came on and the dealership, Crevier BMW, did not know why it came on so they reset it. Then the computer said the airbags were malfunctioning and now her car says it has four completely flat tires when they are all within normal PSI specs and she has had another problem which I cannot think of now. None have been as bad as experienced in her previous car, a 99 Jaguar XJ8L which blew it's transmission (I guess maybe that's why they put the Benz S-Class transmission in all the supercharged 8-cyl Jags?) at 35,000 and was in the shop another 8 times for a faulty interior, an engine fan that wouldn't turn off after the engine shut off until the battery was dead, and many many other electrical and hardware issues. However, I cannot accept that an 87 grand car has had so many issue.

Since being back in the Chicago area for the summer, I have seen a large amount of new 7's on the road, and I have to say they are beautiful. They have a very aggressive look to them.

A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to take a new 745i out for a lengthy drive and came away mostly impressed. The car I drove was a silver/black car with the ventilated comfort seats and expensive stereo package.

The I-drive, although overwhelming at first, is a simple concept, but it seems as if BMW complicated it by adding useless functions to it. I figured out how to use it within the first 20 minutes and was comfortable by the end of my drive. But that doesn't say that I was extremely frustrated during that time, and I would probably would be in the future. I still much prefer the old knob or button to get things done.

I found the performance to be breathtaking. The car is so quiet and smooth, sometimes you catch yourself going much faster than you thought. Brakes were outstanding, as was the handling. There really is NO body roll! It handled great but was not that much fun to drive, probably because it was so isolated from the road.

Interior was very comfortable, loved the matte finished wood trim. Hated the metallic looking plastic trim, however. Interior was very comfortible.

Overall, I was impressed. Unfortunately, my impressions changed as soon as I drove a 540i. Much faster, more fun to drive, and it had buttons and knobs!!!!"
1509,"July 24, 2002 10:38PM",merc1,"Well I've always said that BMW would have had a true ""segment buster"" if it weren't for the styling. I too at times think it's good looking car, but then I see one with the 18 inch wheels in the wrong color and then yuck(!). I keep seeing them in black with the 19's in chrome, makes a big difference. The car does have ""presence"" but I'm not it's not a good one...all the time. Only black even partially hides that trunklid, which is unforgivable.

But I must say it's the most impressive car I've seen in quite some time, well I guess since 1999 when the S-Class came out. I just love the way BMW and Mercedes leapfrog each other with each re-design of their top sedans.......it sets the stage for all the rest to follow.

1510,"July 25, 2002 3:38PM",bobbyknight,"I entirely agree with what you said. The 18inch wheel on the base car make the 7 look frumpy while the 19inch wheel on the Li make the car look sleek and appealing. I can't believe 1inch could make that much difference. So far, 90 percent of the ones I see on the road have the bigger wheels.

Don't get me wrong, the car is impressive, but it didn't completely blow me away as I had expected it to. It was just boring to drive, more like a Lexus than a BMW. Plus, the i-drive is just too over the top to handle on a daily basis.

So far the A8 looks nice, I just wish Audi would have taken the styling a notch further, especially since it has the conservatively styled Phaeton. As it is now, the car looks too conservative, I would of thought it would look much more Avantissimo-like. This should be the car that sets the design of Audis for years to come, not look like a bigger A4.

The interior seems interesting though. Time will tell if Audi improved on the i-drive like system they have for controlling the functions of the car.

For some reason I think that will be true...at least in the U.S. The new car is handsome, but you're right it is very conservative. The Phaeton looks better, and will probably outsell the A8 in this country. Wouldn't that be something!

But hey things are going to change with the 2004 A6, which ""goes all radical"" according to the European press. They are saying the new A6 will have a huge upright grille along with ""fender haunches"" unlike any other current Audi. Gawd I hope its not ugly!

This is the first official picture of the new Bently GT Coupe...which will probably be called the Continental when it comes out. It shares the same platform as the Phaeton, including the engine, suspension, and transmission. But the Bently has a twin-turbo W12 making 500+ HP, and it's made in Crewe alongside the car.


But weren't Bently owners upset with the original Arnage because it had too many BMW influences? Isn't this new Bently much more VW than the Arnage was BMW? Nice machine though...


I thought the new A8 was on a different platform than the Phaeton...doesn't the A8 have an aluminum spaceframe?

I heard that this is a competitor for the CL600 and will cost around US$160,000. Does anyone know?

Yes the A8 and big V-Dub use the same platform, though in very different guise.

The Bentley coupe is supposed to be around 135K at which point it's going to hurt the current CL600. Mercedes recognizes this, thus the CL600 gets a power boost and other changes for 2003. Bentley is saying they want to sell 3000 of these in the U.S., a truly unobtainable figure.

1542,"August 26, 2002 6:08PM",adu1,"Thanks for the info. And if Mercedes can cover a range from $ 25K to ~ $ 120K, then maybe that's what Lexus will ultimately end up covering, too.

And Lexus may well do a better job of carrying core brand values (generally superb quality, notwithstanding the recent post on loose trim pieces...) from the top of the range to the bottom. (Well, maybe once they replace/upgrade the interior on the IS.)

BTW, $ 70-75K seems like a lot for the LX. Will the replacement model add enough sophistication to justify the jump from the MSRP of the current model? And will there still be a Toyota Land Cruiser in the U.S. market?

Assuming that these are both reasonably accurate quotes, does this tell us something about American vs. British ""baggage"" re luxury cars? Maybe Americans are more likely to assess a vehicle on terms less-weighted by prejudices regarding a marque being up ""upstart,"" etc?

And if *that* holds, then we can perhaps understand ONE reason why new luxury marques would focus on the U.S. for their efforts (on top of the U.S. being one big, rich market)...

Of course, none of this means that there aren't Americans who are willing to pay more for ""heritage"" (or even shell $$$ out for a British ""title"") because of their insecurities. Just, perhaps, not as high a percentage as in other markets."

You and others always point to how insecure people who buy anything but an LS430 are. The way I see it Lexus owners are the insecure ones. Why, because no other group constantly points out why they bought their cars and how everyone else is just plain dumb for buying anything else. If the LS430 was such this car then the S-Class and 7-Series would cease to exists.

And no, I would never call anyone an idiot for a purchasing decision, but I think I have the right to doubt its wisdom. I'm a smart person, but boy have I made some purchasing mistakes in my time.

2. Where did I get the pricing? Edmonds said ""pricing starts at around $53,000 for the E320 and can climb to dizzying heights if you tack on some of the above-mentioned options."" You had an exchange with someone on another board about his $68k E500. A ridiculous price, as even you understood on that board. So I extrapolated that a semi-loaded E 6cyl. would run about 60k. I may be off by a 1,000, but I don't think so.

3. Even if I am off by a k or 2, the point (i.e., the secondary point I was trying to make) is the same. The E is vastly overpriced when compared to it competition. I can't think of an explanation other than DC can get away with it because people fawn over the 3 pointed star.

4. The MAIN point of the message had little to do with the E (which I like, apart from the price) but more to do with Edmund's observation that people buy luxury cars for the ""look-at-me"" factor. I didn't, and I don't know anyone personally who did. While I am sure ljflx is right -- some people do (and that is pathetic) -- but I think most buy these cars b/c they like them and enjoy driving them, not b/c they want heads to turn. When you buy one, let me know the rationale."
1559,"August 30, 2002 5:47AM",nealm1,"And by the way, I just used Edmunds to calculate what a CURRENT E would cost. According to them, with a 48k base price, an E320 nicely (but not fully) optioned would have a MSRP of just a hair under 60k. Since Edmunds says the base MSRP is going up to 53 (a FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR INCREASE??!!!!), I think it is relatively conservative to estimate that a reasonably well appointed 2003 E 320 will be in the 60k+ neighborhood. Gosh, that sounds like a lot of money for that car."
1560,"August 30, 2002 5:58AM",merc1,"Like I said before Lexus folk are always short on facts. You being the perfect example of this. Edmund's first drive was of the E500, not the E320. Fact is the E320 starts around 47K, and one would have to check every option on the list to push the price to 61K.

A E320 DOES NOT COSTS 61K. PERIOD. The E320 starts at $47,615, and the E500 starts at $55,515.

You're telling me to go by facts yet you take a statements like ""an climb to dizzying heights if you tack on some of the above-mentioned options"" as fact, totally ridiculous.

Yes I contend the E, especially the new E500 is sportier than the LS430. The LS430 by design is an isolation chamber.

No matter how politely you word it, whether you're questioning someone's ""wisdom"" or whatever you're still basically saying they're stupid for purchasing anything but an LS430.

"" Even if I am off by a k or 2, the point (i.e., the secondary point I was trying to make) is

I say you're off by more than 2K, try about 10K+ for the E320 (the car you claimed costs 61K). As far as people ""fawning"" over the three pointed star well don't feel slighted because the chromed ""L"" doesn't get as much respect. Lexus fans are always reaching for something. Taking something that Edmunds says and then getting it wrong is the perfect example of this.

Nope, I'm not. But the difference with you guys is that you all constantly put down Mercede-Benz as the main reason you bought a Lexus.

Now you fancy yourself as being so smart yet you can't or won't do the simple research by going to www.mbsua.com and checking the prices listed there in plain ink, but you'll take Edmunds word for it on a test drive when the ACTUAL prices for the new E were not KNOWN to them. Amazing.

How can you claim the E is so expensive when you don't know the FACTS? FACT is the E320 does not start it 53K, it starts at $47,615 (for the last time). Why don't you do some reasearch before tying to tell me I don't know what I'm talking about.

1580,"August 31, 2002 7:03AM",wishnhigh1,"wowsers!

I just went to mbusa.com. Yep a E320 has an MSRP of $47,616. I built my own. I had blue metallic paint with charcoal leather(very nice looking!). I added the sport package, the sunroof/premium sound package, 4 zone climate control, keyless entry, motorola phone, parktronic, and the power sunshades. Basically everything I would want in this car.

Final price: $62,232. Yikes!

I did the same thing with the E500, and the price came out to $66,147.

Now what is wrong with this picture? Why would I go with a V6 E320, when I could go with an E500 with the same exact options, for 4k more. Are they fooling their customers into thinking they are getting a better value, when they are actually paying more for the options?"

Merc1 - You are MB's policeman that is for sure and I think anyone who reads the boards knows it. No disrespect intended on that comment but if you don't see the criticism of Lexus in MB buyers posts, thereby in my mind justifying their purchases, you are kidding yourself. Your sensitivity is towards MB thus you tend to see things in that light. It's natural. But one thing I'll tell you - as a friend - is that when you bring the LS430 and an Avalon together in the same sentence you look bad and its also obvious your emotions, and not your normal logic, are doing the talking.

Nealm1 - went over to the E-class board now that the subject has been focused there somewhat and saw an interesting post. Someone over there wants the MB E-500 to deliver everything the LS430 delivers - great ride, luxury interior, super nav system, luxury seats etc. Now the E-500 has a harsher noisier ride, costs about the same, has noticably less luxury, is smaller and has that awful command system. The poster even mentions that Lexus delivers the desired features. But the person still wants an MB because it has the MB badge. This is exactly what your posts are about.

Lastly - I drove the old E-430 several times and thought it was a bad car - not in general terms but relative to its price. It's interesting now that the new model is out how many auto mags have thrashed the old car but never did so when it was a market car."

Understand that Lexus buyers want a luxurious and pampered environment in their cars with commensurate performance, which is not numb as you describe. I'm all for spirited debate but your constant theme of trashing Lexus as part of your defending MB gets tiresome. Nobody likes to hear the opinion that their daughter is ugly when you know she's not.

Coming up behind either in traffic you can hardly tell them apart. If the S-Class looks like Ford Taurus (per you) then the Avalon and LS430 are twins! Me liking Mercedes-Benz has nothing to with it.

""It's interesting now that the new model is out how many auto mags have thrashed the old car but never did so when it was a market car. ""

That happens with most new car introductions. Why do you and others always try to link such things to MB only? Isn't a new car supposed to improve on the old car's flaws? Wouldn't that make the older car's flaws more apparent?

The difference I see between say you/nealm1 and other Lexus folks is that you try to make it seem like MB's are just junk and that the LS430 is heaven-sent and anyone paying over 55K or so for any other car is making this terminal mistake and that they can't possibly have any sense. I see more MB owners that are understanding of how one could purchase a Lexus than the other way around. Remember V12power, he didn't down Lexus one bit in his logic behind purchasing a Benz.

I said this limo driver in London said the old E was a piece of garbage. I'm sure he meant relative to price as well because the car certainly is not that. That's his opinion anyway and not mine. Given he drove the cars quite often for a living he should know something about them. He told me the cars had reliability problems which is why the service was going to move to Lexus. I said that the old MB E-430 was a bad car relative to a $60k price but it's a wonderful car at say $45k-$48k. Price is relative you know. But you tend to compare a $95k car to a $60k car without even thinking about the price differential. That's unheard of in daily life.

I'll give you my hosest opinions here:

MB's - great cars - badly overpriced and sell at those price points due to image. S-55 and the likes should never come into discussions on ordinary car boards because they are not mainstream cars. Stick to ordinary MB models. A Lexus no cost sport option should not be compared to a very expensive AMG option. When they bring in L-tuned that will be a different story but guaranteed it will be a fraction of AMG's cost. MB quality is dissapointing for cars at those price levels. Look at V-12 power and others. They actually got rid of the cars - stayed with MB but they must have a lot more tolerance for reliability issues than I or many Lexus buyers ever would.

Lexus cars - hate to say this because it's against my constitution - but given their quality and reliability they might actually be underpriced. Great cars. Don't go overboard on handling because it's not needed and rarely used anyway.

automags - they forget buyers of lux cars live in big cities with congested highways. Comparing cars as if we are going to drive on racetracks is crazy."

1593,"August 31, 2002 10:22PM",ljflx,"You've mentioned such things (comparisons that are so widely different in price) many times. I read one recently on the SC board. I've read many such comments in the past or maybe wishinhigh and I just imagined them. BTW a $95k SL should blow away a $61k SC but it doesn't - not by a long shot - and I've now driven both. It's the same story as usual - a bit more handling vs. a plushier ride. MB is making the interior more fashionable - finally - but the SC is still the nicer interior to ""live"" in.

I'll leave you with one last comment and I'm really done with this.

I've read your posts calling the LS430 and other Lexus models boring so many times I need a calculator to keep track of them. When Lexus does bring in the handling and you can't make the boring comment - like on an IS - you say it lacks luxury. I read today in a post of yours that the LS430 rides like an Avalon - I hope you're not serious about that one but given your dislike of Lexus I wouldn't be surprised. Yet unless something changed very recently you've never driven an LS430. So how is it that you are such an expert on it being a boring car - in your opinion of course. Well I thought about that and the only time I came across the boring comment in any article was when a NY Times reporter preferred a Maxima over the LS430 for whatever her ridiculous reasons. Now where did I read the boring posts - yours - countless times and many S-class buyers most of whom didn't even take the LS430 out for a test ride. V-12 power was one of the few who did and I'll respect his opinion but obviously he was looking for a lot more growl and power as his name implies. Another honest poster agonized over the decision of S vs. LS for months and went with the S - which later gave him lots of problems and he had to trade it in - due to style preference. If I remember right he even put a deposit down on an LS430. So for all your boring comments - you've made them with no basis - other than hearsay - most of which came from German car lovers who seem - imo - to need to justify their purchases by thrashing Lexus.

Enough said - I'm tired of this as well but from a totally different viewpoint than you."
1594,"August 31, 2002 10:58PM",merc1,"Well first of all before I say anything about the SL500 and SC430....let me ask do they or do they not compete against each other? Secondly, I'd like to know how the SL500 doesn't blow away the SC430. All the SC430 has going for it is a fancier (tacky to me) interior, stereo and nav system. That in itself is why I label Lexus' cars boring and yawnish, they aren't about driving they're about isolation even more so than Mercedes-Benz. I have never seen so many people harp about a sound system as being one of the main reasons for buying a 60K car!

The SC430 doesn't have anywhere near the technical specification or equipment of the SL. Peirod. The SC430 is outdone at nearly everything.

Sure you're read where I've compared cars with widely ranging price tags, but I thought we were talking about the E-Class and LS430, which is how this latest ""discussion"" got started.

Yep, I'll knock the IS300 till they redesign it. If Mercedes made a car that different from the rest of their lineup, you and others would be all over it for days on end. Yet Lexus makes a small sports sedan with a Toyota Corolla interior and it's some type of god-send. Sure the car is a good handler, but compared to the ES300 it's interior is a joke for a Lexus.

""I read today in a post of yours that the LS430 rides like an Avalon.""

My friend please go back and READ what I said. I said it LOOKS like an Avalon, I said nothing about how it rode. But since you bring it up, are they really that far apart in ride, I mean Toyota's philosphy is pretty much the same across the board. Of course the LS430 would and should ride better, i.e even more isolated. I never agreed with any NY Times reporter about their preference of a Maxima over a LS430, that wasn't me.

Lastly if you havent' seen the word boring when it comes to Lexus' car you aren't reading the right sources. Boring is almost mentioned when talking about the ES300 and LS430.

Like so many times before we're at total opposite ends of this, but you can't tell me you haven't seen where reviewers constantly harp about Lexus' cars being non-involving and boring. Have you seen the latest review of C&D on the ES300? ""Not able to invoke a hint of excitement"" or something to that extent was said.

You're right I haven't driven the LS430, but answer me this has it truly become any more involving from the previous 1995-2000 model? I've driven that model more than a few times and I haven't seen anywhere that the LS430 has become so much sportier relative to the previous model.

I'll ask you this just like I asked wishinhigh, why compare the LS430 to the S-Class since the price difference is so great, what makes the SC430 vs SL500 debate so different from the S430/S500 vs LS430 debate?

But still, there is no way I will pay near $60,000 for a V6 E class even $50,000 is ridiculous as well.

Now who says that Lexus's isolation from the road, lack of handling, cloud-like ride is boring? Just because someone's description of the Lexus is boring to him does not mean that it is boring to a Lexus owner. Who says that harsh ride, rough exhaust note, loud and harsh engine noise is fun behind a sports car? It could be boring to have all those things in a sports car.

Lexus cars are different from Mercedes cars but to say Mercedes or Lexus is better than one another is silly.

Both of them are great cars but to a different degree.

1598,"September 1, 2002 9:37AM",ljflx,"Well said for sure.

Merc1 - the E-class/LS discussion got started on price comparatives of 6cyl E vs. LS430. No technical issues were involved. Nealm1 just tried to state how crazy that was, and except for you, found plenty of agreement. Even you would be hard pressed to say that a 6cyl E could compete with a V-8 of just about any pedigree. Now let's end this and I promise I will never say another negative thing about MB on this board because you simply can't handle it.

Common sense - maybe its me or maybe it's a bragging rights thing. But when I was behind the wheel of the SL the only thing I noticed was a bit tighter road feel and the three pointed star. This was a 15 min drive. All the techno wizardry seems wasted - at least 99% of the time you are behind the wheel. I don't pay $35k extra for things I may need 1% of the time. The SC handled plenty well, rode nicer and had the nicer interior and the better stereo. That and the ability to go from 0-60 with plenty of torque is what I care most about. The excess stuff seems to happen everywhere. I bought a Denon AVR-4802 receiver a while back and compared it against Denon's 5803 and Onkyo's top of the line. The 5803 had it all including 170 watts per channel. The 4802 and the Onkyo had it all also (multiple component HD inputs, 8 optical inputs etc) but the latter two were 125 watts and 130 watts. Now if I put the 125 watt up to a minus 10 setting I will go deaf in my house. If I put it in the plus level it may cause the house to explode. So why bother spending another $1200 dollars on all that extra wattage. Sorry for the sidebar but this discussion just reminded me of my receiver research."

1601,"September 1, 2002 4:13PM",ljflx,Depends on your family needs and what you've gotten used to. The E is only 189 inches long and I found it too confining in the front and back for myself and my family. It's not all that wide. My wife thought it was far too small in the back particularly with a car seat. The LS430 should be 2-3 inches lomger and the S 2-3 inches shorter imo. The S-class is deceiving as it hides its bulk real well. You tend also to forget how long it is until you drive it.

If the SC and SL aren't competitors then the S430/S500 and LS430 aren't either right? Don't they have a 20K base price difference too?""

Okay, you asked for an explanation, and I can give it to you, just be patient.

When someone decides to buy a new car, they usually set a goal price...usually the top price they will pay, out the door. This is even before they start looking at and comparing different models. They might have a few models in mind, but the real comparison starts after the goal price is set.

I think we could all agree that price is the most common limiting factor(do not confuse with determining factor) in a new car purchase, right?

So in the sense of the market, the LS430 is more of a competitor with the E430. There is the basic answer to your question. Same goes with the SC versus the SL...in terms of the market, the SC430 is more of a competitor with the CLK.
------------------------------
However, the issue you push is comparison. There is a difference between cars that are comparable and cars that are competitors.

The LS is comparable to the S class. The GS is comparable to the E class.

For me personally, the SC and the SL dont even compare. Sure, the arangement is pretty similar, but the purpose is completely different. The SL was designed with performance and luxury. The SC has never intended any emphasis on performance, other than having a fairly powerful engine.

The same goes with the ES and the C class. They are competitors, however they do not compare in my mind. FWD never has competed with RWD in my mind though. But that doesnt stop them from competing.
----------------------
Competing encompasses price as a major priority, because that is how cars compete in peoples minds. Comparing does not encompass price. You could compare a Pontiac Bonneville with a BMW 745, if your only consideration was size...however that does not mean they are competitors."

It just doesn't over-deliver it and to compare it to a Buick is absurd because the latter has no performance at all. Plus it delivers it without compromising an incredibby wonderful ride. I'll take excess luxury with the right amount of performance over excess performance and less luxury all the time.

Wishinhigh - you said it about as well as it can be said. That is why when I was last shopping i initially started out comparing an E to an LS430, That was a mismatch supreme. So i went to the S-430 which was in the same league but priced 9k or so higher. Now we had a match going but the S-430 was an underpowered car next to the LS430 so I quickly moved onto the S-500. A great match but the latter was $18k more and could be optioned out to be $25-35k more. I thought the LS430 a better car than an S-500 for my driving desires and its ride quality and it was the more luxurious car. The sport version - if I wanted more performance - handles better than any base S-430/500 and it costs $100 more than a base LS430 - for the tires. But there was a wait for the car at the time and I couldn't wait."

If you think about it the philosphy is the same, Lexus just elevates it compared to a Buick.

I got an LS430 after two MB, and it would take a major upheaval in one of the two brands to make me think of switching back. Most of the people I have seen posting in the LS board had previously owned MB as well, and also considered an S class purchase. None come to mind that regretted their decision to go with Lexus.
How many former LS owners have switched to MB and been happy afterwards? To me this is a true test of how the customer base for both these cars perceives their relative merit, more than comparisons based on magazine statistics from people that have never had more than a test drive in either.

1643,"October 8, 2002 2:42PM",linard,"cul8ter - I agree with you that the failure of any component on a car such as a Mercedes is unthinkable, it is not the sign of weakness or deterioration on Mercedes' part. While many of believe Mercedes to be subpar on reliability scores, I still believe they still are the tops in durability. I have enough friends and acquantances that service the luxury marks to generalize the longevity of Lexus, Mercedes, and BMW. These mechanics believe that an E class will outlive any GS or LS Lexus and even the 5 series BMW. Go to Europe, you'll see Mercedes being the main brand utilized by taxi drivers and services. This is due to the fact that those E classes will go 200 to 300 miles w/o major failures (such as those of major driveline components or structural deterioration). These taxis are then resold to private owners who cannot afford a newer luxury make. While Lexus is tops in reliability, it's long-term durability is not as trusted as Mercedes. For example, I have seen a lot more tired 90-93 LS' than same period S Classes. In addition, the plastics of the Lexus, which I can vouch for as my extended father figure has had two, do not hold up as well as those of a Mercedes (of which, we've had three). They are much softer I agree, but they are not as durable. The leather fits along the same lines, much softer in a Lexus, but find any 4 year or older Lexus with average miles, and you'll see much more wear and tear than in a Benz.

While many of you have also discussed the group that has switched from Mercedes and to a lesser degree BMW to Lexus, I know many who have switched from Lexus to Mercedes b/c there is a perceived difference in qualities such as solidity and perceived safety. A friend of mine who has a 2001 LS430 didn't realize how unsatisfied he would be with his car is now trying to sell it. He also has a 92 SL that he's trying to sell as well since he can't fit in it anymore. But he will agree that there is this sense of solidity that you can't quantify in a Benz.

Reliability is difficult to gauge as the typical Mercedes driver will more angry at any mechanical or electrical issue than that of a Lexus driver. I myself know of hoards of Mercedes drivers who have had no issue on their late model Mercedes. Mercedes, while rated less in reliablity than Lexus, is similar or better than BMW and Audi.

In the end, I do believe Mercedes must continue improving it's perceived and actual quality which I think will be marked by the year 2003 as the new E and CLK class have been rated ahead of their competitors in European publications. They both have been heralded as a return to traditional Mercedes values of quality. The S class receives a much needed interior revamp, the SL is just wonderful, and the M class has one less year of life."
1644,"October 8, 2002 3:13PM",sweetjeldorado,"You are lucky that you are one of the few that has a very reliable 190E.

However, I don't feel they are true luxury since they break down all the time. And to make matters worse, I see more '86-'92 E class than '84-'93 190 Es. How is that?

Simply put, the 190 is pure garbage and if you look at most of them that are around today, they look like crap as well. And I am surprised that they have not aged well like the 300E compared next to them. Those 190s creak and rattles over minor potholes and bumps now. Poor condition automobiles at best.

My car is basically just like a smaller version of a 300E, I don't see how they are garbage at all.

I have stated a many times that Mercedes-Benz needs to get reliability under control especially since they're taking technology further and further with each re-design. Agreed.

What gets me about certain people in here is that they'll tell you that a Benz is made of Kia grade plastic and a sound system so bad that you can't hear it. Every Mercedes is this cheaply built, poor handling, terribly unreliable side-of-the-road car.

Lexus on the other hand has never ever had a problem, no recalls nothing. Perfect in just about every way. Good-looking, welded correctly from the factory, outhandles BMWs etc, etc.

Pluskin, handling like a BMW was never part of the design brief for any Mercedes except the C-Class. Where is it written that a Mercedes has to out-handle a BMW? BMW for all their ""handling"" doesn't move nearly as many cars as Mercedes does over 50K. Handling plays second fiddle to cracked engine blocks and failed SMG transmissions. Don't get me wrong, I love BMWs, but this ""handling"" thing is getting a little absurd now. Nowhere other than at the C-Class level has Mercedes ever said anything about BMW and trying match their handling.
As far as safety is concerned I think you need to see the photo about 10 or posts back. I seriously doubt any other car would have held up as good as that S430 did. Only Volvo comes to mind.

""World class car engineering should include the engineering that goes into making all customers happy...not just the engineering that goes to making engineers and car enthusiasts happy.

Nearly impossible. You can't make everyone happy. A Mercedes never was and never will be as ""plush"" as certain cars it's not the MB way. If you want gushy-plush, Cadillac and Lexus will gladly sell you a car. If Mercedes went that route their traditional customers would be gone.

Do they out-handle BMWs? No, never were intened to. Better reliability than Lexus. No. No argument there.

You own top of the line MB and Lexus - so how do they rate in terms of satisfaction, dealer service etc. I was nip and tuck with the S-500 but went LS430 because I felt it was the better car for me and fully expected the perfect reliability I've had with Lexus for 8 years now. In fairness to the S though it was based on a few test drives but I had way too mamy doubts about MB reliability and dealer service as well.

I also have the LX470 and find it a great SUV. Incredible ride for such a big vehicle. How does the H1 rate against it or vice versa?"
1652,"October 8, 2002 11:06PM",cul8ter,"Before I go into my thoughts on each of my cars, I'd like to comment on how this message board is a perfect example of how statistics are only as objective as the opinions that back them. I recognize that 100 S500's lined up side-by-side will not have the same reliability or quality problems that I have had with mine. I also recognize that if 100 S430's were driven through a wall and off a building, neither the driver nor the car would survive in every instance.

All of my cars are pretty good cars. I have a high level of satisfaction with all of them but for different reasons.

The H1 is worthless as far as every day transportation goes, but I didn't buy it to be comfortable getting from point A to point B. It has a very strong presence and gets more attention than you could ever imagine. When I want attention, that's what I drive. I used a Bentley for this purpose in the past, but Bentley's don't get as much attention as the use to.

If more than 5 people need to go with me somewhere and it doesn't make since to take a limo to the destination, I take the LX470. I don't care much for the way it looks from the outside, but everything else is excellent. When I need space and comfort, I drive the LX.

The S80 was purchased strictly because it is very safe and I insisted that my child have one of the safest cars available. It blends in well with other cars and doesn't draw too much attention to my child.

In all the ways that matter to me, the LS430 and the S500 are exactly the same. If I'm going to a place where S500's are more prominent, I drive the LS430. If I'm going to a place where LS430's are more prominent, I drive the S500. The differences in the cars make excellent topics for conversations. I like these two because both are very comfortable when I have to drive somewhere that's more than 30 minutes away. My dealership experiences are probably different from most peoples because I am treated very, very well at all of the dealerships that I actually visit. Most of the time I have someone else take the car in for me though. So, from my perspective there's very little difference. I do notice that other customers who are at the Mercedes dealership while I'm there are not treated nearly as well as I'm treated, but the other customers at the Lexus dealership are treated about the same as I am.

Ultimately, when you have every car you want at the same time, the differences between them aren't as significant as they seem when you don't have them all. If I had to make a choice between cars, I think the differences would be magnified."

No what I'm saying is that the differences you and others harp upon aren't that great nor do they make enough difference for hundreds of thousands of car buyers all over the world that STILL buy all these poorly made, poorly sounding and poorly navigating Mercedes-Benzes. That shows that leather, plastics, stereos, and nav system do NOT a Benz make.

I've said this before and I'll say it again. Every luxury brand in the U.S should sell more cars than Mercedes-Benz Why? Mercedes' average car is around 50K, there is no way they should be selling as many cars as they do in the U.S., the fact that they do is a accomplishment in itself. Furthermore the sales gap between Lexus and Merceds isn't all that big anyway, BMW, Lexus and then Mercedes....they're all in the top 3.

Lexus is smart. They let people like Mercedes work the bugs out of new technology, and then implement it when they can deliver it free of flaws and reliability problems.

Exactly, thats why they'll forever be a follower. Lexus can't do squat with their flagship sedan until they find out what Mercedes is doing next. They're so smart they copied the previous S-Class' design. Brilliant. Question: What technology did Mercedes introduce that Lexus later perfected? Just dying to hear the answer to that one.

Nope.

No they shouldn't. You can't please everyone, period. Nor should they try. Some of those things you listed aren't even worth chasing down. Mercedes was never a handlin' sort of car like a BMW so again, why would they now change this? Again, for a few who'll never buy a Benz. I know you understand this.

On a different note, the G500 is a ex-military vehicle, it definitely won't appeal to everyone.

AFter looking at the pics a bit longer yesterday, I also think they could have gone further with the styling, so to say. At the same time, I think the 2004 XJ is distinguishable from the current XJ in most respects. The key respect is aerodynamics, the current Jag looks old and a lot of age shows in the flat A to C-pillar arc(or lack of arc) and well as the outdated clunky chrome surrounding the side windows.

Here's where I think they could have gone further, the rear end. It looks too similar to the current one. They should have done something more original with the lights.

They really couldn't afford to radically alter the last ""true"" Jaguar, at least in some peoples (Jaguarlites) eyes.

Ford isn't going to give Jaguar the funds to out-tech the S-Class, 7-Series or A8 so they've chosen to stick with classic style, while at least making the car competive on the technical front. The new XJ's interior is gorgeous, as is the exterior. However the new car is much more functional than before, and more importantly much roomier. For a good look at the new XJ take a look at the November issue of CAR magazine.

1684,"October 20, 2002 8:03AM",glamourlife,"Lexus is not even in the same league at the high end of the spectrum. Talk about cheap plastics, Toyota switchgear, and gaudy fake looking wood, the Lexus has it all.

Why are people asserting that the LS430 has some marvelous interior??! I wonder if they have honestly spent significant time in one and then compared it with a 7, S, or A8? The quality gap is extreme. The LS seems all show, with no substance. Their wood seems like its Faux, and the leather, plastics, and controls are cheap shiny Toyota grade.

Lexus represents a bargain, but once you get over $50K They can't compete. They are very reliable, but that does not necessarily mean durable. There is a HUGE difference between the two. The reliability edge is also diminishing. Jaguar, Cadillac, MB, BMW, and even Buick have all either closed the gap, or are in the process of doing so with new releases. For value driven buyers, Lexus is a good buy, although Acura, Cadillac, Volvo, and Infiniti are better in many areas.

As for premium automobiles, they are always a step behind in styling, technology, performance, and safety. They don't even offer automobiles on the level of the A8, 745Li, 760Li, S500, S55, CL500, CL55, SL500, SL55, E500, Z8, M5, S8, etc."
1685,"October 20, 2002 10:49AM",ljflx,"Lexus is in the discussion because you are dead wrong in your assertions. It has the best body build of all these cars and far and away the best reliability. Fake looking wood - really??? Enough said.

Merc1 - does this count as a putdown or not?"
1686,"October 20, 2002 10:51AM",linard,"Yes, only the 7 series Li models have the chrome strip for the gutter rails in the roof. I think they make the car visually longer and much more attractive."
1687,"October 20, 2002 11:11AM",carnaught,".....conclusions are subjective. Most of the rest of the automotive world doesn't agree with you. On the contrary, your criticisms of interior materials and designs have applied more to Mercedes. For example, look at the blank space below the radio in the dash of the new CLK500, and tell me that doesn't look base Nissan or Toyota. I suppose you think Audi interiors look cheap also."
1688,"October 20, 2002 12:45PM",glamourlife,"CarNaught, what automotive world are you referring to? Every review I have read has had strong praise for BMW's, Audi's, and MB's in relation to Lexus. I've read reviews where the old CLK was deemed superior to the (at that time) brand new SC430. The S500 and 7 series always place 1, 2. The E Class is the standard bearer for midsize luxury sedans, and the 5 series is the world's best sports sedan. BMW dominates most comparison tests, especially when the tests are skewed more towards performance. Benz always finishes strong, but is knocked a couple of notches down due to price. Lexus scores strong for reliability, value, and dealer relations, but it is always dinged for questionable derivative styling, lack of a ""soul"", and luxo-barge performance.

Audi definitely does not look cheap. Their interiors are very stylish and high grade. The new CLK500 has an interior of premium quality as well. Nothing in it looks even remotely like a Nissan or Toyota. MB's have always skewed more stark and functional than plush. Nevertheless, the new CLK and E raise the bar considerably for MB. These two are their middle of the road ""bread & butter affordable"" models and MB definitely made vast improvements with both over their predecessors(Save for styling/looks of the CLK).

And Ljflx Lexus is no where near the best body build. They are undoubtedly reliable, but again, durability and reliabilty are not the same. BMW's, Audi's, Porsche, MB's, Volvos, etc. have a more solid build quality that instills vault like construction. The Lexus in comparison feels thin and tinny. And yes, the wood looks fake and gaudy. Look at the rose tinted wood in the LX470 and compare it to wood found in the G500 or X5. The LX's wood is more along the lines of the Escalade's Faux Zebrano.

BMW and MB have aggressive new products planned that will continue to raise the bar even further. Lexus continues to look to both companies for direction. Name one innovation or technology Lexus has implemented? The German companies have their faults, but at least they take risks. Cadillac will even soon surpass Lexus as they continue to evolve and introduce new models. Lexus is ""Old School"". They are more out of touch with the younger generation than Mercedes, Cadillac, or any other luxury player. They need a radical injection of unique product, and unfortunately that is not even in the works for them."

    I always find it interesting when I read posts from such obviously biased and fanatical ""car nuts"". It's great being passionate about something, but your opinions can't be taken seriously when they are so blatantly biased and, in some cases, just wrong.

     In my humble opinion, the Lexus LS430 is the most luxurious car in the ultra-luxury class, especially with its interior and smooth ride quality. The BMW 7 is the most athletic, and the MB S-Class is a great compromise between the two. I think Lexus is fantastic, but I'm not blinded to a specific brand or country like some. I'll be picking up my 2003 330ci in December, because I think it's a class above the IS300, A4, and C-Class. My feeling was that the LS430 was a class above the 7 and S, and that's why my parents drive one.

1690,"October 20, 2002 3:11PM",carnaught,.....Amen.
1691,"October 20, 2002 3:30PM",ljflx,"I guess you see what you want to see. In the Ultra LS430 some of the wood has an exotic ""granite"" like look. In the non-ultra models the wood is as realistic and beautiful as fine furniture. I've got Baker and Henredon furniture all over my house so I know a thing or two about wood.

The body build on the LS430 is fabulous. All these cars have great body builds.

There's no problem being biased towards a brand or German brands but get realistic."
1692,"October 20, 2002 5:11PM",footie,"On initial quality, year in and year out, Lexus, particularly the LS430 is the winner. It's initial defect level for the last 4 years was about 1/6th of what the MB are. In everyone of those years the entire Lexus line has swept the JDPower Initial quality awards.

On Reliability, there is also no comparison. Consumer Reports ranks Lexus as Exceptional Reliability for the ES, GS, LS and RX.

If you go to Consumer Reports, who has the largest, best instrumented test facility in North America for new and used cars and best tracking system for in-service problems, the Mercedes product line is only of Average Reliability, and that in good years. There is a lot of variance in the MB reliability too.

In recent years the E was rated 1997 98 - Below Average, 99 - 00 Average, 01 - Below Average.

Fortunately for the E fans, it has a the best, most recent reliability and quality of the entire MB line. The 2000 - S (1st year of the marquee model ) was rated poor. The M class trucks, like the BMW X5, are rated poor and on the 'dont buy list'.

There is much to like about a Benz. Like a BMW, Audi or Lexus in their respective classes, each has it's own cache and appeal. You may prefer the look and feel and layout of the dash, the seats, the tint of the moonroof, whatever. Some like the way individual cars feel, accelerate or handle.

But Mercedes doesn't lead in quality or reliability and hasn't for some time. It's not likely that they ever will again, either."
1693,"October 20, 2002 7:28PM",glamourlife,"I never said MB leads in reliability! I agree that the Lexus has been a reliability star for years. But again, reliability and durability are not the same thing. I am not blinded to German cars only. I have owned several makes and models, and through my close friends I have experience with just about every luxury car out there.

I like Lexus cars for the value they represent. I have repeatedly said that they offer tremendous value and reliability. 3 years ago when I was looking for a new family vehicle, I got the LX470. It was and is a great truck, but it is far from perfect.

The first week I had it it began to rattle from within the gear selector. Several visits to the dealer did not cure the sound either. It has been completely reliable and has never left me stranded, but I have learned to live with the vibrations. It is also underpowered.

And pcbrs, one article found from the web does not convince me of anything. I can find hundreds of articles on the new BMW's, MB's, to refute that article. Just look at the reviews on Edmunds."

While your at it, try this one...

http://thecarconnection.com/index.asp?article=5213&n=157,183&sid=183

In regards to interior it says ""...The displays are quite classy, though surprisingly simple in design, especially compared to the flashy lights and graphics Japanese luxury marques have adapted. But functionally, the E-Class instrumentation is a lot easier to read."" The Japanese brands do get remarks about their interior finsih still being tighter than MB, but the article concludes with ""...With the new E-Class, Mercedes has pulled out all the stops. It is difficult to understate just how much of an improvement has been made in an already strong product. The 2003 E-Class clearly shows that Mercedes can build a driver&#146;s car. In performance and handling terms, it&#146;s still not quite a BMW, but the E-Class has plenty of other advantages that will help it maintain its edge in a tightly competitive luxury segment.""


Check out this one on the new CLK...

http://thecarconnection.com/index.asp?article=5186&n=157,183&sid=183


One of the notable quotes on interior design states, ""Inside, it&#146;s luxury all the way. Leather in generous helpings adorn the seats, the door interiors, and just about everything else you look at. Handsome without glitz or gloss, the soft surfaces are waiting to be touched. In fact the entire interior-designer decor proclaims: &#147;This is as good as it gets.&#148; ""


Here is a quote on the Lexus ES300, ""...One other thing&#151;fully kitted out as our tester was, the ES 300 becomes dang close to a $40,000 proposition&#151;nearly BMW 5-Series territory (the base price is $31,505). At that price, in this segment, you need something more enthusiast-oriented than a dressed-up Camry. The ES 300, Lexus&#146; biggest seller, has always been outsold by the sportier Acura 3.2 TL by nearly a 2-1 margin. And if I were a Lexus marketer, I&#146;d be losing sleep over the Infiniti G35.""


And another on the flagship LS430 from Edmunds, ""So nearly perfect is this vehicle that the few nits I have to pick seem silly, save one. For example, the plastic parking brake release exhibits too much gloss. The front passenger airbag isn't seamlessly integrated into the dash or hidden behind the lovely rosewood decorating the panel above the dual-tiered glovebox. Some climate and stereo functions are bundled with the navigation screen, ridiculous given the amount of space gone underutilized on the center stack. And the remote keyless entry fob for this premium car provides poorly marked buttons that are difficult to see in dim light.


The big surprise, however, was how much creaking, rattling and buzzing the cabin of our test vehicle exhibited. Idling at a light, I detected a barely discernable buzz from the rear headliner area. On a rough side street near our office, the interior emitted damped and low-frequency, but still evident, rattles and squeaks. A couple of sharper bumps resulted in creaking from the dash. Considering how well Lexus nailed the rest of the car, this apparent build-quality problem was truly surprising.


Derivative best describes the styling, which to my eye incorporates a combination of past and present Mercedes-Benz cues. The overall effect is pleasing, if unremarkable. I prefer the more forceful appearance of a BMW 7 Series, sleek look of a Mercedes-Benz S-Class, classic image of a Jaguar XJ8 or refined visage of an Audi A8. ...

    The examples you offer seem tenous to me, and require a biased interpretation of the reviews of MB products you offered. They are stating the interiors are luxurious and in some cases outstanding. However, you seem to be trying to use those praises to support your idea that ""The LS seems all show, with no substance. Their wood seems like its Faux, and the leather, plastics, and controls are cheap shiny Toyota grade."" Kind of sad.

I don't understand why you think the MB interior is so superb, considering its use of COMAND, ""optional"" single CD in dash, etc. Anyway, since you seem to respect EDMUNDS reviews, here's a link you should check out:


http://www.edmunds.com/reviews/roadtests/roadtest/46353/article.html


The article states:


""We had to settle for the regular old Mark Levinson/navigation package. The single-disc DVD-based navigation system is notable for its excellence in ease of operation, thanks to its touchscreen and expedited processing. An interesting feature is the voice activation system.""


""Ah yes, the Mark Levinson stereo system. We practically had to wipe the slobber off the dash, so enthused was our stereo evaluator. He claimed that it's the best OEM sound he's ever had the pleasure to listen to, bar none.""


""Other gadgetphile lures that you don't have to pay extra for include side mirrors that not only provide puddle lamps, but also can be set to fold in automatically when you park your Lexus. The mirrors themselves tilt down when you're backing up. The center air vent can be set to automatically undulate, and we felt as if we were in a tropical locale being fanned with a giant palm frond when trying this feature out. You get xenon headlamps as standard equipment, and the wipers are rain-sensing, not merely speed-sensitive, as on the 2002 Q45.""


""The LS will provide the same refinement levels as the German uber-sedans, only without the holier-than-thou attitude. And if your ingrained Puritan is nibbling upon your conscience for your flagrant disregard of your upbringing, quell it by telling it that you're driving an ultra-low emissions vehicle.""


-Jeff


""Lexus was most thoughtful about storage space in the LS 430. There's a dual glovebox, each of which are sizeable. Expanding door bins allow for easy access to your things. The center console is dual-tiered, but you'll still have access to the upper tier when you open the second deeper bin. There's a sunglasses holder overhead, and a convenient 5-minute voice recorder. A double sunshade prevents the sun from unduly causing a glare.""


""The incredibly comfortable driver seat offers 14-way power adjustment with lumbar control and a power height-adjustor seatbelt, which is easy to insert into its slot thanks to the illuminated buckles. Beautiful Optitron gauges provide great gauge cluster visibility, and the premium-quality California walnut wood trim and delectable leather will mollify even the most discerning of tastes. The tilt/telescoping steering wheel and the seat move out of the way for easy ingress/egress."""

1700,"October 21, 2002 12:37PM",ejerod,"Ladies and Gentlemen. I own 2 of MB's finest. The 2002 S500 with AMG Sport Package, and the 2003 SL500 hardtop convertible. I also own the 2002 Lexus GS300 which I think is the best car that Lexus makes overall. All of the things you guys are arguing about are subjective. I personally didn't buy the LS430 because I think it looks too bland. IMO Lexus did the same thing that Infinity did with the Q45 before it's recent renovation. They were afraid of alienating their client base and went for safe and bland instead of being creative and going for beauty and excitement. The numbers tell the story well. The Q45 lost a huge market segment, ( and Lexus isn't meeting their sales expectations with the LS430 either. The other cars, the RX, GS, ES and SC's are selling gangbusters) . Mercedes on the other hand has been bold and a leader in not only technological innovation, ie Brake by wire technology, keyless go, radar controlled cruise control , 16 seconds to go from a hard top touring sedan to a convertible, etc. MB has led the way in styling. The S Class, E Class, SL class and others are the most stunning looking cars on the road. Are they perfect ? None of them are. I for one don't like that MB still uses cd rom technology for the nav system. At the same time I hate the looks of the LS430. It's bland and doesn't generate excitement when I look at it. The wheels on the base model LS430 look like something you'd see on a Ford Escort. The GS on the other hand looks like it performs. Exciting, quick,etc. I have the new GS 300 with the Sport Package and the shifting paddles built into the wheels. I'm still young. I'm 39 and people still card me when I go out because I look like a teen. Everywhere I go when I use the valet my cars are displayed at the front door, while the LS430's are relegated to the other end of the lot... All these cars have their pros and cons.. one has to decide what turns him/her on, and buy what he/she likes.. the opinions of others don't really matter... Happy motoring.."
1701,"October 21, 2002 1:45PM",glamourlife,Great Post Ejerod. Spoken like a person with real experience with luxury makes.
1702,"October 21, 2002 1:56PM",ljflx,Lexus blew away the sales targets in 2001 (32% over) and exceeded them again in 2002 and is off to a good start in 03.
1703,"October 21, 2002 3:48PM",1487,"I dont think the GS is selling like gangbusters. I dont think it has had a good year since it's first two on the market. I feel its styling has held it back from teh type of success lexus expected. In addition, the cost of the car kept creeping towards its superior German competition at it doesnt look so good at those prices.

The LS430 is very bland in spite of its nicely executed interior. That car has some of the worst rims on any luxury car. I dont think I have ever seen a person under 65 driving an LS430. I dont think there's anything wrong with older buyers but I find it interesting that Lexus is never criticized for designing cars that appeal to retirees while cadillac and lincoln are constantly ridiculed for that."

also saw a millenium silver LS430 this morning; shocked by the rims (they were the 16-inch). One negative thing i have about the car is that it reminded me about the enormously large previous-generation S_class. In my opinion, I don't think that the front and rear of the LS430 match that well, as opposed to the S-class or Jaguar."

Secondly, I do not work for you, and it is not my job to produce things for you on demand. Finally, As I have stated repeatedly, Lexus is not forcing MB to do anything. MB is the leader, risk taker, and trendsetter. Lexus cannot make a move without seeing what MB or BMW will or already have done.

Now instead of throwing words like Silly, fanatic, etc. around, let's use real world experience. The few owners of Lexus and MB vehicles who have chimed in have backed up most if not all of my opinions. again, I own a Lexus as my daily driver. It is reliable and luxurious, however I would liken it's luxury more to Cadillac and Lincoln than to BMW or Mercedes. Do any of you who worship at the altar of Lexus have real world experience with any of their models?"
1707,"October 21, 2002 10:58PM",pcbrs,"Glamourlife-

I was taken aback by your rather sharp response. I don't think carnaught was trying to be rude by his comment, and I wholeheartedly agree with his assessment. You really need to step back from this forum, and realize we mean no offense. We're just here to discuss and exchange our ideas and opinions. So take a deep breath, and let's continue our friendly dialogue.

I for one have real world experiences with many brands. My parents bought the LS430 upon my recommendation, because an evaluation of the BMW 7 and new S class revealed them to be not as luxurious... in MY opinion. The Lexus ride is soft, luxurious, and quiet... just like the way my mom likes it. The interior was by far of the highest quality. I've spent my share of time in a S, and the cheap, gimmicky plastic got to me. The 7 series was over complicated, and looked like it would be frought with technical issues... which was confirmed. The A8's interior, however, was a different story. My mom has driven Acuras and BMWs in the past, and this is by far her favorite. Some of my friends are also quite financially well off, so I've had the fortune of sampling many different MB, BMW, and Audi products, including the SL55, SLK320, 745li, etc.

I'm getting a BMW 330ci in December, because it's the right car for me. The interior isn't as luxurious or is of a caliber of a Lexus. It's known for its interior rattling, especially with the Sport Package and Harmon Kardon upgrade, both of which I have opted for. The HK upgrade really pales to the Mark Levinson system. But, I can live a less luxurious interior, given it's more athletic performance. I guess we all have our own assessments. But mine seem to follow most magazines, the sources you value so much.

ejerod-
I respectfully disagree with some of the things you said. I found the GS300 to be underpowered for my taste, but I guess you can drive the SL for more spirited driving. The LS has been exceeding sales expectations, and has been consistently outselling the S, since its introduction. Good night.

1708,"October 22, 2002 8:14AM",ljflx,"I have Lexus vehicles including the LX470 which is one hell of an suv - imo - which is why I took it. Do you think it is not a great truck and if not why? You have your choice of suspension settings and the luxury is top notch. Cadillac is not in this league right now but they are rising.

MB - You honestly think they didn't respond to Lexus? They'd be in sad shape today if they didn't. The business market of the 90's expanded the luxury market and MB would have cleaned up if Lexus wasn't around. Being a car fan is one thing but understanding the underlying fundamentals of a business and competition is another. When you see an LS430 on the road there is a very good bet that if Lexus wasn't around that would have been an S-430/500 sale or an E-500 sale. The GS sales would have been a lot of E-320 sales. Did Lexus hurt MB? For sure. Did MB respond to the competition well? Absolutely. But the move to younger buyers of cars at this price point is not a safe bet given the economy is so different than it was in the last 7-8 years.

Age factor - I see many a young driver behind the wheel of LS400/430's. It's Cadillac and Lincoln that still have the older demographics."

ljflx: I'm 36 and behind the wheel of an LS (being such a youngster probably explains why I opted for the sport suspension)"
1710,"October 22, 2002 2:27PM",glamourlife,"Ljflx- Sure some people cross shop MB and Lexus, but they are really Apples and Oranges. Lexus products are much softer and geared towards luxury and comfort first. Lexus offers superior value so people motivated by price or who can't afford the added expense usually opt for Lexus. Lincoln, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac have suffered the most from the emergence of Lexus, not Mercedes and BMW.

BMW and MB both are enjoying record sales years, and have done so for several consecutive years. Moreover every ""comparable"" MB model is at least $10K-$15K more than Lexus, yet MB still manages to sell more than its fair share. Lexus may look to MB and BMW for direction as they always have, but they have stolen sales from Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, and Lincoln mostly. Lexus is probably one of the most important reasons Oldsmobile lost so much market share and shut down.

Competition is good for any industry, however you cannot foolishly assert that every LS430 driving down the road is one less S-Class. That is ridiculous. The LS starts at $55K, you can't even think about an S-Class for less than $75K. A $20K spread is reason enough for many buyers to look at Lexus. But how would you explain record sales and profits for MB if Lexus is supposedly stealing so much share? The S-Class is in direct competition with the A8 and 7-series mostly. Sure the Q45, Deville, RL, etc. can all claim to be in the competitive set, but they are really LS430 competitors. Lexus by and large is an old person's car. It is just a modern interpretation of what Buick, Lincoln, and Cadillac used to do so well before Lexus emerged. Create plush, comfortable, and luxurious cars. However, the lack of innovation inherent since the company's founding causes it to be lacking in ""Soul"" and leadership.

Again, I ask anyone to name one Lexus automobile innovation? When MB can point to ABS, Crumple zones, Stability control, distronic cruise control, sensotronic brakes, and a host of other innovations, that fully illustrates it is playing in a different league altogether than Lexus."
1711,"October 22, 2002 2:44PM",pcbrs,"Glamourlife-

I'm sorry. I can't help but chuckle a little at your latest comment. You're right. Not everyone shopping for an LS430 would've bought an MB S-Class. My parents certainly could've purchased one, but chose not to, but this isn't always the case. For the price of a nicely loaded LS430, one could also purchase an E500. Price isn't always the motivation, as I know several people who cross shop between all those luxury brands you mentioned.

Now that several people have successfully refuted your questionable assertion that Lexus interiors are not up to par, you seem to be trying to distract the issue with subjective statements like lack of ""Soul"". So how are we supposed to argue which car has more prestige or soul? Sounds like a very shallow, and rather pretentious subject to me, that can never really be objectively argued anyway. Just to humor you, I would argue that Lexus has shown remarkable leadership in improving the quality of dealership service. MB and BMW still have a lot to learn, and catch up on. The Optitron gauges on the LS430 are also the best designed gauge clusters in the market period... IMHO. This is going back to your original comment about LS430 interior quality.

We all have argued this ""innovation"" thing before, and it's best said that Lexus isn't an innovator. At least when it comes to technology, design, styling or any of the things German cars do so well.

Yes they raised the bar on quality, and the whole business of selling and servicing cars. I can *see* where some would see this as an ""innovation"". However, when it comes to the cars themselves they'll never win over the enthusiast like MB, BMW or Audi do. Never. All the reliability, mints, carwashes, soft leather, ML stereos, and DVD based Nav systems in the won't change this. The fact that so many Lexus fans points to Nav systems and leather quality is very telling about whats important to them, nothing wrong with those things, but they're obviously not enough to sway the many that still buy German cars.

You make some interesting points. You're right. I would argue they are all important. And they are all areas of innovation. Some areas are more important than others for different people. I'm giving up luxury and superior quality build with the BMW (over Lexus), but it's more fun more me to drive. My priorities may change when I'm much older though. Who knows?

1714,"October 22, 2002 3:35PM",ljflx,"I know 7 people who drive Lexus automobiles and SUV's. They are all most likely MB buyers if not for Lexus. They are not even remotely thinking of the domestic brands and most importantly they all come out of MB,BMW or Audi in the first place, and in some cases for many years. They all make 6 figures and in a few cases 7 figures. These are not people buying Buicks - even for their kids who are reaching driving ages. The average income for LS430, LX470 and SC430 buyers is above $250,000 per year - same as MB S-class buyers.

Lexus's whole marketing posture is aimed at the high-end German brands most notably MB. When was the last time you saw Lexus market against the domestic brands?"

1718,"October 22, 2002 4:10PM",glamourlife,"provided? I put up an article from Edmunds that questioned the build quality of the LS. Again, reliability and shiny interiors do not equal durability and build quality. Yes Lexus may have more plush and comfortable interiors, but their build quality is not superior to BMW or MB. Please re-read the following article I put up already:

....And another on the flagship LS430 from Edmunds, ""So nearly perfect is this vehicle that the few nits I have to pick seem silly, save one. For example, the plastic parking brake release exhibits too much gloss. The front passenger airbag isn't seamlessly integrated into the dash or hidden behind the lovely rosewood decorating the panel above the dual-tiered glovebox. Some climate and stereo functions are bundled with the navigation screen, ridiculous given the amount of space gone underutilized on the center stack. And the remote keyless entry fob for this premium car provides poorly marked buttons that are difficult to see in dim light.

The big surprise, however, was how much creaking, rattling and buzzing the cabin of our test vehicle exhibited. Idling at a light, I detected a barely discernable buzz from the rear headliner area. On a rough side street near our office, the interior emitted damped and low-frequency, but still evident, rattles and squeaks. A couple of sharper bumps resulted in creaking from the dash. Considering how well Lexus nailed the rest of the car, this apparent build-quality problem was truly surprising.

Derivative best describes the styling, which to my eye incorporates a combination of past and present Mercedes-Benz cues. The overall effect is pleasing, if unremarkable. I prefer the more forceful appearance of a BMW 7 Series, sleek look of a Mercedes-Benz S-Class, classic image of a Jaguar XJ8 or refined visage of an Audi A8. ...
© Edmunds.com, Inc. ""

This article fully illustrates that the LS430 is a wonderful vehicle, but it is not on the same level ""BUILD QUALITY"" as its aspirational targets.

And brtmd, of course you no longer would even consider Buick, Lincoln, Oldsmobile, etc. That is entirely due to the fact that Lexus has supplanted what those brands once represented to American car buyers. My assertion is that the fact that you looked at Lexus as your alternative to German brands and not the former American luxury brands is indicative of where Lexus has gained their share."
1719,"October 22, 2002 4:18PM",glamourlife,"I already defended the statement with several examples. If you choose to ignore them, that is on you. I have no reason to cause a diversion. I own a Lexus, and I will readily admit that it is a very luxurious, comfortable, reliable, and capable ride. However in my experiences and as the articles I cut and pasted illustrate, it is not some marvel of engineering or perfection of MB, BMW, and Audi as you all are so quick to believe.

It has a recurring and nagging buzz that the dealer is loathe to even admit to. It also has way less power and performance than any of its competitors(Range Rover, G500, Navigator, Escalade, X5, etc.).

Again, I have stated repeatedly in every post that I have made that Lexus' are reliable, good values, and very luxurious. However, that does not mean they are innovative in styling, performance, design, safety, or any of the other truly relevant characteristics of automobiles. Furthermore they have a dated portfolio of vehicles with no new product news except for the GX470 and rumored demise of my LX470."
1720,"October 22, 2002 5:07PM",ljflx,"An Edmunds reviewer prefers edgier styling and that is a verdict for you. Styling is a personsal and subjective opinion and nothing more. The guy writes ""so perfect is the car that the few nits he has are silly"" and that is a poor verdict??. He states that his car exhibited a lot of creaking, rattling and buzzing. Now I wonder if that buzzing was the same ""barely"" discernible buzz he heard from the rear headliner.

If you read the S-class board you'll see many complaints about rattles and squeaks. If you read the LS430 board you'll see that our biggest problems are coins and cd's sloshing around making noise. That and the stereo is the only interior noise you really hear. Maybe the Edmunds reviewer had a bad car. I'm sure Lexus cranks one out now and then. I haven't had a rattle in my cars since I started buying Lexus in 95 and I hardly think that the Edmunds car is representative of LS430's being squeak or rattle prone. Sorry - the body build on this car is spectacular.

This all started with you saying Lexus wasn't in this league and had a cheap interior. Keep trying - I'm sure you'll find someone who agrees with you somewhere sooner or later."
1721,"October 22, 2002 6:13PM",glamourlife,"Funny how you conveniently left out AMG!!!!! Its easy and irrelevant to compare base model MB's with top of the line Lexus. The LS430 is supposed to be the Lexus flagship. A more accurate comparison would be with the S55 or even the S500, not the entry level S430. The new E500 and impending E55 exposes the GS430 for the pretender fake BMW/MB wannabe that it really is. And let's not even bring up M3's, M5's, S4's, S6's, or S8's. Lexus' are way underpowered and out of their league compared to any of these cars.

The LX470 has 230HP. You don't think that's underpowered for your flagship SUV? Compare that with an Escalade, G55, Range Rover, X5 4.6, or any other premium SUV.

Infiniti, Acura, Jaguar, and Cadillac are creating more innovative product than Lexus, And BMW, MB, and Audi are in another league.

And all of you who claim to have purchased the Lexus over ""competitive"" BMW, Audi, and Mercedes models know that only one factor was the key reason, PRICE! All I can say is happy motoring to all of you. Enjoy your cars and keep telling yourself how much better they are than any car ever created. If you repeat it long enough, it might actually come true. I doubt it though."
1722,"October 22, 2002 6:44PM",airmatic,"if Lexus built a LS-car comparable to the S55, it would probably cost the same price as the S-class or 745Li. Then, the buyer would probably want to buy the BMW.

The LS430 only comes in one model, whereas the S-class comes in 4 in the US. It cannot compare to the S55 AMG in terms of performance. however, In my opinion, the LS430 is the perfect balance of power, luxury, reliability and most importantly, VALUE.

In fact, have you ever driven a S500? In my opinion, I find the LS430 at the same par, if not, faster and more nimble than the S500. My friend has a 2002 S600, and to be quite honest with you, I would feel just fine behind the wheel of a LS430 (LS430 has plenty of power; the S600's performance is a bit too much for me, and in my opinion, it isn't worth for the car-buyer to pay above $100,000 for it).

Can we all just get along, and stop fighting over a discussion that is now pointless will never end?

I have owned my S430 for over about 6 months now, and I am now regretting that I didn't purchase the accesory AMG wheels. I didn't think that paying $5000 was justifiyable, so I opted for the standard wheels. Now, at my kids school, there are several S-class with chrome AMG rims. I am told that standard AMG are about $2,400 and chrome are $5,000. I am considering whether to get the alloy or chrome AMG... Is it worth paying almost double of the alloys to get chrome?..."

As for me, I will continue to try to speak from my own experience and not pretend to be omnipotent.

airmatic: agreed--pointless; I like the chrome wheels on my LS and have thought they look sharp on the S class--but they are expensive for something essentially aesthetic. However, there may be a very minor performance benefit moving to the AMG wheels if they reduce unsprung weight."

It is ridiculous to bring in a virtually custom made and very low production car vs. a stock car in any comparative power testing. Get real. By the way you only need 5 digits for worldwide AMG sales and the first digit starts with a number lower than 2. Now instead of you relying on AMG's to win your power argument lets compare the base MB models that represent 98% of their US and worldwide sales.

Even in 1990 people didnt see US makes as equal to German imports and therefore the people who rushed to the Lexus dealership were people who would have considered a MB or a BMW (although that is a stretch) not a cadillac. Lexus made a big splash but i dont see them gaining any more ground a this point. Lexus offered you a MB like car with a better price and better quality. Their quality is still superior to German cars but people are over that now. MB, BMW and Audi are coming out with better products all the time and by this time next year Cadillac's lineup will be solid. Lexus needs something to stand out from the pack. If you subtract one vehicle, the RX300, their sales arent even that impressive. None of the other luxury makes are so reliant on one model, except maybe cadillac with the deville. The RX300 was innovative at the time and is selling well as far as I know but the compact lux SUV market is much tougher now than it was in '98. In other words the RX's best days are behind it and they will need another hit vehicle to sustain that #1 or #2 position. I think next year BMW will be #1 and Cadillac will be #2 in sales."

1732,"October 23, 2002 3:39PM",footie,"I think it was Glamourlife that said that Edmunds had a review of the LS430 where the driver said it had rattles and buzzes.

I read everything on the Edmunds board for the 2001 and 2002 LS430 and found nothing but effusive superlatives gushing from the reviewers.

1734,"October 23, 2002 5:22PM",maxhonda99,"1487, Lexus sales are not reliant on the RX300. Lexus was reliant a few years back when the previous ES300 was aging but the RX300 thru calender year 2002 makes up 31% of Lexus sales.

Here's a breakdown:
RX300 31%
ES300 31%
LS430 11%
SC430 6%
GS300/400 7%
IS300 9%
LX470 4%

That shows Lexus sales are hardly reliant on just the RX300. And remember, The GX470 is right around the corner, as well as a new redesigned RX300 and LX470 not to mention for 2004 a new GS-series.

I love the pesimistic attitude that people have about Lexus; comments like ""If you take away this one model, Lexus sales are nothing"", or ""BMW, Mercedes, AUdi are coming up with better products all the time and by next year Cadillac's lineup will be solid"". Do you forget one thing? BMW, Mercedes Audi aren't the only ones coming up with better products, Lexus products are also constantly improving as are now Infiniti's. Lexus expanding product line is constantly expanding and becoming more solid year by year, as next year will be the intro. of the GX470 as well as all new RX300, '04 the GS-series and for '04 the SC330. ANd really what is going to make Cadillac's lineup so darn impressive next year? The CTS I like, it's a very nice car. But the SRX cross-over will come out. ANd a new Seville for '04 I believe. That's not really enough to catapult them over Lexus in sales, especially considering what I pointed out above about new model introductions coming next year.

I have never heard a young person even refer to an LS430 as a car they would desire."" I also don't hear may your people refer to a Deville or a Seville as car they would desire. There is a better chance of a young one desiring a LS430 over a Deville or Seville, for example."

1737,"October 24, 2002 11:25AM",glamourlife,"One point I want to clarify though, I never said Lexus has terrible interiors, I just said more flash, gloss, etc. than substance. If the plush gawdy thing floats your boat, go for it. Its just that the shinyness does not equate with build quality and durability.

The interior of any new MB, BMW, or Audi may not employ as many gawdy materials as Lexus, but that does not mean they have lower build quality. In fact I am arguing the reverse is true.

In any event, I am tired of all the personal attacks. What would I stand to gain from fabricating an Edmunds review? Don't you think the host would call me on it?

Also, yes I have driven a S500 extensively. I have also driven a LS430. And in my opinion, yes the Lexus is amazingly serene, plush, and luxurious, however, it is still an imitation of an authentic.

And as for the LX470, I enjoyed my time with it, and I agree with the comment made about SUV's in general. We recently traded the LX470(last night), and I now have a 2003 E500.

I dont know, but if I were going to pay what, roughly $54,000+, i would get a LS430 (GPS... Mark Levinson sound...) I mean, GPS and a CD-player is optional on the E500...

But then, everyone has their own ideas and thoughts, and that was mine.

I have a feeling the GX will be a disappointment just based off the styling.

On another note, if you really felt that the 2003 E had cheap plastics, then MB will never be able to get it right in your eyes. I feel the 2003 E interior is like a baby ""Maybach"" in terms of quality of materials. I did force my husband to look at the LS to replace the truck. We could have received a substantial discount too. I also must admit that the DVD nav and Mark Levinson setup are the best in the business, but the copycat styling, glossy interior, shiny plastics, and lack of a personality killed it overall."

1741,"October 24, 2002 3:30PM",sweetjeldorado,"The problem with the LX 470 is its Toyota sibling Land Cruiser is probably killing it in sales since it is the same truck. Most people would buy the Cruiser at $50,000 alot quicker than a $60,000+ LX 470. They look too much alike except the front view and you could not tell the difference if the badges and emblems were totally removed. So, it probably makes more since to get a Land Cruiser.

Personally for more luxury features, I would choose the Lexus but other than that it does not sell as well now days.

Several years ago, sales monthly was a little over 1,000+ now they are at between 500-600 or so.

Also too Lexus is beginning to be like Ford and Chevelot. How come they have to have several truck models. That is ridiculous. Think about it, RX 300 (Camry based), GX 470, and LX 470. Lexus only needs a car base truck and a pure truck base SUV like Cadillac with its SRX and Escalade variants is enough for any luxury automaker.

1742,"October 24, 2002 4:40PM",1487,"maxhonda:

I stand corrected about the RX300's sales but I still maintain that Lexus will continue to fall down the sales list. Lexus vehicles have no sense of style and they are no longer the bargains they used to be because the other automakers continue to come out with lower priced luxury vehicles to increase sales. The new Rx300 isnt going to make nearly the impact of the first one. When the first one came out it had no competition except the ML320. Next year the RX330 will compete with the X5, ML, SRX, Envoy, XC90 and MDX. IN other words the competition will be much stiffer. CAdillac is right behind Lexus this year in sales, BMW is first, ad the SRX will be enough to push it past lexus next year or the year after. The SRX fills a major hole in the lineup and unlike the RX300 it will be something new and fresh. Cadillac's lineup is smaller and older than Lexus' lineup and it's still close to lexus in sales. Once you add the ESV, XLR and SRX it wll be good position to pass lexus. The new GS and RX are replacement models, not an expansion of lexus lineup.

How old is old? I am talking 50s and 60s. I have seen many Deville drivers who looked to be in their 40s or early 50s. Most LS430 drivers ae beyond retirement in this area. I think they went from Buicks to the LS430. To be honest, the lexus model I hear the most about from people my age is the RX300. The Es is horrible looking (also a favorite of guys in their 60s), the GS is dated and the RX looks like a civic with big wheels. On styling alone I think BMW, MB and CAdillac will outsell cadillac next year. BTW, BMW has four models coming out next year and two of those will be affordable. If you erase the Lexus price advantage it starts to lose its luster compared to the prestigous German marques."

1749,"October 24, 2002 6:51PM",ljflx,"Since the average Lexus buyer is 53 years old (by the way the average MB buyer is 52) there must be a lot of teenagers driving Lexus cars to get the average down based on your stats. The last time I had my LS430 in for service there wasn't a person over 50 dropping off a car. I also got a newly created Lexus magazine in the mail today and the ads in it - Brioni suits, Nieman Marcus etc - are not aimed at the demographics you speak of. What exactly is your source of data?

Glamourlife - the new Jag interior must also look glossy and gawdy to you since it looks like a Lexus derivative or should I say copy. Regardless it's beautiful, maybe even beats the LS430 - and I'm not a Jag fan. That is the quality interior an $80+k MB should have."

1751,"October 25, 2002 7:36AM",maxhonda99,"See, the pessimism continues. I basically have issues with your entire post.
First and foremost, let’s begin at continue to fall down the sales list. How long has Lexus been falling down
The sales list? Year to year, sales have been rising for over the last five years. Not just that but in 2000 & 2001 I believe, Lexus was the best selling luxury nameplate in the United States, ahead of Mercedes & BMW, and far ahead of Cadillac & Lincoln. And BMW is probably going to sell more cars in the United States for 2002, but not by much. And Lexus & BMW will still be far ahead of Cadillac in terms of sales figures for 2002. This is of course in a recession. Despite your pessimism, I’m a bit more optimistic and realistic in that you can expect, if the economy holds steady, that Lexus sales-with the introduction of new products during the 2003 model year, will go grow even further. I apologize for bursting your bubble, but don’t expect Cadillac to gain that much ground, considering they will merely have the new SRX and XLR(Low-production) next year. I would still expect Cadillac sales to grow by about 5K to 6K units a month next year due to these 2 products.

Yes, the RX300 had minimal competition when it first came out, but since last year when the RX300 was in it’s 4th year, the RX300 had plenty of competition-the ML line grew since 1998 from just the ML320 to the ML430 and M55, the X5 came out, the MDX was introduced, Toyota’s own Highlander came out, and it’s had the Infiniti QX4 as competition. Yes, RX300 sales are still strong and it’s still outsells the MDX(which is better), the ML-class & X5.

Gimme a break, Cadillac sales are off about 30K units thru Sep-02. I see 145K units thru Sep-02 vs. 176K for Lexus thru Sep-02. Cadillac is hardly right behind Lexus or BMW. “Right Behind” would be proper if it was said
Lexus was “right behind” BMW in sales. While I am talking about sales figures, let’s discuss Deville fleet sales to limo companies and the sort. A further inflation of sales figures.

How old? I have seen people around age 30 to 40 driving Deville’s. But, a shock, they are all driving cars that they don’t own but Deville’s which their employers own, the Limo companies. Otherwise, I basically see 50+ set driving Deville’s. While on this topic, let’s not fail to point out that most people in their 30, 40s, or even 50s can afford $60K+ cars, which means you shouldn’t even be comparing the Devilles demographic age group to the LS430’s age group. The Average deville transaction price is probably a good $20K lower than a LS430’s. BTW, how many 40 year olds do you see driving a S-class around or a 7-series? Not a whole lot. Why? Similar to above, not a whole lot of people in the 40 to 50 age group can afford $70K cars. Psst. You generally have to have more $$$ to buy a LS430, S-class, or 7-series. And $$$ usually comes thru acquisition(working).

The ES300 is no beauty queen, but let’s get real, the CTS is one of the ugliest cars, IMO, in the automotive industry. Styling is subjective, so let’s not go there, since obviously Lexus styling clicks with more people that Cadillac styling does.

“If you erase the Lexus price advantage it starts to lose its luster compared to the prestigous German marques” The same can be said about Cadillac. If you erase Caddy’s price advantage it loses even more luster compared to luxury cars that are actually prestigious."
1752,"October 25, 2002 9:18AM",brtmd,"zachmbenzfvr: Saw the info on the website. The S is a great looking vehicle (still). The wheels in the photos are killer. Although I'm pretty sure I saw some light reflecting off of a gawdy piece of plastic in one of the interior photos.

Even if Lexus isn't thanking MB, I am. When I was recently out to replace the family vehicle (wife, 9 y/o, and 7 y/o), MB was (as usual) at the top of my shopping list with the new 7 series next. I decided to give the LS a look for the first time. What I found was that, in the full size ""premium luxury"" category, Lexus was building a better MB than MB. Not only that, I got to put $25k back in my pocket--best ""cheap rip-off imitation Mercedes-Benz"" I've ever found. Your comments reminded me of what my MB salesman said to me when I was evaluating the S class: ""It's [the S] a great car for someone who has to have the S."" If you are the kind of person who needs to have the extra perceived cache of the S, by all means pony up--it is also a very fine vehicle. (That didn't go up too far did it?)

BTW, in any other vehicle category I would have been sticking with MB or BMW (which one depends on the category as a result of variations in my priorities). Which means (gasp!) that I have found a tiny fragment of common ground with glamourlife: Congratulations on your new E500. A beautiful car IMO."

1756,"October 26, 2002 10:41AM",ejerod,"Geez.. when I said I was young I didn't mean to incite an age riot.. lol. You're right.. there aren't many 20-30 year olds driving any of these cars. My statement, as are all the statements here, was subjective. My point being that the younger generations do not like the styling of the LS430. But the demographic that Lexus targeted with that car was 47 year olds with an annual income of 200k. These are the people that can typically buy just about anything they want as far as a luxury car goes. So as far as hitting the target goes, Lexus has been successful. In fact I'd say Bullseye. I'm a private banker by trade with my own firm. I have quite a few wealthy young clients from entertainers to athletes. Of the hundreds I know that do own everything from Audi's to Lamborghini's ( and I'm talking about people that are under 40 in my client base) I only know 3 that own the LS430. No, it isn't a scientific survey by any means and I'm sure someone will find a hundred different articles or studies to argue a point, but that's my observation. The LS430 just looks too bland, whereas the BMW, MB, even Jaguars look like they can eat up asphalt, make a killer cappacino , and allow you to buy season tickets all without breaking a sweat. In the words of a friend of mine that's a professional race car driver. The S class may not be able to outperform a Porshe, but by the looks of it, you know it isn't scared to try. The LS430 on the other hand looks as though it will cower and cry for it's mother ."

1758,"October 26, 2002 1:59PM",1487,"i had too many typos in my last message and I apologize for that.

I dont see how the RX300 can be called a continuing success if it was selling close to 90K units a few years ago and is selling around 60K now. I don't know what the exact sales figures are but 31% of 200K sales is close to 60K a year. The new one will never hit the sales levels of the first model which was a pioneer.The SRX, X3 and other competition will limit it's success in the market.

Listen, I dont have a problem with old people buying cars, that's the media's problem. All I'm saying is that people need to acknowledge that Lexus models other than the IS and RX do not appeal to younger buyers. Now if you live in an area where no one drives anything that isnt an import (CA for example) I can understand why you think all people strive to own a Lexus but that isnt the case here. I have never seen an LS430 driver with hair that wasnt gray. The old model wasnt much better in that regard but this model seems to be a hit with retirees.

If Cadillac was to add 5 or 6K units a month next year it would surpass lexus in sales. Cadillac barely has a price advantage versus the Germans. They have nothing to compete with the 7 series or class but when you look at the prices of other models they arent cheap. The Deville's prce range is $42-58K, Seville $46K-57K, CTS $30K-$40K, escalade $50K-$56K. Next year Cadillac will have a model that is more expensive than any Lexus. We cant dispute who sells more cars but if you look at the average sale price of a CAdillac and a Lexus we know who will have the advantage. Most of Lexus' sales come from three models that cost under $40K and cadillac only has one model that sells for under $40K.

Also, I dont think anyone buys a lexus for the looks. Let's be realistic. Out of all the major Luxury makers Lexus has the worst styling. call it subjective if you want to but I never hear anyone that doesnt own a lexus call their cars attractive. The CTS isnt the best looking car but it is conveying a consistent theme which cant be said about any lexus. WHen you see the CTS next to the Slade and XLR it begins to make some sense. I would fix the rear end, but other than that it is a sharp and modern looking car. Lexus has no common design theme and as a result their cars do not match except for their grilles.

Cadillac, Infiniti and eventually Lincoln (hopefully) are going to do the same thing in the 2000s that Lexus did in the 90s. They are going to re-establish themselves with new products and performance and someon is going to pay in terms of sales. My guess is that Lexus is going to be the primary casualty."
1759,"October 26, 2002 3:04PM",ljflx,"Whenever the assembly line is re-tooled to produce a new design - as is the case right now with the RX300 - you have lower production and hence lower sales. The plant is operating usually at 33% less efficiency. That is also why the new model takes a while to reach full production after it is introduced. LS400 sales dropped to 14,000 in its last year and zoomed to 33,000 in 2001 with the new model. Don't read anything into sales stats in the last year of a model - its a production issue not a sales issue.

For Merc 1 - Acura Legend and please lighten up a bit. It was a great car. Like my 95 LS400 a friend bought it and took my 60k break-in miles to over 300k miles before the car started to have problems. The 95 LS400 has over 200k miles and is still functioning well. I must do something right when these cars are in their baby years though I do drive them hard and fast."
1760,"October 26, 2002 3:09PM",maxhonda99,"1487, wake up dude. Is the RX300 still not the SUV sales leader in it's market category? Which SUV out of them RX300, MDX, X5, ML, and QX4 sells in greater numbers? True the RX300 does not sell 90K units like it did in the first 2-3 years of its cycle, but 60K is still better than what the competition is selling, and most of the competition has newer models(MDX, X5) and the sales numbers still don't match the RX300. Not just that, but the RX300 is darn old. Compared to the MDX especially, it's smaller in just about every dimension, doesn't have the driving dynamics of the MDX, and is underpowered next to the MDX, but it still outsells it. I can see your continued pessimism being a hard-core Cadillac fan, but realistically, if a 5-year old SUV design is outselling newer better and similarly priced vehicles, what makes you think a totally new better newer similarly priced RX330 won't sell more than 60K units? Yes, Competition will limit the RX330's success, and I will even doubt the RX330 will sell 90K units a month, but neither will the MDX or Caddy SRX sell 90K a year because of the crowded entry level luxury SUV segment you speak of. On the other hand, you have to remember that the cross-over SUV segment is still growing(not like it was in the late 90s, but it's still growing) in the double-digit range.

Old people buying luxury cars is not the problem. Simply put, the older a person is, generally, the more expensive car that he/she can afford. Therefore, young people generally cannot afford big-buck luxury cars unless the young person is inherently rich, a pro sport player, a entertainer, a drug dealer, hit the lottery, or is extremely smart and well educated and makes tons of money at a young age. But obviously, we know that all those groups put together constitute a very small percentage of the luxury car buying public.

Everyone in here acknowledge's in here that older people buy Lexus cars, just like older people buy Cadillac, Lincoln, Mercedes, BMW, and Jaguar. What you have a failure acknowledging is that even less young people find any Cadillac model appealing than Lexus models.

Please take a survey if you go to college, or wherever and see how many young people(college aged maybe?, 20-30 age group?) and see what they would rather be driving, a Cadillac or a Lexus. Guaranteed results would be a vast majority would pick a Lexus over a Cadillac. I'm only 27, and I prefer Lexus far over Cadillac. In fact, out of all Luxury car makes Cadillac would be next to last right ahead of Lincoln. 1)BMW 2)Lexus 3)Audi 4)Infiniti 5)Jaguar 6)Mercedes 7)Cadillac 8)Lincoln.

The only Cadillac I like is the STS, because it hasn't gone to that lame new edge design philosophy yet. The CTS has awesome driving ability, but it's styling inside & out is hideous, what was Cadillac thinking?
On top of that I have many wealthy friends, some inherently rich, some to actually earned it in the computer industry the last few years, I don't see any of them with any cadillac product, but I do see them with Audi's, BMW's, Lexus', mostly BMW's though.

Yes, Cadillac will probably add 5-6K a month in sales. But you still fail(consistently) to realize that Lexus as well as BMW and Mercedes have new models coming out next year. In Lexus case, the GX470, a new RX330, a new GS330/430, and a SC330. As I know you so well from just a couple of posts, I know the response to come.

""Cadillac barely has a price advantage versus the Germans. They have nothing to compete with the 7 series or class but when you look at the prices of other models they arent cheap. The Deville's prce range is $42-58K, Seville $46K-57K, CTS $30K-$40K, escalade $50K-$56K.""

Cadillac has a big price advantage and dealers give huge discounts. $58K for a Deville. I think not. I have heard the DTS with the night vision is made in very few numbers. And again, here's the word, realistically, most Deville's are sold at the lower end of that price spectrum. Same with the Seville, and CTS. So really, Caddy does have a advantage, a big advantage(while you're at it don't forget to mention the 0% financing deal GM is throwing around). And the DTS's competition is basically itself. You're not going to see a whole lot of DTS buyers cross-shopping a LS430, S430, or 745il. It's just not going to happen. The DTS's competition is basically the Lincoln Town Car.

The Cadillac XLR will be more expensive than the Lexus SC430. What do you think that will do for Cadillac? You think it's going to be a better car than the Mercedes SL500? Do you really feel Cadillac will sell more than 1,000 units a month after the first few months? Do you really think most people who can afford a $70K+ car are going to jump from their SLs, XK8's to the XLR?

I bet Infiniti is going to improve alot in the coming years, I don't see the same with Cadillac. General Motors talked about beating the competition all thru the 90's, and it always never happened.

""Also, I dont think anyone buys a lexus for the looks. Let's be realistic. Out of all the major Luxury makers Lexus has the worst styling. call it subjective if you want to but I never hear anyone that doesnt own a lexus call their cars attractive. "" I also bet nobody buys a Cadillac for the looks then. And yes, styling is subjective-stated again.

BTW, why do you think all people strive to own a Cadillac?"

Good point about sales caused to retooling. Did not think about that. I believe the new RX330 is due out in the spring or summer of 2003, right?"
1762,"October 26, 2002 3:28PM",modernity,"The arguments here are really about two issues. One, which is better Lexus or MB. The other is which is better to own.

I don't know about you but when I get in my car every morning, I don't think if it's the sales leader, or if it has any family resemblance, or even if the competition is gonna catch up next year.... I just wanna get into a car I know I will enjoy... to drive, to look at and especially to own. Taken in context and with reasonable objectivity you cannot say a Mercedes is better than a Lexus.

As to the other angle; which is better Mercede or Lexus.... well that depends? There are so many angles one can look at a company that you could argue that Kia is better them both... get the point! So unless you can come up with a standard to measure which is better you are never gonna get a winner.... just opinions and more opinions"

I dont know any college kids who think of a Lexus, other than the SC430, as stylish. However, many college kids love the Cadillac style(except Deville). Everybody I know, except a select few, percieve Lexus as old people cars. If they were in a position to buy a Luxury Car, I would estimate the top three choices would be MB, Audi, and BMW...and Lexus and Lincoln would be last...with Cadillac somewhere in the middle."

No, you didn't say that I dont' think, but your fellow Lexus underlings have. Amazing.

Actually re-tooling has nothing to do with sales sliding, people simply hold-off buying a product they know is going to be replaced, and secondly sales of anything decline as the years go by. Toyota especially has no sales problems during re-tooling as they do it faster than just about anyone else. Have you ever been to the Camry plant?

1768,"October 27, 2002 6:02AM",maxhonda99,"wishnhigh, YOu didn't prove really anything. You're 1 person out of millions. You know it's a fact that the average ""young"" person would rather drive a foreign nameplate luxury car product over a Cadillac. It's simply a fact, otherwise soo many ""young"" People wouldn't be driving BMW 3-series.

modernity, Yes, some people have relegated the conversion to sales numbers. BUt you're right, it's not about sales figures as sales figures overall don't tell you the full picture. Even lousy products are successful(in terms of numbers sold)in the marketplace because of low price, availability, and marketing.

Which is better? you're right, no one can really say unanimously which car is better. Any car in the luxury segment is essentially a good car and basically there are differences between the many choices. And those differences suit different buyers in different ways.

In one way, you can say a Kia is better than anything. It does present a better value than any car possibly on the market. It basically provides what even a luxury car provides-transportation at 1/5 the price.

merc1, Actually re-tooling at any car plant affects sales to a certain degree. Re-tooling is a lenghty process in just about every auto plant and re-tooling begins to take shape months in advance of a new products introduction. To re-tool a factory a certain amount of current production capacity has to be sacrificed. But you are right, alot of the sales drop has to do with a products age."

i dont own any MB or Lexus products. I am too young and to poor to own any type for luxury car (well I could if I lived at home) but my understanding of the industry is unaffected by my limited financial means. I currently own my second car which is an Alero, my first car was a used suburu legacy (feel sorry for me yet?). I have driven many of these cars at various manufacturer sponsored events but I have never owned one and I wont for many years. I have no intentions of ever owning a MB or BMW because they are too numerous around these parts. I have nothing against the cars but I have never been a follower. I laugh when people try to use sales data or the average age of owners to prove that one company is superior to another. Please tell me what you do for a living that allows you to own an SL500, S500 and GS300 at age 39?

honda;

""dude"", you are in over your head here. You basically avoided dealing with the issues I mentioned and instead began trashing Cadillac. That is always a sign that a person has nothing substantive to add to the debate. You never answered my question about what part of the US you inhabit. it sounds like CA to me based on your import loving friends and your own closed minded attitude. I live on the east coast where people have made money the old fashioned way and the luxury cars are diverse. I am telling you that Lexus makes few vehicles that are desirable to young people in my area based on what I see on the street and what I hear from my peers. I am younger than you and I do not find any of Lexus' models to be physically appealing. The IS300 would be the best executed Lexus design in my opinion but it screams ""rice rocket"" and it looks juvenile. I cant believe that anyone who can say with a straight face that he finds lexus vehicles attractive can muster the nerve to criticize the CTS. Notice I NEVER said the CTS was beautiful, but I did say that its design is harmonious and purposeful. It could have been better executed in the rear but it is conveying a consistent design theme.

I will tell you that around here the two luxury vehicles held in the highest esteem amongst the younger crowd are probably the S-class and the Escalade. That may be due to rap videos or MTV's Cribs but really it doesnt matter where the prestige originated. I know people who think the Escalade costs $70K or more. That is the kind of prestige the SUV has among some young people. When I tell them they can own one for a mere $52K they are pleasantly surprised.

your entire dismissal of the pricing issue is ridiculous. 0% financing is not a discount on the price of a vehicle. In fact I would argue that Lexus uses high financing charges to make up for their lower price comparative to other luxury marques. It doesnt matter how many financing deals Cadillac offers, the average transaction price on a Cadillac is far higher than Lexus. I'm sure in your part of the world you dont see many Devilles (except at the airport) but I will tell you that a significant portion of Devilles are DTS models. When the car first debuted they had to increase the proportion of DTS made because the deman was higher than anticipated. In case you didn't know the DTS and DHS offer parallel pricing so any you see on the road could have cost anywhere from $50K-$56K. If you subtract night vision, which is a limited production option, the price could still run about $56K.

I cannot believe that you could honestly say that Infitni ranks higher than cadillac in terms of luxury status. that is not supported by sales numbers, nor technological achievements. Before the '02 Q45 debuted infiniti was never known for being on the cutting edge of anything. Sales notwithstanding, Cadillac, MB and BMW lead the luxury car industry in terms of new technology. Lexus, Jaguar, Acura and Infiniti are not on the same level. If you doubt that please provide some examples to counter my assertion. Cadillac has been pioneering technology for years and finally they have the guts to become a leader in performance. They are showing they are serious by going head to head the MB and BMW by developing manual trannys, the XLR, the CTSv with 350hp and later V series versions of the STS and SRX with twin turbo V8s. And lets not forget about the upcoming 500hp V-12. You say Gm as made these promises before, but you fail to mention that this promise is backed by confirmed products and $4 billion in capital. Meanwhile , Lexus is still beating us over the head with ""the relentless pursuit of perfection"" advertising and a lack of cohesive design strategy. When are they going to step up and try to challenge BMW and MB car for car? Truthfully, I dont think lexus cares about their reputation for performance or styling, they care about sales. As long as they are ahead in sales they arent going to truly challenge the benchmarks. Lexus is a first tier lux marque in terms of brand image and cute ads, but when it comes to innovation they are not amongst the leaders."

by the way, on friday, I finally replaced the wheels on the S430. got rid off the 16 inch ones and got the 18"" AMG chrome ones. decided that the regular rims were too small for the s-class, and got chrome ones because they look great on black.

1773,"October 27, 2002 1:17PM",pcbrs,"Hi-
It's interesting how you note that from your experience, MB and Cadillac are held in the highest regard in the East Coast ""youth crowd"", probably 20-40 demographics. I've lived in Boston for the past 6 years, and I can tell you that has not been my experience. I'm in my 20's, and have friends from 20-35 years of age. Most, if not all of them favor MB, BMW, and Lexus (RX300 and IS300). None of them, except for one out of over a hundred would even consider a Cadillac (lots of friends from college and med school). Among my friends, it's considered an older person's car. I guess your experience has been different. But this is just to show you how subjective individual cases and circumstances can be.

I was also confused by your last post. You wrote:
""I laugh when people try to use sales data or the average age of owners to prove that one company is superior to another.""

Then, a little later you state:
""I cannot believe that you could honestly say that Infitni ranks higher than cadillac in terms of luxury status. that is not supported by SALES NUMBERS, nor technological achievements.""

Anyway, I respect Cadillac, and they really didn't get the kudos they deserved for the Northstar system. Still, you may be right that Lexus doesn't innovate as prolifically as the other makers, but their execution of high end technology is without any peers.

1774,"October 27, 2002 1:41PM",stevestein,"While I was not asked, I'll answer your question anyway. I leased a C280 and E320, and took a hard look at an S430 before I got an LS430 in 2001. The bottom line for me is that there are just different philosophies behind the MB and Lexus ways of looking at cars. Trivial as it sounds, the cupholders tell the story. Even in the S class the cupholders will dump a drink in a large cup in your lap. In my C280 I had to buy a cupholder in the second year from the (then new) E class and have it installed. I believe that the MB engineers don't want you to drink anything and drive. Lexus is more accommodating to the creature comforts. I did have more mechanical problems with the MB than the Lexus, including a leaking head gasket and some other surprising problems for a young car (none went over 30K), but the service department was great and always provided a loaner (BTW a Taurus while I get a current Lexus from them).
Lexus just fits my personal desires more. I'd rather have the cupholder than an extra .01g lateral acceleration. That's why it strikes me as strange (and I'm far from a car enthusiast) that so many people here are so passionate and chauvinistic that one brand must be better than all others. It's America! The land of free choice. Each manufacturer makes a decision as to price/performance/features/mystique and develops a marketspace. The people who buy their cars feel comfortable in that space. Like the 7 series? Great. Love MB - good for you. Lexus makes you happy - enjoy. In the end everyone spends their own money, and there is no World Series or Super Bowl to declare a winner. Auto mags and Edmunds may try, but in the end the decision is still according to some arbitrary set of rules they decided upon that may emphasize things of no interest to me.
The bottom line is, when you do get your Mercedes, I truly hope it lives up to your every expectation and pleases you. I'll just stick to my Lexus for now."
1775,"October 27, 2002 1:54PM",magnetophone,"Well, all I can say to that is that the Germans simply don't drink while on the autobahn. Mercedes is about Germany, Lexus is about assimilating to American taste, which is entirely passionless and boring. Good for you if you want a reliable luxo-barge. I wholeheartedly agree with those here who put Lexus closer to Cadillac. I see plenty of LS430's here, and they're owned by older folks tootling in the left lane on the freeway at 55mph. In my opinion, they are cars for people who aren't really car nuts, with the exception of the IS300.

And I agree with most in here who say that young people don't consider Cadillac. They simply don't. I've seen a half dozen CTS' here since they came out. I've seen countless G35's, however, including my neighbors and a coworker who now owns them. The only place I think a Cadillac has a true desirability factor is in the poorer neighborhoods. Cadillacs are hot objects there, which is not a bad thing at all. Cadillacs are largely affordable, unloved luxury cars that can be had for chump change after they're off lease or after their owners can't drive anymore."

All that Cadillacs have is the Northstar. The styling is suspect, the FWD architecture of the Deville and Seville are suspect, as are their cheap interiors. There is no model in their lineup that is the class leader. Yes, many Cadillacs sold are over $40K, but consider that many of those $40K vehicles MSRP for $55K."

So are you

""You know it's a fact that the average ""young"" person would rather drive a foreign nameplate luxury car product over a Cadillac.""

Its a fact huh? Says who? I would like to see what your definition of ""fact"". Maybe when you are as young as I am again, you can tell me what young people like.

""It's simply a fact, otherwise soo many ""young"" People wouldn't be driving BMW 3-series.""

Okay, so you have proven that young people like the BMW 3 series. I never denied that. I fully agree! How many young people do you see driving ES300s again? I have seen more young people driving Cadillacs than I have seen driving Lexus. And yes I have seen many young people(18-25) driving Cadillacs, from older classic Caddys to new CTSs and Seville STSs, and especially Escalades.

I have seen two people my age, driving Lexi, and I know them personally. One got rid of his for a Mercedes ML500, the other still has his GS300.

Cadillac has a more young image in my mind, and while it is impossible to prove anything no matter how many numbers you can quote, I would say that at least here in California, Cadillac has a far younger image than Lexus.

Not that it means they are crappy cars. I think Lexus makes incredible cars, and they reshaped an entire industry because of it. I just dont think they appeal to young people, in any sense."
1781,"October 27, 2002 10:17PM",glamourlife,"In the youth pop culture right now, the two most esteemed vehicles probably are the S500 and an Escalade. The person that made a comment about Cadillacs only being desirable in ""poorer"" neighborhoods is way out of touch. ""Poorer"" neighborhoods are not behind the times. In fact from a marketing perspective they are the tastemakers and mavens of what's next. This has always been the case in fashion, music, culture, and most trends.

The resurgence in sales of luxury nameplates like Bentley has been driven in large part by the urban community. Ask MB who their first G500's and Maybachs were delivered to. At the top of the list will be professional entertainers, athletes, and urban entrepreneurs.

Cadillac is definitely on the rise. Their portfolio of impending new releases is impressive. Lexus on the other hand is still playing follower and waiting to see what MB and BMW will do next. Lexus does not have a single model that is aspirational to the under 35 set. Cadillac may have controversially styled vehicles, but they are aspirational to a large segment of youth culture. They have not reached the level of BMW and MB yet, but at one time they were, and who knows, they may someday return."

I've been trying my best to stay out of this who likes what conversation because it varies greatly by location, and by associations too (i.e. one's circle of friends, co-workers etc). But Pcbrs, did pose a good question about the use of or non-use of sales data to support your various theories. I actually agree with you on *some* of the things you've been saying, but you let me down with the blatant contradiction that pcbrs pointed out. And welcome back.

baron87,

You really need to give that tired ""they sell more 40K vehicles than anyone else"" rhetoric a rest. Who cares? Nobody, and I mean nobody sells as many 50K+, 60K+, 70K+ cars as Mercedes-Benz, so there. Now who's the real ""luxury"" brand? The poster meant that Cadillac isn't a competitor based on product not sales.

stevestein,

I agree totally, they're different cars..primarily because of their origin and philosphy. The cupholder issue is probably the best example of that, with Porsche literally refusing to do it, and it's easy to see that the Germans didn't want to do it, so they half-a__d the job. Some magazines are starting to realize this. My issue with the press is the insistance that everything must outhandle a BMW. It's getting out of hand. About me getting a Benz, thanks.

1786,"October 28, 2002 4:40PM",maxhonda99,"1487(dude):

My only trash of Cadillac came in it's styling. Not it's mechanic's or engineering or build. Again(since it evades you) styling is subjective. BTW, you have a propensity to trash Lexus as it is, so do not feel like nobody else can trash Cadillac, if you must consider my comments ""trashing"".

Really, no really you never asked where I lived. I live on the east coast(NJ), so I do not know where you are living, but up here other than Limo companies owning Deville's, I don't see many. And NJ is a bit like California in that it is the land of expensive luxury imports. I don't know where you live but if you ride on up the NJ turnpike and stop off in towns like Cherry Hill, Morrestown, then Mercer county, Monmouth county, Bergen County, Short Hills, and on up thru Parsippany and so on, the roads are littered with Mercedes, BMW, Lexus, Jaguar, Audi. And of course alot of Cadillac also. But Caddy is definately not the ""bomb"" car you make it out to be. I can drive to Boston, lots of friends there, nobody is driving a Cadillac.

""I am telling you that Lexus makes few vehicles that are desirable to young people in my area based on what I see on the street and what I hear from my peers. I am younger than you and I do not find any of Lexus' models to be physically appealing."" Again, dude, you seem to consistently miss the point(s) I made. You, remember you, do not find Lexus' models appealing. But I can again say that you put a Lexus in front of the average young person and a Cadillac in front of the average young person and that average young person would rather have the Lexus. The Cadillac would be at the bottom of the list.

When is the last time you went shopping for a Lexus that you know they charge high financing prices? ANd how is 0% financing not a incentive? Please, 0% IS a incentive to help blow out cars. I don't know what Lexus charges for interest rates, but if they are charging higher interest rates than what the average banks are charging, I would bet nobody would be leasing thru Lexus or 2) their sales wouldn't be growing every month.

Sorry, I don't buy the $56K figure. 1) I see you can buy the car for basically invoice even in NJ 2) I can see you can buy it for basically invoice off of Carsdirect.com 3) I don't see a whole lot of DTS's because alot of the ones I see are owned by the Limo companies and they definately aren't DTS's.

""I cannot believe that you could honestly say that Infitni ranks higher than cadillac in terms of luxury status. that is not supported by sales numbers, nor technological achievements. "" Again since this is also eluding you, let me point it out. Where these cars rank was IMO. I know you are the master of where cars rank(and cadillac is the king of 1487's automotive luxury hierarchy). IMO means which car makes I would consider in order. Infiniti is primarily based on the G35. Much better car than the CTS in just about every way for less money. And it will run circles around a CTS.

""You say Gm as made these promises before, but you fail to mention that this promise is backed by confirmed products and $4 billion in capital."" Haven't they? All through the 90s? the STS was supposed to beat it's competitors from BMW, Mercedes, & Lexus in terms of quality, performance, and Luxury. Wasn't it? Has either generation of the STS from the 90s done that? What about the current CTS? From every comparison test I have read, it rates quite low. The XLR-has anyone driven a production version yet? I also think it will be a good car and it's the only good looking Cadillac I can see in the forseeable future, but really how many people do you think will pony up upwards of $70K for a Cadillac? $4 billion in capital means nothing if you can't EXECUTE.

""When are they going to step up and try to challenge BMW and MB car for car? "" I believe Lexus has more cars to compete with more of BMW & mercedes products that Cadillac does.

Let's start, shall we? The IS300 competes with the BMW 3-series & MB C-class.
THe ES300 competes with the BMW 3-series & C-class
the LExus GS300 competes with the 525i & 528i, E320
The Lexus GS430 competes with the 540i, E430
The Lexus LS430 competes in between the BMW 5 & 7-series and Mercedes E & S-class but more towards the 7 series & S-class
The RX300 competes with the ML320, X5
the LX470 competes with the ML430 X5 4.4i(kinda)

What cars does Cadillac have that compete head to head in any category with Lexus, BMW, or Mercedes?
Cadillac made fabulous claims that it would handle better than the 5-series, yet in every test I've seen, Cadillac doesn't seem to measure up to the 5-series. The Seville's competition is supposed to be the 5-series, E-class, and GS-series. The Deville competes with nothing from Benz, BMW, or Lexus. The Deville basically competes with the Town Car. And the Escalade is too large to compete with either the X5 or ML430.
So, where is Cadillac's model for model competition to BMW, & Mercedes?

""Lexus is still beating us over the head with ""the relentless pursuit of perfection"" advertising and a lack of cohesive design strategy. When are they going to step up and try to challenge BMW and MB car for car? Truthfully, I dont think lexus cares about their reputation for performance or styling, they care about sales. As long as they are ahead in sales they arent going to truly challenge the benchmarks.""

Bingo. Sales. Isn't that what Cadillac cares about also but can't seem to pull off, increased sales? What else do you think corporate america is about? selling fewer products?

Challenging the benchmarks. Explain to me how Cadillac has challenged the benchmarks? Oh, I forget they haven't. Lexus builds the LS430 which competes head to head with the S-class and 7-series-and according to people who drive it, it actually does compete with them. Can the Deville compete with the LS430? Not the last time I checked. The GS430, in every comparison I've read, competes with the benchmark 540i. Does the Seville? The IS300 competes with the 3-series, and it actually even wins some comparison tests against the 3-series. Does the CTS?

Lexus has challenged and continues to challenge BMW & mercedes. Cadillac has not in a long time. If you say they may challenge them in the few coming years, I could buy that. But saying they have challenged them or are currently challenging them is a farce. Cadillac doesn't have one product that is a benchmark or close to being a benchmark currently.
-The CTS doesn't excel at anything whether it be luxury or performance. The ES300 does-at being a luxury car.
-The Seville doesn't excel at anything either-it can't outperform a GS430, E500, or 540i.
-The Deville can't touch the S-class, LS430, or 745i in terms of performance or luxury.

Also, if you have proof that shows that the average young person prefers a Cadillac over a lexus, Benz, BMW, or Audi, be my guest and show me that st"
1787,"October 28, 2002 5:08PM",maxhonda99,"merc1, HOw can you basically say retooling doesn't affect sales & output? YOur favorite, Mercedes Benz can give a example. the recent launch of the new E-class. The past few months, sales were dwindling, and I think in aug & sep they only sold about 2K a month. Even in it's 5th model year, the E-class would have sold at about double that rate had it not been for retooling.

And Camry sales also sagged when the 2002 Came out. IT is true factories can be retooled quicker today than anytime in the past, and Toyota can do this really quick, but a totally new product means production will decrease. I know for a fact, when my friend recently bought a Accord, the dealer had next to nothing of the 2002 models because they were getting no shipments. Again similar situation, if Honda dealers had them, they could have still sold all of the 2002 models that they could have gotten."

your post is so long that I cant begin to respond to all your points. Just keep this is mind: you are putting words in my mouth regarding Cadillac. I have never said the CAdillac makes better cars than lexus, I never said that Cadillac has a younger clientele than Lexus, I never said cadillac competes better with the Germans than Lexus, the list goes on and on. You are too sensitive when it comes to Lexus and you are on the defensive. The fact remains that Lexus products lack the styling or performace to appeal to younger buyers. The average Lexus owner is probably younger than the average cadillac owner and for that I congratulate you and Lexus. It doesn't change the fact that many young people would take an Audi, BMW, VW or MB over a Lexus. Other than the IS I cant imagine what lexus products you and your friends are attracted to. I'm sure you live in an area with a lot of young web developers who sip starbucks and wear prada loafers and that is fine. However, common sense should (and I say SHOULD) tell you that your area can't be representative othe country because cadillac is third in sales this year and according to you they dont sell any cars in North Jersey. I live in Phila. and I have seen dozens of CTS' so far and I have seen innumerable Escalades and EXTs. I see a lot of everything except Bentleys and Ferraris, but I see those too. Also,my ex-college roomate is 25 and can't stand VW's, Audis or Lexi. To him they represent interner wealth and yuppyism (if that were a word)and he has a Hi tech job outside of Princeton. He hasn tbought a new car but he told me a while ago he would consider a cadillac because he wants something different.

You need to do more research and less exaggerating. You say the CTS has finished low in every comparison review you've seen? It finished behind the 330, IS and A4 in C&D but they didnt have much bad to say about the car. The general consensus is that it needs more power and a better interior. Both will be addressed next year and both could be applied to your beloved IS300. You are basically saying that the car is a relative failure but I dont see what you are basing that on, most reviews have been positive.

Also, why would the Deville be better than the S500 or 745 when it costs about $15K-$25K less than those cars? Again, please apply some common sense. Your sales price argument continues to be impotent. Like I said before, finacing deals do NOT reduce the price of a car. I will accept your latest argument about caddys being sold near invoice but I will REPEAT that most cadillacs sold cost more than most Lexus models sold. You can talk about financing, incentives, invoice prices and everything else but you cant change that fact. Cadillac has more room to play with its pricing because it makes so much money on its vehicles (about $700 million) and they cost more than Lexus vehicles except for the LS430 and SC430. BTW, your lexus to BMW/MB comparisons are a joke. YOu honestly believe that an LS430 competes with te S-class, 7 series or 5 series? Do you really think the ES300 is a competitor to the 3 series? Anyone considering a 3 series is sure as hell not going to consider an ES300 for mny reasons. The CTS may not be perfect but it is much more like the 3 than the ES300 will ever be. I doubt any MB/BMW fanatic (and there are some here) would agree with your lexus-biased comparisons.

""$4 billion in capital means nothing if you can't EXECUTE.""

Did you not read anything I wrote? Next years intros include a 315hp roadster, a 350hp RWD sedan with 6 speed manual, a new 260hp engine for the CTS and a 315hp AWD American X5..........That doesnt sound like executing you? dude, if you hate cadillac that is you perrogative but you are being ridiculous. Why cant you just acknowledge that they finally have a gamplan. You dont have to like the cars but you cant deny they are taking the right steps.

""Bingo. Sales. Isn't that what Cadillac cares about also but can't seem to pull off, increased sales? What else do you think corporate america is about? selling fewer products? ""

Cadillac's sales are up about 16% or so this year, again do some research. Also, as i have pointed out before to others their lineup is one of the smallest in the luxury industry. They are holding on to third place with FOUR products.

merc1:

My statement about Infiniti makes sense. He said that Infiniti ranked above cadillac and I was saying that by ANY measure that wasnt true. You can measure it by sales, by rankings in magazines, by the number of innovations, brand image, average price of vehicles, by awards given or anything else. He cannot back that statement up. Audi sells less cars than caddy but they have a superior image, that cannot be said for Infiniti and I was merely saying that the SIZABLE difference between caddy sales and infiniti sales reflected that. I didnt mean to disappoint you, I didnt realize you were rooting for me.

magnetophone:

I dont know where you live but cadillacs are not only popular amongst the ""urban"" aka ""poor"" crowds. While many young rappers and atheletes are buying up escalades most cadillacs are bought by older working (or retired) people who are upper middle class like yourself. You say they are cheap? Well I would love to make enough money to call cadillacs cheap. BTW, most ""poor"" people as you call them cant afford a cadillac or any other luxury car. MBs and Bentleys pop up in the driveways of many rappers and NBA players but I don't hear you saying they are only popular in ""poor"" areas.

I've never seen a young person driving a brand new Cadillac. Maybe in other regions things are different, but Cadillacs are not prevalent here, and those that are are base Devilles driven by older folks.

Again, all this song and dance about what Cadillac is about to bring out in 2003,4,5,6 is pointless until it actually happens. Where was Cadillac in 1996 when the Z3 came out? Or in 1997 when the ML320 came out? Where is an AWD Cadillac (besides the Escalade)? Where is a Cadillac station wagon, or a Cadillac with electronic braking?

Cadillac's resurgence is only contingent on their products actually existing in real time. The XLR is about to come out soon, but there's no way to tell if it's going to make an impact yet or not. Even then, they did not build an SL competitor. They built a car that competes with a CLK500 in price and is generally just a large RWD convertible. I don't see how they really redefined the sector. They're doing the same thing Lexus is doing, providing reasonable alternatives at lower prices. The difference is, Cadillac doesn't have Lexus' reputation of reliability."
1797,"October 29, 2002 1:13AM",magnetophone,"It's as simple as this - Cadillac has not created a car in the past 20 years or so that has become a trendsetter and copycat to other luxury brands. This is an essential for a true luxury brand that is setting an example.

Here's a few examples. In the mid 70's, the S-class, and E-class Mercedes set a standard in contemporary luxury design. It was emulated by everyone from the Cadillac Seville to the Ford Granada to some of the upper level Alfa Romeo sedans, if you want to be broader in your interpretation. The barge with the bank-like vault started with these cars.

Mercedes did it again with the 1980's model S-class and the 1990's version (which Lexus so dutifully copied with their current LS430).

BMW caused round headlights to become cool again, and the 3-series re-created the personal luxury coupe. Suddenly the CLK appeared, and Audi had to bring over a cabriolet model.

Audi's brand DNA has been copied to some extent from everything from the Lexus SC430 to the Ford Mondeo to the Proton Impian (if you know what one of those are.) If there are any two brands have caused true impact in the past decade, it's Audi and BMW.

Audi created the necessity for the clean, Bauhaus exterior, the high-quality interior which was so uncommon in the 1990's, and BMW reinvented the desire to have RWD sports sedans and coupes, whether we really wanted them or not.

What has Lexus done? Well, nothing in the styling department, but it has made the other brands learn what quality is supposed to be.

What has Cadillac done? I certainly don't see Art and Science showing up on the 2004 Audi TT, the 2005 Ford Five Hundred, or the 2005 Mercedes S-Class!

We haven't converted our E-classes to front wheel drive! We haven't installed heads-up displays in Audi A6's! We haven't seen a truck-like SUV based on the EuroVan show up rebaged as an Audi! We haven't seen carriage tops, column-mounted shifters, or BVLGARI instruments appear inside Lexi have we?

magnetophone:

your post about cadillac not being a trendsetter was pointless. First off you mention a bunch of things that Cadillac just adopted and then say ""I dont see anyone else copying them so they arent a top Luxury marque"". How could anyone copy art & science after a year? Cadillac is trying to be different, they arent trying to design cars than can easily be copied. You give a lot of credit to BMW and Audi for setting trends that they didnt set. The Japanese luxury cars were the ones that forced the Germans to design inviting, logical interiors, not vice versa. The interior of a '92 Lexus was far better than the interior of any '92 Audi, MB or BMW. Look at some old motor trends if you dont believe me. While many companies have copied the handling of BMWs I dont see evidence of them copying BMWs styling or drab interiors (only recently brightened up with wood and metal accents) full of small buttons and red back lighting. The interior of the Ls430 looks better than any German interior to me, and yes Audi is included.

You people are killing me with your XLR trashing. The car is going to be very limited production and cost thousands less than the XKR and SL500 and yet I keep hearing that no one will buy it because its a cadillac. Is that why the $85K Nieman Marcus models sold out in 14 minutes? People are saying that the car wont sell because its too expensive and its cadillac but there is no mention of the nice styling, the 315 hp engine and the state-of-the-art technology. Can anyone give me a REAL reason why it isnt an SL or XK8 competitor? Not everyone is a follower and I wish you people would get that. The car will sell because many people will want to be the first in their area to have one."

1810,"October 29, 2002 4:22PM",sweetjeldorado,"How do you guys find the time to post so much?

Maxhonda,

I been out of school twelve years now and back then, my favorite luxury automaker was a Cadillac and still is to this day. Cadillacs were pure luxury back then in 1990 and '91 when I begin to take interest in the product. I don't care for Mercedes or BMW back then. I thought they were ugly as sin except few of the models. I like them (luxury imports) a lot better now but if I had a limited amount of income to choose between the STS, S500, or 745Li, I would choose the STS. Although the S500 and 745Li maybe a better car than the STS and in another league, the STS is an excellent luxury car without explaining itself to anyone.

magnetohpone,

What you said about Cadillacs being seen in poorer neighborhoods is somewhat spot on. That might been one of the reasons why I liked Cadillacs so much but calling them chump change is way off base. Most Cadillacs around here are driven by older people but more than 1/4ths. of age groups driving older models are younger people.

However Matt, in the future, what you said about Cadillacs being driven by poorer people seems to be racist if you know what I mean. In poorer neighborhoods, African Americans predominantly live in those neighborhoods. Although you did not say that but anyone can read between the lines. So base on what you see, don't create a stereotype if you don't have a clue what's going on around you. I can easily say only white people drive BMWs and Porches out of ignorance which is false so clean up your posts a bit, please.

Now to anyone, you guys need to stop being critics. I can tell you several number of Cadillacs that does get crossed shop between the high end competitors. It may not happen as commonly like the LS 430 between S 500 and 7 series but it does happen. The DTS may not be cross shopped according to you guys but it does and I can tell you some posters and their friends chose a DTS over a BMW, Lexus and Mercedes. So, if the car meets certain peoples needs so beat it if Cadillac won them over from Lexus or Mercedes.

Also for those people that suppose to be rich on here that did not look at a Cadillac. Guess what, some percentage of people that are rich would never consider driving a Mercedes, Bentley, Rolls, BMW, or Lexus over a Cadillac also. So you guys need to stop giving in stereotype and just worry about the automaker you like so much and cherish the car you are driving right now and stop speculating so much.

Again, I will tell you this like I would tell any of my friends that Cadillac, IMO, makes the best looking cars than anyone. Just about all the Cadillacs currently are drop-dead gorgeous and I can't say the same much about the luxury imports except a few. That is the reason I like Cadillac so much because of styling. So, take it whatever you want but that is my bias opinion.

Lexus cars are nice but no excitement in styling and always tend to follow.

Mercedes are nice especially the gorgeous SL 500/55 but Mercedes does not stand out anymore because they are being copied off of by anyone from Asian like Lexus and Acura.

BMWs creating a new regime like Cadillac is in styling but their cars are funky looking to me like the new 7 and Z4.

Jaguars have the most beautiful interior designs in its class but the exteriors are too old school and boring. I can't understand why anyone one consider the exterior of the Jaguars gorgeous anyhow. They simply are not.

Audis are cutting edge in All-wheel drive and looks to be a contender in a few years but shared platforms a little too much like VWs. is turning me off.

So, therefore Cadillac is the leader in styling direction, among the top in technology and best of all. They are original and they never imitate or duplicate. That is why I like them so much.

Obviously you haven't been paying attention, I said that I'm tired of magazines ranking cars below BMWs soley because of handling. If you read some of my other posts I usually more or less agree with MOST comparo's. In the case of this class of cars (SC430, SL500, XK8/R and XLR) handling isn't going to be as big of a deciding factor and better yet BMW isn't even competing in this class. Pay closer attention.

Nieman Marcus can sell anything in a hot moment. When the XLR goes 3 years with constant sales it will be a success. The list of fallen-off cars at these prices is a long one, SC400, NSX, 850Ci etc and you can probably add the SC430 to the list by 2004. The previous SL didn't have such a problem, with 1997 (it's 8th(!) model year) being it's best year. Thats success.

Can you enlightened us on the connotation of what the letters stand for? Remember in the CTS topic of how screwed up the Cadillac naming has been. Now what does C in ""C Class"", E and S in model classes stand for. I think if I recall you said SL stands for ""small light"" or sport light"".

On the Phaeton and new A8, the side profile looks very similar. However, I don't think I would spend $70,000 on it and I could get the A8. By the looks of the pictures, I am not too sure I really like the looks of the car (A8). I prefer the current A8 model which is very classy and elegant. The Phaeton to me is a touring car that is not sporty at all but on the inside, it is in another league of its on. Also too, I think the current A4 is gorgeous. I can see myself in this car as well. I don't know if you agree or not but is it me or is it that every time I use the word gorgeous about cars, cars look better and more stylish each generation. Don't you seem to agree. I used that word on various Cadillacs, on the SL and now on the A4.

Well Maxhonda touched on it, and he's basically right. The ""E"" used to mean gasoline when they put the E after the engine size, like 300E, D was for diesels as in 300D. Now as per the last time they were laid out for me, they meant Compact (C), Executive (E) and Super for (S). Now SL, and SLK, CLK all have more meaning. Coupe, Short, Light, for CLK. Sport Light, is for SL, Coupe Light is for CL. All of this is translated from German words.

I didn't think merc1 would start analyzing this thing to death. Even if every other NM car sold out the fact is this is the most expensive of the models offered thus far and it sold out far faster than any of the other cars. The car will sell and the fact that it's a cadillac may help it because it makes it seem exclusive. Two years ago no one would've believed that cadillac would have a real RWD luxury roadster and people who have been waiting for cadillac to step up will be excited about this car. Like wishnight, I would like to know what you mean when you say the car won't ""beat"" anything else in the class. What are you talking about, this isnt a boxing match. These cars are all competent and luxurious, our point is that the XLR will be among the top two in luxury, performance and innovation. This crap about cadillac's ""rep"" is absurd and you all know that. If MB can charge $90K for the Sl500 then Cadillac can charge $70K for the XLR. Niether car is worth that much and anyone who puts that much money into a car isnt making the wisest investment. The performance, exclusivity and technology of the car sets the price, not the badge on the front. If the Sl500 had the same features as a Miata it wouldnt cost $90K, even if you plastered the MB star all over the car. If the XLR is up to snuff then people who aren't in love with Euro imports will consider the car. Of course people like Maxhonda and merc1 would be caught dead in a cadillac and that's fine, but you cant assume that rational people in the market wouldn't look at and BUY the damn car basedon its merits. If you have a personal preference that is fine but do not try and use (il)logical arguments to justify your position.

also, merc1 don't insult me by acting like I have recently converted to your school of thinking. I have never said that Cadillac's image (image not being synonomous reality) is superior to audi, BMW or MB. I don't know why you are so shocked. I have a thorough understanding of the market and you know that so dont act like I am so pro-cadillac that I would ignore basic truths of the luxury car industry.

There are numerous Audi, BMW and MB models that I would like to own, but the fact remains that I am rooting for the underdog and I hope that one day they can no longer be considered an underdog. If not following the herd makes me a ""cadillacer"" as you have so eloquently called us, than so be it. Now you know much more than the average import fanatic (and you dont like Lexus which is a plus) but let's be honest it isn't hard to go around praising the guys on top.

It's been in the news for more than 2 years. The problem is RWD should have come around a decade ago. It should not have taken this long. I'm excited about the car also, it's the only Cadillac so far that wears the new design theme well, and corvette underpinnings don't hurt either. What sucks is the plastic body panels. GM's choice of skinning should have been aluminum.

""I would like to know what you mean when you say the car won't ""beat"" anything else in the class. What are you talking about, this isnt a boxing match.""

If I remember properly(I'm paying attention), you are the one who started the boxing match. I can reference back to the ""next year Cadillac is going to run past Lexus in sales."" statements made repeatedly. Also, statements along the lines of ""When is Lexus going to compete model to model with Benz & BMW"" thereby, implying Cadillac does compete model to model with anyone.

""This crap about cadillac's ""rep"" is absurd and you all know that.""

Actually, no it isn't. Cadillac has built Crap all thru the 90s. The last time Cadillac's rep was golden was in the 60's(?), it certainly hasn't had a good rep since Mercedes, BMW started exploding with models in the early 90s and since Lexus & Infiniti came on the scene.

""The performance, exclusivity and technology of the car sets the price, not the badge on the front. If the Sl500 had the same features as a Miata it wouldnt cost $90K, even if you plastered the MB star all over the car.""

You have it all wrong here. The badge does set part of the price, otherwise a SL500 wouldn't cost $90,000. The badge on the front of a S600 also allows Mercedes to sell it and sell it for a premium. If you stuck a Cadillac badge on a S600, and tried to sell it for even $10K less, very few would buy it. The point is, Badge does set price, partially.

Of course the SL500 with Miata features wouldn't cost $90K, because then it wouldn't be a SL500. The features of the SL500, as well as the ownership experience, the reputation of Mercedes, the build quality, and the Prestige factor is what makes it cost $90K.

""Of course people like Maxhonda and merc1 would be caught dead in a cadillac""

The proper word would be ""wouldn't"" not ""would"".

Actually, I would love to be behind the wheel of a XLR, if it does compete with cars like the SC430, SL500, XK8. The art & science theme works on the XLR, unlike the CTS which is a big positive. If it drives luxuriously, handles well, has outstanding build quality(Something that has eluded Cadillac), and competes, I would take a XLR over a SC430. Of course at the price Cadillac is hoping to charge for the car, it better be a much better car than the SC430 for example.

""Any 8th grader who was chauferred to school is his mom's RX300 can come on here and repeat a lot of the ""lexus rules!"" or ""cadillac sucks!"" nonsense I see on Townhall.""

I understand that most people don't think that Mercury will be around much longer and that Lincoln really doesn't compete. However, they have to make up the appearance right?

Well call me what you want, but when GM has already had more than 20,000 inquiries into this vehicle of people wishing to place deposits, it doesn't seem too far-fetched for a mere 3,000 vehicles to sell out in one day. That's less than 1/6 the inquiry number, anyway. And even with a computed atricion (sp?) rate, 3,000 should be easy to achieve.

Who knows how the price was/will be set.

I will say this again, you have to consider what a car offers when you look at the price. Just because the XLR is a cadillac doesn't mean it costs too much. If the car cost too little everyone would criticize it for being too cheap to be equal to the SL or XKR. If it costs 70K then it is considered too expensive to be a cadillac. I want to know what price would be appropriate for this car? I dont understand how Cadillac isnt allowed to charge $70K for a car when they have cars going up to $60K right now. This is not acura, VW or infiniti we are talking about. They know that to be seen as competitive they have to offer models that are in the same bracket as top MB and BMW models and that is what they are doing. There is no reason for this car to be cheaper if MB and Jaguar are going to charge 90K and 80K, respectively, for their two doors. I really wish the SC430 would drop out of this discussion. I dont think anyone really considers that car to be on the same level as the expensive euro convetibles. It's performance, handling and technology are all lacking compared to the Sl500 and even the revised XK8. You guys have to realize that almost everything GM comes out with (and this really applies to cadillacs) is predicted to fail or is met with skepticism. The first Escalade was predicted to be a failure,the '02 escalade was faintly praised but still called nothing more than a Tahoe with a caddy badge, the EXT was criticized, the CTS was supposed to be a slow seller because of its styling, the H2 was called a waste of time and now the XLR is being doubted. If we use previous models as an example I think we see that the doubts are always there but the sales follow anyway.

If people were trying to put down deposits on the Cien (which wasnt even approed for production) at the auto show last year why wouldn't there be a demand for the Xlr once it arrives?

merc1,

please define the ""ownership experience"" that makes the Sl500 worth $90K. That is a joke. Putting up with arrogant dealers and making too many trips to the service department counts as a great ownership experience?? Spare me.

honda99,

If badge sets price why are lexus vehicles so much cheaper, model-to-model, than BMW and MB vehicles? I have already established that most caddy models are more expensive than Lexus models. We both know that Lexus has a better rep than cadillac but I want to know why they cant price their models like BMW and MB if their image is supposedly just as prestigous. Also, why would the XLR have to a ""much better"" car than the Sc430 if its going to cost the same or slightly more? The XLR will be faster, it looks much better and it has far more technology than the SC430 so it sure as hell should cost more."

1833,"November 4, 2002 6:31PM",maxhonda99,"1487, As always, your posts always have issues.

""I will say this again, you have to consider what a car offers when you look at the price.""

What you say or think doesn't really matter in the marketplace, now does it? I will say this again also, car pricing is based on MORE than just what it has physically. Car prices also include what people are willing to pay for intangibles. In the case of a Mercedes, people pay thousand of dollars for the 3-pointed star. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't pay more for a car with the 3-pointed star, I really do think people who pay thousands more for the prestige factor of a Mercedes are insane, but I don't set the market price neither do you. The marketplace as a whole sets the price and that basically means a car will cost more just because it has a 3-pointed star on the hood. And frankly let's face it, a Cadillac is no Mercedes. Therefore, even if the XLR had the same equipment, the same performance, the same build quality, the price in the marketplace would be lower for the XLR because it lacks 1 thing: The 3-pointed star(Prestige & heritage).

""I dont understand how Cadillac isnt allowed to charge $70K for a car when they have cars going up to $60K right now.""

Let's get realistic. On paper Cadillac has cars that cost near $60K. Again I'll go through this, the price is really much less because of a few reasons: 1) Cadillac's are discounted deeply. 2)GM is always throwing out incentives to sell cars. This is in either of 3 ways, one is thru subvented leasing, two is thru factory or dealer rebates and three is thru subsidized financing(0%). 3) Cadillac sells very few cars fully loaded. Cadillac charging $60K for cars is like stating the LS430 goes for $70K or the S-class goes for $100K. Why is this thinking false? It is false because we all know the average LS430 costs nowhere near $70K MSRP. The Majority of LS430s sold are somewhere in the low $60K range. Same with the S-class, the most popular S-class is the S430, which doesn't cost $100K. And therefore, saying the Cadillac's cost $60K us just a wee bit(actually much more)misleading.

""They know that to be seen as competitive they have to offer models that are in the same bracket as top MB and BMW models and that is what they are doing.""

I remember proving this statement wrong previously also. Where is Cadillac offering models in the same brackets as MB & BMW?
As of know, Cadillac has no competition for the ML320 or X5. Don't forget the SRX isn't out yet.
Cadillac has nothing that competes with the SLK, Z4 at the lower end of the roadster spectrum. Cadillac has no coupe or station wagon version of the CTS. Cadillac has nothing to compete with the 5-series or E-class. Cadillac has nothing to compete with the 745i or S430, and Cadillac has nothing at the high end of the spectrum such as a Z8, SL55, S600. Where is the model for model competition?

""I really wish the SC430 would drop out of this discussion. I dont think anyone really considers that car to be on the same level as the expensive euro convetibles.""

If really nobody considers the SC430 to be a competitor with the euro convertibles, let me tell you, nobody is going to even consider a $70K Cadillac convertible against anything European or Japanese.

""The first Escalade was predicted to be a failure,the '02 escalade was faintly praised but still called nothing more than a Tahoe with a caddy badge, the EXT was criticized""

The first escalade wasn't predicted to be a sales failure, it just predicted that it would be a POS, which it was. After all, it wasn't a Cadillac in any sense of the word. It was merely a chromed up Denali. I don't ever remember the '02 Escalade being called a failure. In fact ever since it has come out, it's been pretty well regarded. The EXT is merely a Avalance. That's reason enough for it to be criticized.

""the CTS was supposed to be a slow seller because of its styling"" Who said anything about slow seller? I just said it was ugly and it can't hold a candle to cars such as the G35, IS300, 330i or C320.

""If badge sets price why are lexus vehicles so much cheaper, model-to-model, than BMW and MB vehicles?"" Refer back to the beginning of the post about prestige. Lexus doesn't have the prestige of a Mercedes, Lexus has only been around 12 years.

""I have already established that most caddy models are more expensive than Lexus models.""

Key word ""I"". The only thing you have established is that YOU think they are more expensive. But really quite the contrary.

RX300s cost about $40K
ES300s cost about $35-$40K
GS300/430s cost about $45K-$55K
LS430s cost about $55K to $70K
IS300s cost about $35K
LX470s cost about $65K
SC430 cost about $62K i think

CTS runs about $35K
Seville about $48K to $55K
Deville about the same.

Let's not forget what I went over earlier in this post: Cadillacs are heavily discounted and they have heavy incentives. Let's not forget how skewed the Deville sales figures are because of fleet sales. You have established something that only you yourself believe.

""Also, why would the XLR have to a ""much better"" car than the Sc430 if its going to cost the same or slightly more? The XLR will be faster, it looks much better and it has far more technology than the SC430 so it sure as hell should cost more.""

One answer can explain it all: Prestige. Lexus has it over Cadillac, by a long shot. Really? how much faster is it going to be? by a few-tenths of a second, and that's not much. More technology? I haven't seen much on it's soo superior technology. Is it going to have the build quality of a Lexus or the reliability? I doubt that."
1834,"November 4, 2002 6:31PM",ljflx,"Why doesn't Lexus price their cars as high as BMW and MB?

Because it costs them much less to produce them. They have better automation, less manpower per auto and cheaper labor costs. Though they have joined the club at the top the company still acts like they haven't which is just fine with me. They are also cohesively integrated with Toyota in spreading the technology around. How else do you explain a Camry having a better navigation system than Mercedes.

SC430 - say whatever you want about the car but it is spectacular by my standards. Lexus doesn't care about the enthusiasts - it cares about its target market."

Just as it is statistically probable, and fairly much dictated by the law of conservation of energy and quatum mechanics, that as I clap my hands right now, someone in some place in this universe or otherwise is ""unclapping"" their hands.

Moreover, the greater point was that, ultimately, the XLRs price will be determined by what is a ""best-fit"" for production, price, profit, productivity, efficiency, labor, parts, etc., etc. There's an infinitesimal ammount of variables, but nonetheless, linear programming or some other form of computer modeling handles the job well..."
1836,"November 4, 2002 9:36PM",magnetophone,"Most of your post, baron, could have been summed up in 2 sentences. The law of conservation of energy is misapplied in this case.

It doesn't matter if it's statistically possible, what matter is what actually happens. Here's an example: The Audi A4 Cabriolet has already sold out for the year worldwide. So you could technically say, in the few weeks it's been 'out' that it has sold 30,000 units. But that's a misleading number - people have known about the car for many months and have placed deposits and have anticipation.

The real judge of success is not Neiman's or whether it can sell 3,000 orders. I think the real judge of success is whether the XLR sells consistently for decades, raises the standard by which all other cars in its category are judged, and commands a premium, like the SL has. People obviously feel the car is worth $100,000 - doesn't mean it's worth that to you or me, but it's worth that to more people than for any other giant luxo convertible out there."
1837,"November 4, 2002 11:29PM",merc1,"You've somehow let the others confuse you. Where did I use ""ownership experience"" in any of MY posts? Though since you bring up the concept, why don't you take a look at the SL500 board and see what the owners have to say. Are you saying that every SL has to go back to the dealer and that all MB dealers are arrogant? If that is the case all of Cadillac's cars are junk. Period. Now do you want to get oriented or continue down the path of vast incorrectness?

Secondly, I'm not sure why you can't understand that NOBODY is paying 60K for a Cadillac. Do you even read the Cadillac boards here? Cadillacs sell with huge discounts. Now before you say it I know the XLR isn't going to be discounted like the Deville, but if you think the market is already primed for a 75K Cadillac based on the sales prices of their current cars you're wrong at best, and simply ingnoring reality at worst. Mercedes, depending on the model either go for a few thousand off sticker: any left over 2002 (S and CL models especially), and the 2003 C and E class cars...or they go for sticker: 2003 SL and CL. Even if I'm not covering every single MB market in the country you can bet nobody is getting 5-7K off a new 2003 Benz, like you can readily get off of that new DTS. I know you know this.

We do agree on the SC430 I see, though I honestly still want to ""like"" the car. It's hard for me to dismiss a GT car, even one made by Lexus. It's priced right and truthfully has very little competition at it's price point and Lexus knew this. Very smart.

However I think you have my position wrong on the XLR. I would very much like the car to be a hit. I just don't want to see the car flop simply because it was overpriced. The XLR should be no more than 65-70K with every available option, that way it sits in between the SL and the SC and more or less eye-level with the Jaguar. I think a starting price of 75K and possibly over 80K with options is too much...the attitude will be ""may as well get the Benz or XKR"". That will ensure failure for the XLR. Price the car right intially and raise it if demand is high...thats what everyone else does (lol). Nobody is saying there won't be ANY demand for the XLR. How much demand is the question. Simply put, if Cadillac doesn't bite off more than it can chew by overpricing the XLR it will be a hit.

I'm not sure who said the Hummer H2 was a waste of time. I personally think it's a great vehicle. Having seen just about every TV program, reading every article (including the one in CAR magazine, usually very harsh on American products) and lastly having gone to see it in the metal I think it's the best engineered vehicle GM has done in years. The thing is purpose built, every GM engineering unit should be as motivated.

My only problem with the Cadillac trucks is that there is no where enough seperation from the Chevys they are based on. I mean honestly what did Cadillac do other than add some leather, wood, crests, and a few other small options to make a Denali worth 60K? A new and totally sperate interior would go a long way towards justifying the price difference.

Why can't Lexus price their vehicles like MB and BMW? Easy, Lexus has three maing things going for them Price/Reliablity/Quality. Take away one of those by pricing the LS430 or SC430 the same as their MB/BMW competition and they'd sell a lot less....a whole lot less. The Japanese as a whole make the highest quality cars in the world, and they have gained the right in the market to price their cars higher than Americans or Koreans, but when it comes to German cars they still have to play the price card. Ask Acura about NSX sales when a 911 can be had for less.

Lastly, you say that everything GM does is met with skepticism. Its not hard to see why. The CTS is a prime example. While it's head and shoulders above the Catera, we still have to wait until next year for the proper interior and base engine. And you can't say it's just me and GM bashers, Lutz himself has said that car isn't up to snuff. GM simply has a history of putting out half-baked cars, so naturally the press and foreign car enthusiasts are ""skeptical"". This isn't as big a problem with ""regular"" cars, but when it comes to Luxury cars, reputation is everything. Cadillac is going to have to do a string of cars ""right"" before their image turns around. Audi did it with one hit after another, 1996 A4, 1997 A8, 1998 A6, and back again with the 2002 A4. None of Audi's cars were ""works in progress"" upon their release like the CTS is. GM simply has to stop it.

No, it's really not hart to cater to both the enthusiast market and the target market. And I would hardly call the IS300 a failure. Sure, the IS300 hasn't sold as well as Lexus expected in the states, but elsewhere in the world the IS-series is selling well.

Audi probably does both the best, if you discount Mercedes having AMG. Wishnhigh1, what you think?

I've seen at least one of every luxury brand's cars with a cloth top or some other silly add-on, but the difference between Lexus/MB and Cadillac is that Cadillac dealers still stock these cars on their lots. The Caddy dealer here (Town and Country Cadillac of Naperville) regularly has DeVilles done up in this way. You'd practially have to tell an MB dealer that you're not going to buy the car in order to get them to do such a thing to a Benz.

Cadillacs interiors are really not as nice as they should be for the price of the car. Since I live about a 1000 mile round trip from the nearest BMW/Mercedes/Lexus dealership I am really not able to go into one of those dealerships to compare cars. But it is my considered opinion that GM's interiors have gone downhill in the last 20 years.

Cadillac should not take anything slow. They need to attack things full speed ahead. They have been behind for so long that it would make no sense to have a ten year plan, they need a two year plan. Cadillac is not excactly Hyundai, their image isnt as bad as you people want to make it out to be. You guys need to apply some brainpower when reading my posts. I NEVER said their cars sell for $60K but I did say that they have models that go up to that price range. Incentives aside there are ways to option a cadillac up to the $60K range. They are not VW who is making a $30K price jump in one or two years. they dont have any $70K cars in their lineup because they dont have anything worth $70K to sell right now, that will change next year. The other thing is I want to know how merc1 and hond99 seem to have such a good handle on the car's price. I have not seen any official info about the price but everyone here is throwing around the $75K and $80 numbers like its fact. Next week you will say the car will cost $85K. The car might be $70K fully loaded, we don't even know that yet so stop harping on the fact that it's overpriced. This insanity about cadillac building up its image over 10 years and gradually building better cars is crap and it would be a recipe for mediocrity. They know certain people will never buy a cadillac and those are the people who are on here constantly beating up on the Cimarron and cadillacs that arent even out yet. However, before its too late they need to get busy attracting unbiased or innovative buyers who have a mind of their own.

The CTS is not perfect but it is not nearly the dog you guys are making it to be. It's underpowered? compared to the IS300, ES300 or the C320? Please spare me. It's interior may need some work but so does the interior of the C320, IS300, 330i, 9-5 and most of all the damn G35. Audi may make the best interiors but once you get beyond that the CTS is right on par with the competition. The only two entry lux cars interiors I really like are the A4 and the ES300, everything else needs work. Of course the mags and you people have nothing negative to say about anything that' not a caddy. Anyone who says the car isn't competitive with those other cars is not being realistic. Even if the cars styling isnt your cup of tea the car is still a good performer BEFORE it gets the new engine.

All it appears to be doing is launching models that mimic the concepts of other existing leaders (XLR is intended to be in the vein of the SL, the SRX is going after the car-based crossover crowd - the RX300's, the X5's, etc.) This doesn't constitute anything but trying to catch up to the competition. This is not a bad thing... in fact it's necessary for Cadillac's survival, but (someone with a neutral opinion) show me that they're anything other than just a boxier American version of BMW and Mercedes standards? At least with Audi you can say they're going their own way - their cars are FWD and AWD and their goals are different (for example, the A4 is obviously more focused on safety and quality than a 330i - compare the paint jobs or interiors and you'll probably agree.)

BMW, Audi, and Lexus have their ""schtick"" - BMW is aspirational performance, Audi is sort of a minimalist safe & secure, with a heavy focus on ""apparent"" quality, whereas Lexus is focused on rock-solid reliability.

One thing you are is consistent. You always turn around and tell us what you ""didn't"" say right after you've been proven wrong. What was the point of pointing out that Cadillacs can cost up to 60K if they aren't selling anywhere near those prices? Does it really make a difference if the XLR costs 75K or 80K, it's still going to be a tough sell for a Cadillac at either price.

Nobody said the CTS is a ""dog"". But your view on the CTS doesn't even jive with Bob Lutz's and he runs the company! The car in it's 2003 form is underdeveloped. Period. Is the CTS competitive, yes. Is it among the top cars in the class, NO. Same ole GM story ""wait till next year"". You have to be ""innovative"" to buy a Cadillac? What on earth does that mean?

That very attitude ""full speed ahead"" is why the CTS isn't complete now. Just think if they had waited one more year and introduced a finished car. Reputation is everything in the luxury car business and the CTS has been forever tarnished in the minds of many because of the 2003 version.

Infiniti is still struggling with that very same question. The Q45, while and interesting car has flopped again. They tried to market it as a sports sedan and it's anything but. Then they bring in the M45 with %95 of everything the Q45 has. Oh and they made it unattractive too. The I35 is just a fancy Maxima and the G35 is hindered by a silly interior. But man is it a fun car!

Acura, I guess has decided not to truly step up with a true ""luxury"" car, as their next product is yet another 20-30K front-driver. Where is the V8 rwd RL replacement? I just know for 2004 they aren't going to disappoint me again. They're gonna do the right thing right?

This is your opinion, not fact. Considering the amount of positive press the car is getting and the number of people who have contacted cadillac about the car, I don't know that you are correct in the assumption that the car will be overpriced. Once again I state, this is not VW, this is cadillac. They are not going from entry level cars to super-lux cars. Theya re going from semi-expensive vehicles to very expensive vehicles. They are also planning V12 powered models that will cost more than the XLR.

""Reputation is everything in the luxury car business and the CTS has been forever tarnished in the minds of many because of the 2003 version""

Spare us the dramatics. The car was projected to sell 40K units this year and that's what it will sell. I would say the majority of cars come out with a serious flaw that is addressed within the first three model years. That can be interior design,transimission availability engine power, styling or even price. The CTS is no different. Why do you act like Cadillac is the only manufacturer that has ever put out a less than perfect product. If BMW had just waited another year to perfect idrive maybe it wouldn't have been so senselessly confusing and overwhelming. If audi had waited about three years to release the A6 maybe it wouldnt have labored with a weak 200hp iron block V6 that propelled it to 60 in about 9secs. No matter how good or bad the CTS was it wasnt going to be univerally loved. If it looked like a BMW they would have been slammed for not being original, they design a unique car and its slammed for not being mainstream. They come out with a manual tranny and people question Caddy's intelligence because they say no one who buys caddys drives a stick. They can't win. I want to know which cars in the class are complete. To me the A4 and maybe the 330 are the closest to complete. I can find major flaws in the Xtype, Is300, LS, G35 and C320. I can list them if you wish. In fact considering its price I would take a '03 9-3 with the sport package over some of the aforementioned models. It looks good in and out and it should deliver better performance than any of those cars except the 330 and G35.

that is the cleaned up version of my post. I dont understand why everything is so strict now. I am not ""attacking"" anyone on here and I dont take offense to anything said to me. I have not changed the way I post and I dont see why I am getting reprimanded all of a sudden."

No, because we weren't talking about the other cars here, just Cadillac. Why is that so hard to understand? This was about Cadillac, not the rest. Plus no other car other than the IS300 has to have their interior redone in just one model year.

I said that Cadillac will have trouble selling a car for 80K. Yes that is my opinion and everyone else's in the car industry. Why is that you brought up how many cars Cadillac sells and what prices they sell them at? For one Cadillac hasn't done anything in the last 30+ years that warrant them selling anything near 80K. Nothing. Why is it that GM fans are the ones that can't grasp the concept of lineage and reputation? DeVilles are discounted heavily as are Sevilles. Cadillac hasn't groomed anyone for a 80K car, so yes that price for a Cadillac will be a shock for many. The same price shock that you're trying to imply that VW will have Cadillac will also have.

"" Once again I state, this is not VW, this is cadillac. They are not going from entry level cars to super-lux cars. Theya re going from semi-expensive vehicles to very expensive vehicles. They are also planning V12 powered models that will cost more than the XLR.""

For once you're correct, Cadillac isn't VW. The difference there is VW makes at least ONE car that is at the top of their respective class. Cadillac doesn't have one car that is anywhere near the top of any class. VW is doing what Lexus did in 1990, but with the same brand. Cadillac is reaching for new heights and hasn't truly made a mark on their present market.

About the CTS. Why is it that only Cadillac introduces a car for one year and then promises that next years will be better. Why not the best car possible at launch? If you can't see that some buyers are turned off by that then you don't understand the luxury market. You mention the Audi A6. That car made it on styling and quality of build alone and it's available with other engines. Nor was the original A6 2.8 billed as a sports sedan in the same way the CTS is.

Please list all the major flaws for those luxury cars that caused their makers to install a totally new base engine and redo their interiors in just ONE model year. Those things having to be done to the CTS scream half-baked, unfinished product. Period.

I know the new 7 was 'designed' by der vunderartiste, but frankly it's a hodgepodge.

1932,"November 29, 2002 7:33AM",ghloeb,"Well, I bought it -- and it's fabulous.

After two months of wavering while my 1998 740i lease ticked to the end, I started the process of buying the 740 from BMW (the lease was up) because of my misgivings about the 745. This thread was a huge source of info on that.

Then I learned that BMW had sweet financing terms on the 2002s to move them out, and I figured I'd be spending nearly as much on the non-warrantied '98 740 as on the new 745. So I made the decision to get the 745 -- without ever having driven it. Can't really explain why.

My conclusions so far:

** The iDrive complexity issue is vastly overstated. It took very little time to get familiar with the base functions. The system's logic is fairly transparent, so I did not even consult the owner's manual on the iDrive until I wanted to do some more advanced tasks, like programming in voice commands for the built-in telephone. The ""this car makes me feel like an idiot"" folks should buy Cadillacs and shut up.

** The 745 is about 30% more fun to drive than the 740, which was already a near-perfect driving experience. The extra power in the engine is evident, making it just a tick smoother in highway driving. The sensation is slightly up-higher and more knife-like, more like the 5-series, instead of the lower sedan-like 740 feel.

** Once you drive it, the ""looks"" issue becomes less of a problem for those, like me, who consider the 740 a classic. The 740 is still the better looking car, but the feel of the 745 is in synch with the body changes, the rearward location of the cabin, the accent on the wheels, the more rounded corners. (It's cute that the video BMW gives you with the car includes a Chris Bangle segment explaining that the raised trunk design is tied to the roof aerodynamics -- they clearly are defensive on this point.)

** There are a couple of really silly quirks that are beyond explanation. Why would any engineer design a headrest to automatically rise when the seat is adjusted?

** Of course, if the car ends up spending 2 weeks in the shop because of software snafus, I'll have a completely different view. But I've heard the mantra ""those problems have been fixed and all the campaigns have been performed on the late-build vehicles"" enough to believe it, for now."
1933,"November 29, 2002 12:32PM",pearl85,I am trying to decide between the two. I currently have a bmw 540ia. I love it so I guess I am leaning toward the 745 but I need reliability also. I would appreciate any and all ideas.

1935,"December 2, 2002 5:21AM",trentpa,"Apples and oranges. Both cars are terrific vehicles. For me, it would come down to what is more important to you: handling or comfort. The 745 is more of a driver's car: providing sharp turning and awesome power. The LS430 provides less excitement in driving, but awesome comfort and quiet. Drive them both and determine which one provides you with the best driving experience, given the type of driving that you do. A few other things to consider would be price (745 is generally $15-20,000 higher than the LS430) and reliability (Lexus seems to be more reliable, based on everything I've read). For me, it was a no-brainer: although my heart pumps harder when I drive a 745 (I test-drove one and my best friend has one), I opted for the comfort and incredibly smooth ride of the LS430 (this weekend, when I slowed from 105 mph to 90 mph on the interstate, my wife asked whether there was a reason I was driving so slowly - - she thought I had slowed from about 70 to 55)."

1941,"December 6, 2002 12:53PM",tasillo,"Can't agree more with PathDoc. The huge center console that houses i-drive and cupholders would be better served with a tiptronic style shifter for the 6-speed automatic with the redundant controls on the steering wheel. My current 2000 740iL has what I feel is the perfect cockpit. Spacious, yet intimate. Driver oriented, but luxurious. I would probably appreciate the i-drive as my car with the integrated phone, GPS system and upgraded sound with DSP processor is about impossible to figure out anyway!

My only other suggestion to BMW would be to go out on a limb and provide warranty and maintenance protection beyond the 50k currently offered. You see more BMW's with lots of miles for a reason, they beg to be driven! How much additional cost would it add to the vehicle to make the statement, bumper to bumper warranty and maintenance for 7 years or 100k.

Funny, my wife's Mitsu runs regular and has had no engine problems while I, running Amoco white, had engine failure at 6 years, 6 months and 74k miles. I, being one of the lucky(?) owners of one of these will probably never own another BMW - at least not one out of warranty. I took my car to the dealer for all maintenance and they never alerted me to this potentially devastating problem. The car ended up running like an ill tuned model T and I traded for 5K under wholesale 'poor' condition even though the car looked and drove perfectly(except for an idle that would wake the dead and 0 to 60 in 5 minutes).

1944,"December 18, 2002 9:56AM",l943973,"Just read in interesting article in AutoWeek about the 745i. It turns out that the other cars that owners looked at were the

Mercedes Benz S55
Audi S8
Infiniti Q45

All happen to be high powered (310+ hp) autos.

So it would seem that even though there isn't much talk about the Q45, there are folks out there still checking out the car. The LS430 and S500 weren't on their lists.

Which brings up another fact I came across on the BMW website. It turns out when you select the competitors to the 745, it only lists

Audi A8,
Jaguar XJ Series
Lexus LS430

In this case, they left out the Mercedes Benz S-Class. From a price point, I guess it makes sense since the 745 is cheaper than the S500.

Looking at Carpoint, it looks like the income demographics for an S-Class ($185k) is much higher than the BMW 7-Series ($175k, no longer listed) and the LS ($145k). So even if the LS is trying to compete with the 7 Series and S-Class, the buyers are a lot different they maybe what marketing is expecting. The Q45 trails at around ($100k) even though marketing is trying to cater to an income demographic of $200k (Edmunds src).

So in the end, if you want status, get the Mercedes or MB/MayBach. Actually if you afford the Maybach, then the S500 is probably too cheap for you."

The car brings all types of engine and suspension technology to the table, but for the life of me I can't bare to look at the rear of the car. The front has become less severe with time, but that rear end is only palatable in black or dark blue. Strangely enough though, the car also makes a statement in white, I mean it's get the looks and fingers pointing....though I'm not sure all are saying it's a ""good"" looking car.

The 2004 BMW 5-Series is where the straw will be broken. So far it looks even worse!

The S-Class has always been on another level as far as it's average buyer;s demographic is concerned. One basic reason for that is the price, it starts where all the rest top out (except the 760Li). The S55 has moved further upmarket with 493hp and 107K sticker. I've driven the S500 and thought it was good enough, I can't image how a 191 hp increase must feel!

The Q45 is a very interesting car. Infiniti messed up on the marketing of it though. It was never as sporty as a 7-Series or an S55, and for all it's 340hp it's no faster than similar cars with less power. No large car marketed as a sports sedan has been a success, except for the 7-Series. Even the 7-Series has started to place more emphasis on luxury with each re-do. Infiniti should have marketed the Q45 as a luxury car first, with a touch of sport. Why can't Infiniti get their transmissions right? The M45 is a midsize car with 340hp and it's actually slower than the way less powerful E500, GS430, and 540i.

All is not lost at Infiniti. They are doing great on the lower end. The G35 is a hit, and rightly so. I'm forced to drive this G35 Coupe the first chance I get. The FX35 and FX45 look to be potential winners also. Infiniti, like Acura just can't get any respect past 40K.

The RL needs a V8, but Honda says that isn't going to happen. There really isn't anything ""wrong"" with the RL, its just being a ""good"" or ""decent"" car doesn't cut it against the E320, 530i, GS300, and A6 2.7t. Not to mention the V8 versions of those cars. The only reason it sells at all is because you can easily get 5-7K off it's sticker. The CL (boy I had hopes for this car) doesn't even look as good as the TL sedan, how bass-ackwards is that. They may drop it, but that too would be a mistake with all the 2-doors coming...it would be another segment they ""gave up"" on. I can't say it enough, bring back the ""Legend"" name and make the car worthy of the title and Acura would be back in style again.

The NSX was a stunning piece of work compared to the 1991 Ferrari 348 and 993 series Porsche 911, but times have changed. Ferrari stomped a mutthole in NSX with the F355 and they sealed the coffin with the 360, and Porsche did a complete re-do of the 911. The Acura is basically a 12 year old car with the a price thats totally unrealistic.

1957,"December 20, 2002 6:37AM",footie,"Thanks, Merc1. Here's what I think...we each have our opinions...

Let's see, both the 2001 E and RL came out in 1996 and were pretty sharp styling changes from prior models (thought the RL seemed more of an evolution from the Legend than the 96 E from its predecessors). The RL and the E were signs of the times, not unique styling icons. No copying here.

The feature list for the two is remarkably the same. Probably the biggest difference is what's standard on the Acura and optional on the E. The option list for MB goes on and on - and the already high price, goes higher still.

This is how they differed on major items: MB had one extra transmission speed, head curtains. Acura had Moonroof, Xenons, Bose, CD player, bigger engine.

Performance dynamics were similar, both had ABS, ASC, Traction, good handling and braking.

Mercedes listed about $9,000 more and went up from there. Acura came with everything but NAV, another $2K.

As has been true for about a 10 years, Mercedes had far worse reliability, dependability and durability record, and much higher cost of ownership.

MB is like a Rolex. World-class jewelry, so-so watch. Comes in lots of different styles and glitter. Looks belie its constant need for service and erratic timekeeping.

Acura is like a Seiko. Nice jewelry, world class watch. Comes in one major style, low on glitter but still black tie. Owners find out that they are the luxury car deal of the decade and keep them forever.

Enjoy the different choices we have!

Their dynamics were not similar, the Benz handled better, no contest there. Yes, I've driven both. Car and Driver and Road and Track have compared the two and they agree with me.

I'll give you that the RL (being a Honda) has a better reliability record, but durability I would have object there. A Benz will still have better paint, body and interior quality longer than a Honda will once the years/miles really add up. I don't think the car would have outsold every other car in it's class if it was such this unreliable beast.

And for the record Xenons didn'tshow up on the RL until 1999, they were an option on the E-Class in 1998. Some of the other things you listed like a moonroof, overhead console are really, really minor and were also available on the E-Class. Mercedes tends to put the important things first, technology, safety etc....then add the trivial stuff, a ""overhead console"" come one, thats a weak defense.

In short the E-Class was the better car, the market has proven which one was preferred. The RL didn't compare, even by your own post.

1959,"December 20, 2002 7:36AM",nealm1,"On this one, I agree (God help me) with merc1. The RL may make more sense for a lot of people given the price differential, and one could forcefully -- maybe even compellingly -- argue that the law of diminishing returns sets in with a vengence once one gets above the RL's sticker, but you can't really say that the RL is actually competitive w/the E in a price-blind comparison. Which makes the LS/S/E comparisons all the more amazing. The E (IMHO) can't compare with the LS (isn't supposed to) and the LS, at a minimum, is competitive with the S, even though there is a huge price differential."
1960,"December 20, 2002 4:22PM",footie,"Well, I guess there's just a difference in priorities that constitutes value. And of course, individual experiences vary.

Performance didn't seem very different to me and I've driven both, my sister's and a friend's E320. They feel a little different in the driver's seat, but both felt very stable, surefooted, in every driving situation I had them in.

I also don't look at Mercedes as a technology leader anymore. I would be scared to death to rely on any drive by wire, brake by wire system in a Benz. They have a very spotty record with electricals and have generally been behind in electronics and microprocessors technology. That's why the new SL500 comes with a complete back-up mechanical brake system.

Leadership in electrical technology is in the U.S. and Japan.

Take common technology, like an in-dash CD, 6 CD changer that has been in Toyota/Lexus, Honda/Acura for some time. It's been in the trunk of Benz's forever and has finally made it to the dash this year ( 1 CD )

Production technology leadership is in Japan followed by the U.S. Germany is a distant third and not catching up. The best automobile factories quality-wise are in Japan, next are Japanese owned factories in the U.S., the Japan-US co-owned factories in the U.S.

The Japanese production systems, transplanted here, just work better and are car line independent. The Germans haven't figured this out yet and can't get their head around the fact that you can build almost ANY car at a very low defect level. The Toyota Corolla is the best high volume production car line every produced.

Durability of paint? The original paint on my sister's 1995 Legend is still gorgeous. And so is the leather interior. It spent 6 years in Georgia and now two in New York.

The only Acura interior I saw that was suffering was in my mother-in-law's 1990 Legend Coupe. She gave it to her grandson last year when she bought her Lexus.

It had 260K on it and after spending 10 years baking on the tarmac during work hours at an Air Force base in San Antonio, it had developed some cracks on the dash and the top of the back seats had to be replaced.

However, the original engine and transmission were still singing. I do remember that it got a set of motor mounts back in the nineties, so it wasn't perfect.

That's durable to me, and I wouldn't have expected a MB interior to have done any better or worse - they are good. The mechancials -- I don't think that the MB would have gotten that far without significant service and expenses.

To top that, the 1990 Acura Legend cost 1/2 of the 1990 E Mercedes.

On the E and LS 430 - no opinions here at all, either :==)

The E doesn't compare with the LS430. Surprisingly, neither does the S. The LS430 is simply the best car that money can buy, not the S. The S quality was 'POOR' for the first year reported in CR. The LS is not the fastest, but its quicker than many cars it's size, not the best handling but remarkably agile, or even the best style - it looks like the S Class successor that never happened.

But it is the most reliable, dependable, available and therefore durable car ever made. It has an incredible array of technologies, all of which work from the get go. The 1990 ones are still working just fine thank you. It does insulate you more than some people like in their driving experience, but it does deliver you where you want to go, as safely as possible, every time, all the time.

To me that's value. MB (BMW and Audi) have to radically change the way they make cars, and therefore design and source them, to be competitive in this day and age. Until they do, it's a Rolex vs. Seiko comparison. One is jewelry, one is a timepiece."
1961,"December 20, 2002 8:00PM",ljflx,"Why is it that the Japanese can make such high quality reliable cars - whether in the US or Japan - that just put everyone else to shame? It's not just Toyota but Honda and Nissan as well on every model they make. Any one of the three can be the leader in any given year. If this were a betting room no one would bet against Japanese car makers being the reliability leader for the next 5+ years. So what gives. Why do they build such near perfect cars regardless of what country they are built in. The Americans have improved but are still way behind and the Germans are going south pretty fast.

Footie - I'm with you on most of the issues. Technology development that is not reliable will prove to be a house of cards. When you have to read a book to change a radio station or leave instructions for a valet to start the car you have gone over the top and made complexity out of simplicity. It's worse still when it doesn't work (have you read the 7 series board lately) That is not staying ahead of the curve. That is dumb. I also have no faith in MB's drive by wire. The should fix their existing reliability problems before moving ahead with new technologies. If they did I might look at an S-class a year from now when my lease is up. But in all honesty I can't even think of walking away from the perfection of the LS430."
1962,"December 20, 2002 11:07PM",merc1,"If Mercedes isn't THE technology leader, then they certainly are among the top 2. The other being BMW.

Electronics, such as CD changers are hardly ""technology"" as most people understand the word. It's the brand culture that keeps/kept Mercedes/Porsche and other German makes from installing these things, not that they couldn't. I know you realize that. Lexus doesn't make it's own stereos, neither does Acura. In short if Mercedes felt that these things were so important they would have done it years ago. You have to remember these are German companies and they're still a little stubborn. European companies have never place emphasis on things like stereos, cupholders etc, and it hasn't hurt them nearly as some would like you to believe.

Technology is electro-hydraulic brakes, active suspension, radar-based cruise control, folding hardtops, all of which Mercedes did first, all of which Acura doesn't even offer. Acura only compares to Mercedes in two areas, quality and reliabilty. Other than that Mercedes wipes out Acura with the first turn of the key.

""That's why the new SL500 comes with a complete back-up mechanical brake system.""

Do you think BMW, Lexus or any other company that will introduce this technolgy (BMW is next) won't have a backup system in place? It would be foolish and totally un-Mercedes for Mercedes not too. Electronics are not perfect in any car, including the Japanese ones. Yes they are better at it, but they too have problems....admittedly not as often. About Mercedes' SBC I haven't heard about it failing on the SL or the E-Class as of yet. The ABC active suspension technology works brilliantly too, as advertised.

I see you're going off into the best factories and the best this and that. Well, our initial conversation was about which cars have the most advanced technology. That would be Mercedes-Benz or BMW. Specifically, the SL, CL or 7-Series. Period. For better of for worse they are miles ahead of anything produced in Japan. America has nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing worth mentioning.

A 1995 Legend was a good car, no doubt, but I can find plenty of cars from just about any brand in good shape that spent most of their life in Georgia. Now lets talk about all the E-Classes I see around here (Chicago) that look brand new. Now just the 1996-2002 models either, I'm talking about the 1986-1995 E also. Ever noticed which cars don't have damage after a hail storm? It's usually Volvo and Mercedes, thicker sheetmetal and better paint will do the trick everytime. Acura doesn't ""build"" a car the same way Mercedes does.

If you don't believe me about Mercedes' longevity, just take a look at a used car lot that sells foreign cars. You'll find the Mercedes there in better shape than all the rest. A Mercedes can be driven to hell and back and return for more. Hondas suspension is usually shot much earlier as is the intergrity of the body.

I'm not knocking Acura at all, but Mercedes is just more car. A 1990 Legend was a good car, but a 1990 300E was better still, no matter which way you want to look at it. I seem to remember a C&D comparo in 1986 between the Legend, 300E, and Seville, needless to say the 300E won that test hands down.

The Japanese do not lead the Germans when it comes to in-car technology, only quality and production methods. I'll readily admit that the Japanese as a whole produce the highest quality cars on earth, yet for all of that European cars are more popular than ever in this country. That would lead me to believe that either the Japanese quailty/reliability arguement is loosing steam (i.e. isn't *always* what its cracked up to be) or that all these European cars aren't so bad after all.

I'm not going to get into the E vs LS, LS vs S debate again, we've done that a many times before in this thread and others. All I'll say to that is the CR doesn't mean squat to the enthusiast who isn't about to buy something they don't want because they say it's more reliable. ""But it is the most reliable, dependable, available and therefore durable car ever made."" That remains to be seen, sure it's relaible and dependable, but durable, that will be determined years from now. From what I've seen 1990s S-Classes are the most durable cars made. Pure reliabilty will always be the domain of the Japanese.

nealm1,

I'm shocked!

ljflx,

A few exceptions to your post. Have you not read about all the transmission problems Acura/Honda owners are having as of late? Have you not seen the cheapish interiors on the newer Nissan products? From the Altima, G35 to 350Z, all cheap, hardly the pillar of quality. Have you not seen some of the more recent surveys, they indicate that cars like the Toyota Camry has ""gone south"" as you say. The Americans are doing much better, again going by surveys as most Japanese car fans like to do.

You're giving the Japanese as a whole too much credit. The only company I'm convinced that really does have a superior quality reputation is Toyota, and they aren't perfect. Read some of the Honda and Nissan topics here and tell me they are head an shoulders above all the European brands. Only VW comes to mind as being any worse.

""I also have no faith in MB's drive by wire."" Care to explain that one to me? Drive by wire?
Throttle, steering, brakes what? Drive by wire has been on various German cars since 1990. Your lack of faith is sorely unfounded.

Pay attention! It's equally ridiculous to consider a CD player as technology. Do you buy your cars based on CD players? I hope not, mr Porsche fan. In case you missed it I have stated it many times that the Germans are not leaders in electronics.

For all they lag according to you they're still more popular than ever, so obviously it's not as big a problem as you constantly try to state.

I have listed Mercedes' faults a many times (you and I have had this conversation before), but you're one of those people who make something out of nothing every chance you get when it comes to Mercedes. So I say now who the hell cares about a CD player when the rest of the car is so right to start with, and it's not like you CAN'T get a CD player on a Benz anyway.

This conversation started out as being about Acura and Mercedes and their technology. Does Acura even compare to Mercedes in technology? No. Not even close. So again tell me what startling technology Acura has brought to the table, or is this another one of your the world vs. Mercedes rants.

""Even Maybach, supposedly the worlds most technologically advanced car, still has one of the most technologically unadvanced navigation systems. ""

Oh really, explain that one. Before you even say it, it's DVD based. So I'm listening as to how it's so behind the times.

Another incorrect statement:

""Nobody even owns cassette players, yet Mercedes did not offer standard CD players until a few years ago. That is rediculus. ""

It's ridiculously amazing how little knowledge you have on the car you love to talk so negatively about. Mercedes' have had CD players (trunk mounted CD changers) since the late 1980's. The in-dash variety is where all the controversy is, of which BMW, Porsche, Audi and Mercedes were all late in doing. Research before you post next time.

1965,"December 21, 2002 11:37AM",prattster,"Mr. Mercedes-

Not to burst your bubble, but ah the 95' Q45t was the only car in the world at the time to offer fully active suspsension be it as complex and expensive as it was around $59k. Secondly, Mercedes was not the 1st to offer the retrac. hardtop SLK, that would be the 94' Mitsu. 3000 Spyder, again another low volume expensive model around $65k for the VR4. I know that the Japanese are woking on steer-by-wire but they won't released it till it's been fully developed and tested unlike BMW's gimmicky and complicated I-drive. Lastly, who brought hybrid engine technology to market first?

Footie- I own a 95' Legend GS and it's one hellva of good, solid, reliable, well-made car. Have 76K on it so it's pretty much not even broken in. Again, the sheetmetal is heavy gauge and solid just like the Benz. and LS400, better be for $44k. Zero sqeeks or rattles to report and the quality of materials and durablity is top-notch. Reported as of the 20 best Japanese cars in Forbes.

Mercedes doesn't wipe out anybody. Their electricals and interiors are not up to Japan's best Lexi and they rush to market new technology that should spend more time in testing. Brake-by-wire is still unproven. Lexus will bring this to market when it's been thoroughly tweeked and tested. The 90's Benz's are durable but there electricals are anything but. The 90's LS400 is also one the best built cars of the time and will easliy last well past 300K but will do so with fewer problems and cost. And besides to be fair, the RL is a 7 year old design which is no one's fault but Acura but the new model will dazzle with all new technology for certain. Spring 03' release I'm told.

Mercedes quality issues of today are a major concern and their decontenting of successive models isn't helping them while they face stiff competition from Japan's best. Which I believe had a lot to do with their rushing to launch all these new models and repricing. Their in reactive mode since the LS400 debuted. The ML SUV is nothing short of a shame. Compare this to the new GX470, no comparison.

A local family friend who owns blocks of rental property and can drive about anything just bought a stunning black LS430 ultra for wifey. I asked why no Benz? He said, laughing thier not built like they used to be and besides I want the best built, most reliable luxury car in the business."

Porsche is a non issue in this discussion, we are talking about luxury cars and their consumers demands. In a Porsche I would not care one bit about music, navigation, food and drink placement, because I have only one motive: Driving. However this is about as far as can be with luxury cars. Luxury cars are for those who care less about the driving(although still quite a bit) but more about the ride, creature comforts, ergonomics, and style, etc.

And I am not saying they didnt have the technology, of course they did. BUT THEY DONT IMPLEMENT IT!!!!!!! They did not deem these things important because they thought the consumer didnt care, in which they were flat out wrong and very very late to the game. Like you say, all German Lux makes are bad at this game. They try to force their Corporate Culture and driving morals on a public who has a choice in what they drive and they paid the penalty for it.

You are right, you can get a CD player. Why werent they standard equipment? It is rediculus to have to pay extra for an option in a Mercedes when you can get it standard in a Mazda. As far as Nav systems go, they are a huge growing market in the US, and Mercedes should at least offer an optional Nav system that is up to date. They need a DVD navigation disc, they need a better screen, and a better user interface. Audi is even worse, as far as Nav systems go, which also sad.

""Everything that doesn't add value, is waste. Waste of capital, waste of time, waste of employee ability to contribute"".


Because of the way they put cars together, everything else follows. Lower cost, higher quality and virtually no defects.


Even when you spend some time reading how and why it works, it still takes some rumination to figure out how they do what they do. Then it hits you.


It is VERY different from the way traditional factories in the U.S. and Germany operate:


1) Quantity Management: Pull system with minimum inventory. Just in time, production line driven, component demand

2) Quality Management: Constant inspection at each process step. Defects stop production with no inventory.

3) Maximum use of human capabilities. Empower the worker and teams. Rewards improvements from every level.


Toyota runs their factories 'mixed' producing similar vehicles. Order to fulfillment time in Japan is 5 days and has been for a decade.


The link below gives a good summary:


http://www.dig.bris.ac.uk/teaching/m_o_i/studen10.htm


The following powerpoint presentation (58 pages long!) from MIT shows some of the differences in factory performances between Japan, Japan/US, US and Europe.


Given the way Mercedes (BMW, etc.) design their cars, build them and operate their factories, they are pretty hamstrung.


They consume an inordinate amount of capital in-production inventory, take longer to build, tolerate higher levels of defects, and despite their innovative nature, are often forced to bring products to market with technology that's not ready for prime time.


Mercedes won't go out of business, but the bar has passed them by and they fall further and further behind.


Plus much of today's significant automobile technology is electronics based.


The U.S. and Japan lead the world in electronics, microprocessors, embedded software development.


There are times that BMW and Mercedes both bring technology to market before the Japanese and U.S. companies, but it's usually buggy (Rev 4.2 already for the new 745).


They are desparately trying to figure out how to stay in play.

I've never read so much ranting about nothing. When are you going to realize that the Japanese idea of luxury isn't everybody's. You admit that it's not an issue with a Porsche, but yet you can't understand that Mercedes (across the street) from Porsche was also under the same thinking at the time. If you're going to harp about CD players with cars as basically good as BMW, MB and Audi then they're definitely not for you. You and this CD player thing is about the most ridiculous thing you've come up with yet. For your information (stay current) Mercedes, BMW and Audi are all switching to DVD based Nav systems during 2003.

""WHO THE HELL USES THOSE THINGS?""

Are you speaking of trunk mounted CD changers? I hope not, because if you are you know not of what you speak. Who uses them? Lexus, Infiniti, Acura, Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar, Audi, Cadillac, and just about every other luxury car going. Lexus, just like Mercedes didn't even offer and in-dash unit on their top LS model until recently, they too used CD changers before offering the in-dash unit with the LS430, ditto for the ES300. In-dash CD players/changers were not popular or offered up until the last few years, on any Japanese or European luxury car. So now what?


""And I am not saying they didn&#146;t have the technology, of course they did. BUT THEY DONT IMPLEMENT IT!!!!!!""

Really? Mercedes didn't implement electro-hydraulic brakes or active rollover protection either huh? Mercedes crumple zone technology is blueprint that every single car on the road today uses, and they (Mercedes-Benz) did it first! Do you really think Acura compares to a Benz in safety engineering? Please.

""f this is purely out of debate about technology, then you are right, Mercedes is better off(except on electronics). But from what I was reading in this topic, it was about whether Acura can compete with Mercedes.""

Oh so you ranted only to agree in the end. Can Acura ""compete"" with Mercedes, sure they can at the TL/C-Class level, but beyond that they have nothing even worth mentioning. Period.

""Lexus had the 6 disc in-dash cd player since 98."" Not on every model the didn't. Not in the center stack.

Dude if you can't understand the way certain car companies think than we need to stop here. It's the same reason why the Japanese don't see doing small volume expensive cars like the Europeans do with brands like AMG, M and S/RS. They don't ""see"" doing cars like those because the return is so small. Mercedes, BMW, Audi and Porsche didn't see CD players as being important because they spent so much time and effort on the aspects of car design. You know yourself that a stereo in a Benz or any high-end German car was just and afterthought up until a few years ago. I'm not saying that this excusable, I'm just telling you why it was the case.

I don't have to paint a portrait of your, your posts speak for themselves. I don't know you'd buy a C280, they didn't have an in-dash CD players, or a Nav system, the two most important features you're looking for. They have cheap dash plastics, downright pitiful handling and won't last past 100K.

10-month waiting list? wake-up and walk down to a Benz dealer. One of the biggest markets for luxury cars(Connecticut) has virtually no wait for the new E-class. To put it in perspective, my cousin recently purchased a brand new 2003 E320 and drove it home the same day. He also got about $2.5K off MSRP. On top of that, the dealer he bought his car from said, he could have gotten him a E320 just about any way he wanted in about 1-2 months, and he still would have gotten a discount.

I'm not taking anything away from the E-class and I'm not trying to bash it in any way, as the new E320 is a great automobile and a big improvement over the lame 96-02 E-class.

1988,"December 23, 2002 4:33PM",footie,"I think that you have a good point that right now there is a difference in the feel of cars in this class: Lexus the most smooth ( aka boring ), BMW the most sporting/firm and MB in the middle.

What's interesting to think about is where this will be in three or four years.

Today's vehicles are offering the ability for us to set sport, highway and soft settings in the ride and handling.

The new 745 from BMW doesn't have 'hydraulic' power steering. It's actually assisted by an electric motor instead.

The current 2003 Corvette has the most advanced adjustable on the road suspension system available. It uses an electromagnetic coil to alter fluid consistency within the shock absorbers to instantly adjust damping for road surfaces and conditions. With wheel sensors at each wheel adjusting damping force, the electromagnetic system responds five times faster than previous mechanical systems.

Magnetic Selective Ride Control is driver-adjustable, with two settings (Tour and Sport). Tour provides an amazingly controlled, smooth ride while Sport lets the driver ""feel"" the contour of the road to a greater degree.

What's going to happen in the future? Instead of just sport systems and tour, there'll be stops in between. There'll be adaptive versions that sense a significant change in road surface ( if you want it to ) and change the settings to match the new surface... like hitting a section where the pavement is getting redone.

I wouldn't be at all surprised to see Lexus (shamelessly) calibrate what the feel of a BMW or Benz is like. They'll have the settings like we see today: tour, highway and probably Euro 1 and Euro 2. Guess what they will be.

Lexus could have a strong selling proposition to current MB and BMW owners looking for the ride and feel they like, in a virtually defect free car, delivered and serviced by a dealership that generally treats you as customer they'd like to keep.

If they use the new audio technology that Bose has to cancel outside sounds they can make a car very quiet. If they can do that they can also make the 'roar' or rumble that you hear selective too. You like the roar that the E500 or sweet song of a 745, dial it right in. You won't be able to tell the difference. They'll even make the seats buzz, just 'so'.

With superior electronics, great software and active, dynamic suspensions, steering and sound components, you will be able to you pretty much dial in the experience you want, be it enthusiast 1, enthusiast 2, highway glide or shopping center cruise.

Smart sensors will monitor the effective wear of some components over time and have the software compensate so that the 'feel' remains approximately constant over an extneded life. You won't know if the car loosens up and the dash monitor will tell you if it's out of tolerance before normal servicing. Those same sensors will monitor external and operating temperatures so that shocks for example, aren't 'hard' when you first hit the street on a frosty morning.

It's mind boggling. I am sure that all of the car companies will excel in this new era, but the sense of feel and handling that the Europeans have prided themselves on won't be something that they will alone own. Nor will Lexus's super smooth ride be theirs alone. MB and BMW will have the same capability to deliver that if they invest in the same smart technology."

A friend who just spent $75K on a new 745i proudly told me about the new electric motor technology for his power steering instead of the old hydraulics.

It is fast enought to recalculate and change the damping every time the Corvette travels 1 inch at 60 mph.

It works by changing the effective vicscosity of the fluid in the shocks.

What's really cool is that they can change it differently on opposite sides of the car to improve handling, not just ride.

I'm sure BMW and MB will be able to get this advanced technology since the system is produced by Delphi, an independent supplier of automobile parts and systems to companies all over the world.

autoweek.com/cat_content.mv?port_code=autoweek&cat_code=carnews&loc_code=&content_code=09501022

Here's an article from Autoweek back in June. It indicates that the new C6 Vette will have this ride technology standard.

"" Magnetic Ride Control uses new Delphi &#147;valveless&#148; shocks, which are designed to have better damping and ultra-quick response rates. The quick-acting shocks use a liquid called magneto-rheological fluid. The fluid, combined with computer-controlled coils, provides continuously variable, real-time damping. The fluid contains iron particles, which in the presence of a magnetic field, can align themselves into a thicker state. If the magnetic field isn&#146;t present, the fluid takes on a thinner state. The tuning levels are nearly unlimited, depending on programming and adjusting the algorithms controlling the damping responses.
...

The benefits, based on brief drives we&#146;ve done in the 50th Anniversary car and some Sevilles equipped with the system, are fantastic: The ride is better, there&#146;s less body roll, less dive under hard braking and squat under hard acceleration, and faster body and wheel control.

Can you share the link for the Autoweek review where they didn't like it. I looked hard throughout their site and couldn't find any negative comments. It's always helpful to be able to read the original reviews to get the complete story.


In terms of your conclusions about who will or won't use this over time, I am staying open to the idea and learning a bit more. It seems to me that the days of 'pure mechanical' systems that constituted technology where German companies like BMW and MB had a lead in the 60's and 70's, are long gone.


Today, the innovation starts with advanced electronics as a major degree of freedom in design. Shocks are no different, and have been integrated into the electronically controlled suspension and braking systems. They've just been pretty passive up to now. The big difference with MR and why it's such an improvement over even air-damping and cushioning systems, is that the working fluid in the shock is active and controllable in real time by microelectronics. Air doesn't respond to high speed electromagnetics very well.


I like MR's chances! I hope that Toyota/Lexus adopt it. It will be a stepping stone to dial-a-ride with the European Profiles I mentioned in an earlier post.


The underlying technology wasn't developed by GM or Delphi as it turns out. But Delphi is productizing the MR in the 50th Anniversary Vette and STS.


MR is also being used in bus and heavy equipment seats (Class 8 machinery) to reduce vibration and increase operator safety. It's being used in sesmic mitigation. prosthetics, and consumer product vibration reduction applications (washing machines). It's protected by numerous U.S. patents held by a U.S. company.

1997,"December 26, 2002 12:51PM",fjk57702,"One thing I do know about Cadillac's computer controlled suspension (magnetic or otherwise) is that it is expensive to maintain. The shocks do wear out and will need replaced as they age. For the STS and the Corvette, the shocks will provide both a good ride and good handling (but perhaps not at the same time)."
1998,"December 26, 2002 2:29PM",footie,"I think all shocks wear out and require replacement. I would tend to think that both replacement parts and labor are high in general for cars that qualify for this forum.

I feel that one of the advantages of the magnetic technology is that the shock control system can measure the shock's performance versus expected results and compensate, both for temperature and wear. This should aid the components life.

I think if you read some of the MR links you might conclude that they provide a system for both good ride and good handling. The reason being that the need for 'good handling' arises very quickly even though you might only be out for a 'comfortable' ride. I can happen when you take evasive maneuvers or just get overzealous on a challenging back road. A system like the one in the 50th Anniversary Vette and STS, can give you the 'comfort' when you want it, but be programmed to respond to 'emergencies' much like ABS/EBD/VSC does in a Lexus today. The MR suspension plays an active role in emergency handling, limiting body roll and its effects on lateral weight distribution. This tends to keep the inside tires firmly in contact with the roadway and more weight on them."

2000,"December 26, 2002 10:10PM",wishnhigh1,"footie is correct, the days of mechanical innovation is over, its all about electronics and materials now. MR is a great innovation, and I havent heard anything bad about it, but I do realize its shortcomings.

First of all, it only modifies damping rates, it does not control release rates, IIRC. Also, it does not modify spring rates, only the shock absorbers. The spring rates, in combination with the damping factors, are really what gives that ""European Ride"" so I dont see how the shocks alone are going to help too much.


You also have to consider that suspension geometry, car weight distrobution, torque to the wheels, etc all affect handling to a great degree, and there is no one single fix that will dramatically change a cars dynamics on the fly.


Its a good innovation, but the rest of it needs to be there before we get to your idealogical car utopia, footie."
2001,"December 27, 2002 7:46AM",footie,"You are of course, right. There's much room for improvement in many areas of handling.

Without going to far into la-la land, I would expect that almost everything in a suspension that is 'fixed' today, like link lengths and geometry, gets a good hard look for becoming variable and smart.

On the MR shocks, if I understand your comment correctly, they do control both jounce (compression) and rebound (expansion).

It's also the case that in the Vette and STS, the roll, dive and pitch are controlled better by the use of these shocks. For example in the case of pitch, you can stiffen both ends of the vehicle at the same time having the front resist nosediving and the rear resist uplift. You can carefully control the ratio of these two to get the desired effect.

With older technology, the shocks are dumb and can't tell the difference between the wheels falling in a pothole or the front of the car nosediving. The systems based on (electro) or standard mechanical valving reacts the same way to both events. It doesn't matter whether they are air or liquid based."

2003,"December 30, 2002 3:29PM",markcincinnati,"What are some of the opinions regarding Audis A8 air suspension efforts (presumably on the upcoming A8 and S8 a couple years later?)

I now have 3500 miles on a new allroad and I assume that the allroad was a bit of a mule for Audi to test some of the air suspension technologies on. Of course the allroad does not have a dynamic suspension -- it IS active but it does not act except when told to -- and never rapidly (other than the ride height reductions that happen ""automatically"" at certain speeds -- the faster you go the lower it goes, that is).

I would assume that if an air suspension could be made to be both active and truly dynamic -- in real time (or close -- perhaps 10 times per second) it would be (or perhaps could be) ""better"" than other suspensions, e.g., fluid filled, etc.

Anyway, what do you anticipate Audi will do with their S8 (in 2005 perhaps) with respect to the suspension systems.

I bought a new 1997 A8 and ordered an S8 suspension for it from Joe Hoppen -- and even though it was a ""conventional"" suspension, the A8 with S8 underpinnings (and tires and wheels, too) was one of the best riding and handling cars I have ever had, even to this day.

It seems tall enough. And the headlights are right off of an 80's Cadillac. Did I mention it had iDRIVE... At least there's no ""flame"" styling. Looks like Rolls will have to put up with the shipping crate jokes that Volvo used to have to take."
2010,"January 6, 2003 8:51PM",ljflx,"Agree - the Bentley is the best looking car out of them all. Looked closer at the Rolls and Maybach today and changed my mind. There is something special about the Maybach and that interior is spectacular. I love a lot of high quality wood (which is why I like the LS430 interior so much) and the Maybach is loaded with it and it's interior looks like it has all top shelf materials and is very stylish to boot. I assume MB will take the S interior to a higher level by 2006 - on the coattails of the Maybach.

By the way the pics I've seen of the new 5 series - if they are representative - are absolutely terrible. MB should clean-up with the E vs. that thing and if Lexus makes the GS more stylish it will also put some hurt into BMW.

The comments that BMW makes about the 7-series - that people will have to come to appreciate its style (I guess because they think they cannot do anything wrong) - are the most absurd I've ever read. I guess we will soon be reading the same thing about the 5-series. The question I have is who is paying off Chris Bangle - MB, Lexus or both."

On the flipside of that, the 7-Series just had it's best sales year ever in the U.S. So somebody (?) likes the 7-Series' look.

I'm going to Detriot in 12 days so I'll see the Maybach and Phantom then.

ljflx,

Yep, the next S-Class is supposed to be closely related to the ""Bach"", interior and all. My only worry is that they'll try to make it look like a smaller Maybach. I don't want that.

The Cien, while cool, did not recieve as universal of praise as this car has in the last few days. I think the Cien has a limited production possibility, but wouldnt be suprised if it wasnt produced. The Sixteen, however, has everything to do with the new marketing scheme and target demographic that Cadillac is after, and I wouldnt doubt for a second that it wouldnt be produced.

2016,"January 7, 2003 11:56PM",wishnhigh1,it may be a bit before its time. We do need a suitable replacement for the Deville and Seville and possibly the Eldorado before a high end car like this can start building lust and prestige in a brand.

But, unlike MB & BMW, they're not global brands. That makes a big difference. When BMW comes out with a new model, they sell it and recoup the investment all over the world. When Caddy comes out with a new model, they sell it mostly here in North America.

That's why Caddy & Lincoln were so eager to go global a few years ago. But Lincoln had to abandon last year. If Caddy is serious, it has to shell out billions of dollars for dealerships, repair shops, training etc. even before it can sell any cars.

That's one dilemma Caddy & Lincoln face. To be fully competitive, they have to go global. But to go global requires huge investments that they can't make now. Now Lincoln can share development costs with Jaguar, but the combined Lincoln/Jag is only a fraction of the size of MB or BMW."

Everyone knows Mercedes made the Maybach, but they didn't name it a Mercedes because they felt Mercedes didn't have the name to challenge Rolls Royce, and would thus loose sales because of perception. But since everyone knows it was made by Mercedes (and it looks quite like one), I for one think the rename had no effective purpose. If Mercedes can build a great car like the Maybach, why not get credit for it? Perception would simply rub-off on its other models. Cadillac has taken the route of building a 16 cylinder car to help its perception and reputation. Sales are not the car's main goal as much as improving brand image, while the Maybach was made simply to take sales from Rolls and Bentley."

2035,"February 6, 2003 10:35PM",merc1,"Been away for a while, well fear not I'm back.

The Detroit Show was a true delight. I have never seen so much luxury and power on display.

The stars of the show were the Cadillac Sixteen, Maybach 62 and Rolls-Royce Phantom.

I missed my chance to sit in the Rolls by ""that much"" This is huge and elongated car. The interior is much nicer in person than it is in the pics on the net. The Rolls faithful will be pleased.

The car my friends and I voted ""most needed to be built"" is the Cadillac Sixteen. Too bad I don't have a reliable digital camera, I got some great shots of the V16 engine. Cadillac would truly be worldclass if they built anything like the Sixteeen.

The Maybach nearly generated a riot with people jumping up on the platform trying to get closer to it. The Maybach's magic is in it's interior, because truthfully the Cadillac Sixteen and Bentley Arnage look much better out the outside. Maybe the smaller 57 model will look better proportioned, it wasn't there.

There was some surprises for me. I actually liked the Infiniti FX45 and the G35 Coupe. I'll definitely have to give the G35 Coupe a test drive when the time comes.

Lexus isn't going to be able to meet demand for the RX330, it looks a lot better than the RX300.

BMW's 7-Series continues to draw a lot of attention at the show and sales (2002 sales were much better than 2001). I don't really get it, but ok.

Mercedes is putting 4Matic on every model that has more than 2 doors. The new SL600 was there and according to it's spec sheet it has a 6-speed automatic, I'm going to predict that this new 6-speed auto will become standard across the range, or at least for all S, CL, SL and E Class cars for 2004.

The Audi A8 didn't make the heart flutter like it should have. It almost to ""conservatively-handsome"" for it's own good. It does though have the best interior of the big three German luxury sedans. I just doesn't look as good as a S-Class on the outside. I won't go into detail about how bad I want an RS6.

Cadillac's XLR was like the Audi A8 somewhat of a disappiontment. It's too square and blocky, just doesn't have the look of a 75K car.

Ferrari, Aston-Martin, and Lamborghini drew the usual ooohs and ahhhs.

The Bentley Continental GT isn't a looker either, now that I've actually seen it. It's interior isn't up to the Arnage's standard either. I heard other people saying the same thing, so who knows.

Thats pretty much it on the luxury front at Detroit.

The rear end does look like an Eldorado, true....but hey the car won't be built so I'm somewhat less critical on that because in the end it doesn't matter.....the car had so much else that was ""right"" about it. I was just taken by the whole presentation of the car.

ljflx,

It's been kinda quiet around here lately I see. Well I figure Lexus will have trouble with meeting demand for the RX330 because even I thought it looked much better than the previous RX300.
The Infiniti FX45 was another surprise. I've already seen one on the road around here. It has the 1920's gangster look about it, you know the short, stubby, fat cars they used to ride in. In short I like it. I got a detailed, hands-on look at Detroit. This crossover is truly just that, and should be a bit hit for them.

The only thing Infiniti isn't getting totally ""right"" is the interiors of these cars, the G35 Coupe deserves a better interior, with less of the tacky aluminum-look plastic. Other than some interior issues and the sort of longish-looking wheelbase I think the G35 Coupe will make my short list when the time comes.

Infiniti seems to be alive now. All they need to do now in order to complete their makeover is a work on the Q45 and quit marketing it as a sports sedan (thats what the M45 is for) and something to replace the truly boring (but fast) M45.

Did you see the SRX? I wasn't too impressed by pics of the sheetmetal and interior!

I heard a new M45 is coming within about a year. Even though it's new to the US market, the identical Gloria has been in Japan for quite a while. And it shows, as you said!"
2043,"February 10, 2003 8:17AM",merc1,"Well to tell you the truth I really couldn't get a good detailed look at the new XJ. Though from what I saw of it looked just like the old car, only larger. Jaguar only had one on a stand and it was all silver, you know that pure aluminum look. The one on the floor was crowded by people so there was no chance to get a ""perspective"".

I've been on record for being critical of the X-Type. That said I think it's a decent car, but doesn't truly live up to the Jaguar theme of exclusiveness. Jaguar will try and tell you that they made it awd for an advantage, but the truth is that was done to keep it from being fwd. AWD just doesn't fit the Jaguar image. Nobody is thinking tough, winter, go-anywhere car when driving a Jaguar.

The way I've always seen Jaguar is a small exclusive brand...well Ford doesn't want that, they want Jaguar to be a volume brand. Jaguar was never meant to be a ""volume"" shop on the same scale as Mercedes, BMW or the Japanese brands. Jaguars were always the type of car you either liked or didn't.

I have no problems with the S-Type, as a matter of fact I'm quite fond of it, having done some seat time in a S-Type R. The 2003 model is so much better than the 2000-2002 model.

I'll have to see the new A8 on the street to make my final judgement. I didn't like the exterior of the SRX at all. I couldn't see the interior, they only had one on a stand.

2050,"March 7, 2003 9:01PM",ljflx,"I saw my first Maybach on the road today - going into NYC via Lincoln tunnel. It was disgustingly dirty as are all my cars and just about every car on the road here. Wish we could get the type of rain you get in one of those heavy summer thunderstorms to get rid of the snow and road salt. Anyway I must say that I didn't think the car was as beautiful or regal as its pictures. In fact at first I almost thougt it was a Lincoln Continental. I had to look a few times because the back lights were clearly MB style but the fluted look threw me off. It was the 57 and though I know it is a massive car it just didn't look as big as I expected. But you can't miss the rear window curtains.

Now remember it was dirty and I was driving on a very busy road so this is not a fair review. What is interesting is that when I got out of the tunnel and headed west I saw a black S-class pulling into a parking garage. This car was, somehow, spotless and looked like it had just been detailed. So it looked its best and the Maybach its worst from a cleanliness standpoint. I thought to myself that the S-class (it was a 2003) is a far more beautiful and elegant car than the Maybach. Despite all our differences over the years I'll also tell you that I honestly think the S is the most beautiful large sedan on the road - if not the most beautiful ""ordinary"" production car out there. But I prefer the Lexus LS for a host of different reasons.

On a personal note - make sure you give career changes a lot of thought and don't hesitate to seek out advice from close friends and family. Stay well."

2054,"March 12, 2003 6:29AM",rmorin2,I am buying a 2000 740iL today and want to get a good aftermarket warranty. Am leaning toward Warranty Gold Diamond Plan. Would really appreciate some feedback from folks with experience on claims processing from WG and others. Thanks.
2055,"March 17, 2003 11:28AM",sysadb,"I bought the Diamond plan for my 740i last June, and had the occasion to use it for a small repair ($300) last month. I bought the WG plan because the Diamond has the most comprehensive coverage I could find, and WG gives you coverage from the date you buy the plan, instead of when the car was put in service. I wanted the extra time more than the milage.

Making a claim was not a red-carpet experience, due to the adversarial position between the BMW dealer and WG. I suspect this would be a problem with other warranty companies as well, as they all use their price schedules to authorize the amount that they will cover. As you might suspect, that price was lower than what the BMW dealer wanted. In my case they cut the dealer about $100. The dealer grumbled but reduced the price, but I think I have a good idea what would happen if they tried to cut a $4,000 repair by 33%. One caveat - do not have service work done at the same time as the repair. The dealer may have buried the $100 in the other work. The authorization of the amount for the work may be much less of an issue if you use a shop with lesser repair charges than a BMW dealer, so that's something to weigh.

The reimbursement itself is handled one of two ways. If you sign the repair order the dealer can fax it to WG and get it paid via credit card. But this means you have to sign and fax it AFTER the work is done, and then wait for the dealer to call and get his money. My dealer was already disgruntled about long waits getting through, so I paid him and submitted the claim myself. That method takes about 30 days, though, to get the money.

All in all, none of this is surprising, and I don't really mind the process. As long as the policy covers my expense I'm happy. I would like my BMW dealer to be a little more cooperative, but I didn't bank on that. I WOULD recommend that you discuss the coverage with your repair shop that you use 1st though, just to make sure they'll honor the plan.

And, as is probably apparent, I am far less concered about the ""originality"" of a car's appearance than is merc1. So be it.

But I think it is significant that merc1 starts this rant about all Lexi being copies and the alleged utter lack or originality of the marque, and when pressed, he cites only the current release of a single model (the current LS) as his proof. The RX is the trendsetter in its niche, not a ""copy."" The GS doesn't look like anything else, and neither does the IS. The LX? Looks like the TLC, but everything else in the market has followed them.

As for the RR, I did see it on Motorweek, and thought it was just hideous on the outside. Really atrocious. One of the great, elegant traditional styles butchered.

If you think Lexus is an original brand you're a lot more off base than I thought you ever could be. Everything they've done (except the RX300) is to catch up to or mimic somebody else, and not just Mercedes-Benz.

The weakest part of Merc1's point to me has always been his view that the LS is a pure copy of the old S but the latter is beautiful and the LS is ugly. Sorry - but that fails the Logic 101 test.

I love the past generation E-class styling but I don't even see a faint resemblance to it in the GS. I've seen the front headlights given as an example but that is absurd. If one were to buy that than my LX470 must be an E-class copy because it has similar headlights to the GS. Don't see any resemblance in the SC or IS (someone please explain what you see)and the SUV's are pure Lexus/Toyota.

Is the LX470 an overpriced TLC? I certainly don't think so. But merc1 is entitled to his opinion.

Now if you want to see cars that look alike I must say that I can't tell the difference between a Land Rover and the G-500. If there is an overpriced vehicle on the road the latter takes the cake. It looks tinny, small and cheap to my eyes.

As for the Japanese as designers - they will never have the creativity of the Europeans or the Americans. When was the last time anyone saw a great movie from a Japanese director? These people are driven to perfection but not in creative design. But man can they make a car that is flawless and is built as well as any MB ever was.

As for the design issue - it doesn't take much to hire a high quality Italian design team. When they do that all talk of poor styling and copying will end very quickly."

Mine is a 2 Lexus family. I don't care for their design work either, and chose Lexus for other reasons.

The old GS was Giugiaro-designed, so I absolutely agree that they should hire Italian designers again!

Why does any bother to respond to my posts? Same reason you are, you're in denial. Let me see if you can get this. There is a difference between copying a styling theme (a shiftgate pattern) and offering the same thing that EVERY luxury car offers (NAV). Do you understand that?

It's amazing how you and syswei keeping asking the same questions like a broken record when YOU and I have discussed this before.

ljflx,

Well...I respect you a great deal but some of things you say are just so.... The G500 and Range Rover look alike but the LS430 doesn't look like a bloated Avalon? The S-Class looks like a Taurus? Come on now. Yes I said the LS430 is a copy of the previous S-Class and yes I think the old S looked better in it's day, but you keep leaving out a key word here, the LS430 is POOR copy of the old S-Class. Thats about the third time I've had to point that out to you. I know you get that. The LS430 has the side proportions, doors and roof of the old S exactly, but the front and rear ends are ugly as all get out. How do you know that the current GS didn't have it's front end patterned after the E-Class? The G500 is tinny and cheap, my you don't know as much as I thought. The G500 is a tank on wheels. It's in the same league as the Hummer H1 as far as it's intened purpose."

Hello. You can't tell you're a broken record.
every 3rd post from you is about ""copying"".

Not to mention you haven't proven anything except that the LS430 looks like a previous generation S-class. Okay, we've basically all come to that conclusion. Now get over it and move on. Obviously, it seems like you can't do that. What would that be called? Huh. Let's see-a broken record.

If you want to discuss shiftgates(personally I think it's stupid since nobody seems to care except you). Let's talk about shiftgates. The new C-class has a leather shift boot, the German built Catera had it long before Mercedes did. So, since Opel/Vauxhall had it long before and Mercedes now has it, is it copying? Based on your definition, it sure seems like it.

Oh, and let's not forget your other contradiction.

I love all 3. The ONLY reason I didn't buy the LS430 was the look of the car. I didn't like the old body style S-Class so when Lexus came out with an even blander version of the same car they lost a potential customer. I can afford to buy anything made and I chose the Benz for it's styling handling and yes the all to often forgotten ""head turning appeal "" all in all BOth manufacturers are world class. I do agree with the gentleman that the Japanese can copy and improve on anything, but they do lack any creative gifts. Is the Benz overpriced ? Certainly, but being an economics major in undergrad I do understand why given the economic climate in Germany and the formation of the European Union. I also understand the reason I paid nearly 1500 less for the 02 GS than I did for my 99 GS is that the Japanese economy is about 200 yards from the gates of hell and still falling due to crazy political adn economic polices. Do I care ? As a consumer yes. If nothing else Lexus has forced all luxury car manufacturers to sop living off their reputation and start building cars that push the envelope with new designs and technology, all while having to compete on price. MB was forced to lower the price of their products across the board and to lure people like me they had to offer free maintenance for the first 4 years or 50k miles to overcome a common complaint amongst all lux car owners, high maintenance costs. So I say thank God for the Japanese and their "" lets go kick some German butt"" attitude. IN the long run we as consumers benefit when the worlds greatest engineers have a bar room brawl....:)Now if and when Lexus decides to build a better looking LS, I'll buy it. I even like the new BMW 7 series although I think they went overboard with the new technology. The salesman there told me that one is required to watch a 3 hour video prior to purchsing the car.

I even remember Edmunds reviewing it and drawing to a similar conclusion. They said something to the effect they thought people would wonder what they were thinking a few years after they bought one. That was my thought exactly the first time I saw one. I think it looks like something out of the Al Capone era.

As for the GS - I see no resemblance whatsoever to an E-class.

Taurus - Similar rear lights to all MB's now, similar shape (look at the lines and curves on the side) and very similar rear deck lid. Look-a-like - No. The S is far more elegant and expensive looking. I think it's a great looking car. But I would seriously doubt that MB did not take some of those Ford styling cues and perfect them.

Thus a key reason that they have been able to hold prices so low is that the yen then weakened.

The Range Rover is a Land Rover product. Same difference, the G500 doesn't look like the RR, Disco or Freelander. You couldn't be more incorrect about the Taurus and the S-Class.

There was a reason why Japan's best didn't even look at Cadillac, Lincoln, Jaguar, Audi or even BMW (until recently) for their inspiration for a luxury car, but jeeweez 13 years later and they're still aping from you know who.

Yes BMW began the whole thing in 1988 with the V12 750iL, and YES Lexus did change the landscape considerably in 1990 with new ways of selling cars and serving the customer. Not disputing that at all, my problem with Lexus is their ridiculous c ______y of that other brand. It's absurd. Nobody except a few Korean brands make their cars such knockoffs (LS430) stylewise.

Now I've driven the old Audi 5000, the A-8, the old 7-series, the 5 series, the old (quite often) and new S and the old E-class (also quite often). Maybe I'm missing it but I never got the uplifting feeling that others advertise. In fact I've concluded it's psycholigical in nature unless you are dealing with an AMG or M. I've never driven either of the latter but I can buy the exchilaration argument on those custom-like cars at least.

But while the more common sedans are all excellent cars I find the LS430 rivals or surpasses every one of them and the GS is right there with its competitors. Am I missing this exhilaration. Do you get it in your E-class vs the LS430 or is it indeed a psychological thing?

It comes from Mercedes being the first car around and all the times their name has been mentioned with greatness through the years, whether it be racing or innovations. Believe it or not being priced higher also carries a certain amount of currency with some. The rest of it is more or less what carnaught said. Mercedes' have always felt like they track down the road better than the rest, and their high-speed stability is often noted in roadtests, here is where I think Mercedes is better than anyone, including BMW. The tradeoff is that they won't change direction as quickly as say a BMW will, but BMWs are more nervous (relative) at high speeds.

Now the AMG products are even more so. Car and Driver's review of the new E55 is a testament to that. Road and Track even picked the old E55 over the current M5 when it came down to high-speed stability. Now the flipside of that is the here, few people are going to drive as fast so that above 100 mph German ""thing"" is lost on the average BMW, Audi and Mercedes owner. Porsche owners, well they're slightly different for the most part. But even with their regular models a S500 Sport is just tighter than a LS430 with it's Euro option. A car like the previous 740i Sport was outright sporting for it's class, as is the A8. I can only imagine how the new 745 Sport models feel on the road with their 19-inch wheels. The new A8 has gotten sportier too. The LS430 is easily the ""softest"" car in this class now. But I see where you're coming from, if those things are not important you won't see it.

It seems to me that the MB buyer is paying for MB's R&D and (to some extent) Lexus's R&D. The Lexus buyer, on the other hand, is getting a more refined version of the technology without paying for the full cost of development. Wouldn't any business person jump at the chance of having his competitor pay for part of his R&D? What am I missing?"
2115,"April 9, 2003 7:50PM",ljflx,"Your not missing anything as far as I'm concerned. It's smart business. Microsoft's been doing it for years and last time I looked they had the highest market cap on the planet.

It's really a braggintg rights vs. smart business thing. Who's smarter - the guy who innovates and wants to be the innovation leader or the guy who innovates occasionally and perfects the innovation of others. The first guy becomes what i call the ""technologist"" and chases a bunch of things the expensive way. Some of the innovations never become mainstream, aren't practical or are always problematic. How many cars have ABC - maybe 3 or 4% of MB's. Bad business decision. Maybe that's also why MB is having these reliability issues. It's not the pure bread auto items that cause the problems its all that technology that doesn't work the way it was envisioned that they put around them. But they can say they are the innovation leader and the enthusiasts and the auto rags buy it hook line and sinker. But the business/finance crowd has a totally different view. Hence Daimler trades at a 5x multiple while Toyota trades at more than triple that.

Now Toyota's approach is a lot smarter as far as I'm concerned. They develop the things that are, or become popular items but many of the enthusiast don't want to recognize. Witness merc1's comment about nav systems. In my opinion its pretty embarrassing to MB that a Camry or Corolla has a better nav system than an S-class. Who's smarter - the people who perfected a nav system and pushed it across the whole platform or the people who developed an imperfect ABC system and can only place it on a small percentage of cars. The answer is pretty obvious to me and to Wall street. But that is not what many enthusiasts care about. They only want to look at hard core auto development and in that viewpoint things that lead to bragging rights are more important than near perfect reliability, great nav systems or great stereos.

I'm a realist. I care about things that work perfectly almost always - that I use or enjoy almost all the time, rather than bragging about having something different, that causes poor reliability and is rarely needed in the first place."
2116,"April 9, 2003 9:37PM",merc1,"Now you bring up a very good point. A Mercedes-Benz customer is indeed paying for the R&D that goes into such things as active suspension......and Lexus is smart to take Mercedes' technologies and refine, and improve upon them....the break is that lots of people like having the original item...not the come from behind one. There is room for both camps, hence Lexus and Mercedes and BMW all selling over 200K cars a year.

ljflx,

How is ABC a bad business decision when Mercedes-Benz is making money hand over fist? I know you break these things down in the business manner and you're good at it, but the European car community just isn't *as* driven by that. Sure they want to make money, but they always keep the enthusiast in mind also. Thats why a NAV system isn't as important to me as a new suspension technology is. Yes a common everyday Toyota may have a better NAV system but when a car has a V8 or V12 capable of performing miracles nobody is going to care about a NAV system. I personally would never buy a car like an Acura TL and pay 2K for a ""map"", that is ridiculous. If it's standard equipment fine, but as option it's a waste in my opinion. This whole thing about NAV systems is funny to me because just like the Germans aren't that good at it, the same thing could be said of the Japanese when it comes to styling. Styling being a trivial thing among Japanese luxury car fans. Why, because the Japanese aren't any good at it.

Wall Street doesn't carry much weight when it comes to car development. Nor does the average high-end luxury car buyers car about which automotive stock is trading at what, unless they have some of it.

This constant following of German brands by the Japanese only adds luster to the German brands for some.

2117,"April 10, 2003 10:11AM",tasillo,"As I don't visit this site every day, I was surprised by the volley of comments between the Lexus camp and the Merc/BMW devotee's It was quite interesting to me as we own both Lexus and BMW vehicles.

I would agree 100% that for high-speed handling, roadholding, stability and braking, the German marques hold an edge. However, that edge is narrowing every day. My 740iL is a tremendous long-haul bullet, really coming into it's own at speeds above 80mph. Below that threshold however, the Lexus is the better daily driver. From an ownership standpoint however, Lexus clearly has set the bar that BMW and Mercedes are playing catch-up to.

The most disappointing aspect or car ownership is the ""aggrivation"" factor. The Germans unfortunately, own this category. Whether it's a balky trip computer, inoperative central locking, noisy A/C or routine maintenance, BMW certainly is lacking in the responsiveness department compared to Lexus. My feeling is that the mechanical and styling/design trends set by the Euro's have been easier for the Japanese to implement into their vehicles than the electronic innovations offered by Japan have been for the Euro's to perfect. I agree with merc1 that I would never select a vehicle based on the NAV system. But if it has it and I paid for it, it better work and work well. BMW (and Mercedes) CD-ROM based NAV technology is dismal compared to the Japanese (and Americans). Quality of assembly and longetivity of trim components and body hardware is also lacking compared to Japan. Finally, while I don't have one, please remember the BMW engine debacle of the mid 90's with aluminum blocks failing at extremely low mileages due to the sulfur content in US gasoline. Many owners were out 7-10k replacing engines in expensive vehicles, although eventually BMW made most owners whole again. Regardless, the resale of these vehicles took a big hit.

I realize I'm comparing BMW, not 'Benz to Lexus. I just believe that both cultures do some things extremely well and then do some things with tremendous mediocrity. As a car enthusiast, I respect all marques, but really think the Japanese have set the ownership bar and the europeans are struggling to catch up. As cars get more complex, the Japanese will gain an advantage as their skills integrating complex electronics into vehicles seem to be well ahead of the Europeans, witness the new 7 series.

Anyway, there's certainly room on the American road for both groups. As the old saying goes, ""you pay your money and you take your choice""."
2118,"April 10, 2003 10:24AM",footie,"Gosh. I thought this firefight was over, but always fun to come back in for a few rounds?

* It would seem to me that everyone has opinions on issues like the ?copying?. IMHO, no one is an authority, self-appointed or not.

* In my opinion, subjective stuff like anyone?s assertions aren't 'facts', they are just opinions just like my opinions are just opinions. It?s subjective because it can?t be measured by an objective yardstick. ?Looks like, sorta like, reminds me of? yeah, maybe. Copy no.

* It's interesting to kick around points of view here on Edmunds, but the only 'authority' at work in the end is the car-buying marketplace.

All that being said, I of course, like my own opinions and theories the best.

The Theory of Copying ? Or Never Let a Really Good Idea Go Unstolen

* Toyota entered the Luxury car market in the U.S. long after BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac, Lincoln, Rolls Royce, etc. made names for themselves, earned their wings, created an brand and image, got loyal customers. Toyota did it because those folks left a big wide opportunity for them.

* One of the challenges for Toyota ( and for Infiniti and to a lesser extent Acura ) was how to create a package that had the right mix of features, feel, style, performance and service, at the right price points, with a car that was adequately differentiated without being startling from a styling point of view. Given all the existing players, their model?s form factors, geometries of given class entries, limitations imposed by physics, materials sciences and reproducibility, the trick was to ?fit in? and ?stand out? at the same time.

* With all of the strengths that the competition brought to bear: strong mature brands, loyal customers, widespread distribution and effective logistics - Toyota would have to find an edge.

* They had three strong things in their favor:
- deep pockets - they have the most efficient factories, best profitability and highest 'market cap' of any car manufacturer
- a 'platform' approach to design that allows for a tremendous amount of flexibility in vehicle size, shape and dynamics while holding down R&D and sharing learning across 100,000's of vehicles.
- the ability to produce the most reliable cars available due to the Toyota Production System (which is highly differentiated from MB, BMW, GM, Ford, etc. and was first developed in the 1970?s)

* The research that they did must have shown them that the attackable weakness, across the board in the ""luxury"" market, was disappointing reliability in most brands, often arrogant dealerships, poor service and frequent part scarcity.

So they did the obvious:

- Leveraged all of their strengths. They spent a lot of money. They took advantage of their platforms and most importantly, the fact that they could build them in factories that are more efficient with better* suppliers than market incumbents. They do seek perfection, because failure to do so means money, time and human labor are wasted on creating defective products. Their automobiles have achieved a level of reliability, availability and quality* that no other car company can match at ANY price point. The remarkable thing is that these levels of achievement are across all of their products.

- They borrowed (or copied) features, feel, and styles that were accepted in the market and combined them to create a ?fit in and stand out? model line. They hit the performance targets on the nose including horsepower, torque, and handling.

- Built a standalone sales and service organization without peer from scratch.

From their perspective this market was 'ripe for the picking' and pick it they did.

Epilog:

You know, there used to be TV stores all over the U.S. with sets from Motorola, Zenith, RCA, GE. They required delivery assistance, lots of service and a life time of adjustments. They lasted a few years and had to be upgraded. They were leading technology. Their advantage was brand, merchandising and local presence. They left the same kind of market entry for Japanese competition as the car companies have.

The only way Sony, JVC, etc. could enter the market was to ?copy? what they had and make them service free, easy to use and self-adjusting. They made products that lasted for a very long time.

The other guys aren?t in that market anymore. They stopped being technology leaders at the peak of their market leadership as the new entrants had to figure out how to make their sets work better, last longer and work out of the box without service for years. You don?t upgrade their sets. They aren?t designed to be ?serviced? after sale.

Did the Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba and JVC sets look like Zenith, Motorola, RCA and GE. Sure they did ? for a while. Four legs ? round or square, hifi then stereo sound, built in record players and radios, sure. Now that the other guys are gone, they set the styling.

For the record, the US patent and trade market office shows 8,060 issued patents assigned to Toyota. There are 2,227 assigned to Daimler Benz.

I think this story is playing out just the same as TV sets."

tasillo,

Very interesting post. I cannot take issue with most of it. I'm not knocking Lexus for their quality or anything on that level, its the other side, the enthusiasts side that finds their cars lacking. About the two different cultures, that is the same thing I stated on the News and Views boards. The Germans and Japanese just have a different concept of luxury. German carmakers didn't understand or care about lots of things they thought were trivial like cupholders, stereos, or nav systems. They simply didn't see those things as being important, as they weren't in Germany. Not until customer here demanded them did they act. Thing thing that gets me is that some speak of the Germans' cars as having complete junk for their NAV, stereo systems etc. Obviously it can't be that bad as some try to make it seem other wise the cars wouldn't continue to sell year after year. I also disagree with out about material and mechanical longevity, or at least when it comes to Mercedes-Benz. I totally disagree. MB's aren't falling apart any higher rate than any Toyota/Lexus product is.

I do agree that reliability is not a negotiable thing, for the most part. Agreed, all cars should be reliable, but like footie stated Lexus had the chance to start from scratch and address every weakness the existing luxury brands had. That in itself was stunningly brilliant.

footie,

The number of patents means what? Are you saying that Toyota has contributed more to advancement of the automobile than Mercedes-Benz? I hope not. You do realize that you can get a patent for simply improving an existing idea? I bet if we look at that list Mercedes-Benz has more firsts than anyone else, only Cadillac or Peugeot would be close. Having researched patents before I can tell you that just because someone has a ""patent"" doesn't mean it revolutionized anything.

2122,"April 11, 2003 5:47AM",footie,"Patents are a way of protecting intellectual property for a period of time.

Almost all of them are incremental, because true innovations are rare. However, none of us want to ride around today with ABS braking systems that were developed and patented in the 50's and 60's. Good ideas, even great innovations, require refinement and testing before being widely deployed in marketplaces.

Sometimes history even loses track of who was first on very major stuff.

The oldest patent that I can find for disc brakes and ABS was filed in 1949 by Dunlop Rubber Company in the UK and granted in 1952. It wasn't Japanese or German because I would expect that they were still rebuilding after the war. Have you found earlier ones?

A8 - ""The cabin architecture is just as fine as the exterior styling. Nobody does interiors better than Audi and this is one of the maker's best. Clean and simple instrument binnacle....Move off it's a quick car...the fastest here. It's the sportiest car here.""

S350- ""The Benz is the least suited at charging on the twisties, yet as good as any car at devouring the motorway miles. Wind noise is better than the Jaguar, and tyre noise is better than the Audi. It's a handsome, if conservative shape, more modern than the Jaguar, more stately than the Audi and better balanced than the 7. The cabin is fetching. The Quality of materials use is the best here and there is a solidity and built-for-life feel about the Benz. You can see why the S dominates this class, outselling it's rivals in virtually every country....The Benz feels the best made and probably offers the best prestige, despite its ubiquity. Yet it's not going to win here. In V8 guise it may win.....As a V6 it can't quite match it's 8-cylinder oppostion.""

735i - ""The BMW is the best on the motorway, has the most refined powertrain, is the most relaxing to drive, has the most room and ticks more luxury car boxes than any other. But I can't live with the those looks or controls. This BMW is badly let down by it's design....But the more I study and stare at a 7-Series, the worse it looks. It's a mess especially around that twin layer tail. The interior is just as bad..........""

XJ8 - ""The power-to-weight ratio is also best in class, shading the A8. It doesn't acclerate as har as the Audi and has a slower top speed (blame blunter aerodynamics). Step behind the wheel.......and the it feels like a more old-fashioned car than the Audi or 7-Series. A classic car, almost, both inside and out. Old fashioned it may be...but still handsome and classy. Inside the car feels cosy, warm. There is the low-speed magic carpet ride of the XJs of yore mixed with almost sports saloon-like sharpness when the going gets fast. No car in this comparison has better ride/handling mix.""

Otherwise, I was satisfied. However, last week also had to take the Lexus SC430 in due to a tire pressure light on. Tire pressure was fine, the Lexus dealer looked it over, advised we had hit a curb or pothole and not only broken the sensor in the wheel but also cut the tire (Dunlop run-flats), although the tire was holding air fire. Not only did Lexus replace the sensor, but also replaced the tire, all under warranty! Saved me about $700.

I love the way the BMW drives, but slowly the Lexus mantra of an exceptional overall ownership experience is winning me over!

Also, when I picked up my BMW, I spent some time looking over the new 745iL. I don't like the exterior styling but could learn to live with it. What I couldn't live with however is the interior. Not a driver oriented cockpit at all, way too complex, even overlooking i-Drive. In fact, the interior reminded me a lot of the mid '80's Thuderbird/Cougar, non- functional center console with way too many seat adjustment buttons.

Good choice! The G35 is great entry lux sedan.
I wouldn't have bought the 7-series with the 4.0L V8 in it either, even if it was a new engine.

HOw's your G35 equipped? Color? How much discount you get?"
2151,"June 8, 2003 4:18PM",ficuss,"I leased the 03 black G35 with leather, winter package, and premium package. They would only budge 7% off list. In keeping with the overall car buying experience over the last 25 yrs, I still feel like I was had, but I like the car. They have a new thing now, instead of calling it a lease, they call it a purchase with a baloon payment at the end. Anytime during the 4 yr. period, I can buy or sell the car. I can refinance the amount borrowed if I choose and make my payments early to save on interest charges. Payments are made to a bank, not an automotive credit issuer, like GMAC. I'l let you know more tomorow, after I pick up the car.

I've spoken with several owners of new 745's and while no one hated their car, no one professed undying love for it either. Lot's of electronic gremlins and complicated controls that clouded their driving and owning experience. Recent Merceded products have had their share of the electronic bugs, but their controls are straightforward and with close to 500 horsepower, I'd say the big Mercedes would be my pick as well, if I had 130k to spend.

As is, I just ordered new Pirelli's for my 740 and still think the used '98-01 740i/iL is the best deal out there on the pre-owned market."

Aside from the loose exhaust, constantly squeaking doors(probably due to the door moldings(?) made of cheap rubbers) and blown climate control fuse, I did not have much problems with the car. I was actually planning on purchasing the new 745i in September when the new 5's goes on sale. (I actually loved the new exterior design). I thought the great performance and the prestige was worth a few trips to the dealership from time to time... UNTIL NOW.
I've just witnessed a brand new (3 month old) 745i parked right next to my 5'er burnt to the ground. The car's engine caught on fire RIGHT NEXT TO MY CAR as he was trying to pull out of the parking space of a shopping center for no apparent reason.
The fireman (came in 2 minutes after called. Good work!) after putting the fire out said that it is probably due to a bad electrical wiring. The owner of the 7, an asian man probably in his mid 50's, was almost crying as he saw his babied 7 go down in flames. Luckily, my car was fine except for the inches of dust that fell on the car from the fire.
I was aware of the electrical issues with the new 7's. But seeing it in person was an awakening experience. I've owned 2 BMW's during the last 7 years and I was dead set on purchasing another one. Today's incident TOTALLY made me change my plans.
WHen you purchase a BMW, they subscribe you the BMW magazine for free as a compliment to the owners. It almost always contain pictures of totalled BMW's with owner's letters thanking them how the car saved their lives. May be so. But it would be nice to see the totalled 7 with the owner face in shock in their magazine.
No matter how great the performance is, it is not worth the risk you are taking in terms of reliability.
I was never a fan of Toyota's (I used to despise them). But right now I think my hard earned dollars are probably going to go to Lexus the next time around. It just makes sense."

I think BMW earned the position they have had. I also think the editors try to be objective, but there is going to be some bias creeping in. Most of the magazines have not added a CTS to their long term test fleets. Perhaps they are waiting for the 2004 3.6 liter engine, which is going to be available only with the automatic (at least to begin with)."
2166,"June 16, 2003 7:12PM",ljflx,"I've been around - I got back from Chicago on Thursday - but I'm staying out of the merry-go-round discussion on the Lexus vs. MB board this time. Some Saturday this summer I'll get around to a local dealer that sells RR's and Audi's. It's where I tested the old A-8. I'm actually interested in taking a look at the new RR. I did think the paint job on the A-8 I saw at the auto show was the best I've ever seen on a car. Audi doesn't skimp on anything in/on the A8 - that is for sure.

Everyone of these cars is up to auto excellence standards and I can't imagine that anyone of them will disappoint the buyer if bought for his/her desired automotive reasons. I've gotten used to great reliability so I'm spoiled by it. The fact that Lexus LS delivers the ride and quietness I love coupled with that reliability leads me back there.

I think autospies is 50% guess and 50% real on facts. I'm interested to see how accurate they are with the 2004 LS redo they talked up a while back. I did read it there first and it was quite a while before anyone else picked it up. By the way I'm curious as to what you thought of the GS redesign they showed. I thought it was a great looking car.

Lastly - where is the A8 redesign in the mix of S,LS,7 and A8? Is it first and in the lead or last and catching up. I always thought it was in the lead on the redesigns followed by MB, Lexus and BMW. If that is the case than you have to measure it vs. the redos of the other 3 as they come out. One great thing about the A8 is its scarcity. With only 2k a year sold here you are rather unique on the road when you drive one."
2167,"June 16, 2003 9:42PM",merc1,"Ok I'll go for that. I do think the editors already had it in their mind about the 03 CTS so it's probably best that they get the improved version for a long-term test.

ljflx,

That board will never be the same without your participation!! Anyway I haven't seen the autospies picture of the GS redo. I'll have to look it up.

It's hard to say who is where with redoing their flagships. The A8 came out in 1994, but wasn't sold here until 1997. So it was out before all of the current S/7/LS models. I guess I don't look at it like that with Audi because the A8 had been around so long.....it's probably safe to say they've leapfrogged the current group of cars. It's a stunner. I want to hear about the RR Phantom the minute you take a look at it.

I'll post on the other board but not in a circular discussion where everyone has already made their points. I do agree with you on your BMW 7 ""fire"" point - its a quick jump to a conclusion that may be dead wrong.

If you check autospies for the GS take a look also at the S redesign for 2005 or 2006 they showed. I also thought it looked great though I saw a post on the S board - I believe - where someone said they didn't like it at all.

I was recently looking into this, and from 1993 to 1995 (think that's correct) BMW used a nickel alloy engine, called Nikasil. This alloy, combined with the relatively high sulphur content of gas sold in some US regions, hastened pitting of the cylinder walls. BMW extended the warranty, but if you buy it used, you're probably not going to be covered.

BMW evidently had some success with this engine/alloy in their motorcycle line. It did not translate well to automobiles, however."

Technical prowess and beauty isn't worth much if you can't or don't have confidence in the automobile.

If I'm going to spend $60k plus on a vehicle I expect perfection or something real close to it. I think in the future you'll see that cars that don't live up to that will lose market share - MB included. People may look past things once but most don't get burned twice."

Sometimes (like in this case) I can't believe that you're seriously holding those two cases against such a fine and completely new vehicle. Since you already have what 3(?)

2189,"June 25, 2003 1:45AM",jagboyxtype,"I expected it to be a little more volumptuous somehow, probably because of some of the concept sketches I've seen, like the ones below:

http://car.kak.net/bilder/maserati/maserati_quattroporte01s.jpg

Maybe I'll have to see it in person and get the full effect of mass and proportion, but right now, the XJ and S-Class are my picks for best looking cars in the class. I do like the Buick-like vents along the side (I'm not being sarcastic - I think they really jazzed up the Park Avenue and look good on the Quattroporte too). The way the doors meet the bottom of the car reminds me a little of the 7-Series though, along with the rather bland, blank sides themselves, and that's not a good thing.

http://car.kak.net/bilder/maserati/maserati_quattroporte04s.jpg

I really want to like the car, but it just doesn't seem ""fresh"" or ""new"" or inspiring enough from these pics to capture me yet. The Maserati coupe/convertible were already a few years old before they came here (well, the coupe and its general styling which transfered to the convertible that was new), and I had already seen the coupe in Europe with the different rear end styling - which was more unique and desireable than the U.S. version IMHO. This Quattroporte carries a lot of the same theme, and I find it a little dated already. The interiors I've seen elsewhere were beautiful though. I think I just have to become more accustomed to it, but Maserati's designes seem bland IMO. Just get a volumptuous Ferarri and be done with it, or a Jag or Merc.

http://car.kak.net/bilder/maserati/maserati_quattroporte05s.jpg

I do like the hood proportions and the way the A-pillars meet the body of the car - looks a little Aston Martin to me, but the rest of the exterior of the car dissappointed me."
2190,"June 25, 2003 3:19AM",merc1,"Yeah I was kinda thinking the same thing. It doesn't have as many curves as I thought it would have. I'll reserve final judgement until I get to actually ""see"" it.

Jagboyxtype, what do you think of the new A8?

M"
2191,"June 25, 2003 5:08AM",jagboyxtype,"I haven't seen it in person either. However, I think it has a pretty clean, organized design all around, with a sporty Germanic, machine flair to it. I like how the wheels fill up the wheel wells - Audi has always styled the flares around the edge of the wheel wells nicely, and I like the simple pillar arches and their shapes. The C-pillars taper nicely into the rear quarters at good angles from the rear 3 quarter views I've seen. Overall, I'd say it is a handsome car. But like the XJ, it may be a little too conservative in some peoples' views, though its sheer size (I've read it's larger than the S-Class, 7-Series, and XJ) might give it a lot of presence on the road. The interior also looks to be quite nice in a simple modern fashion as opposed to classic, almost overstated elegance like the XJ - but both come off well. I like the unclutteredness of the car's detailing, and can definitely see how VAG is trying to make the Audis look sporty and upscale v. luxurious and upscale, as the Phaeton fills that role. Truthfully, beyond that, I haven't really given it a whole lot of thought though, so I hope I haven't dissappointed you with my rather skin-deep analysis of the vehicle. Though it's aluminum intensive, I also read that it is still quite a heavy vehicle and that it doesn't feel exactly light the way the other aluminum car here does - the XJ - but I haven't actually checked the weight stats on the cars, so I cannot be sure. Stylistically though, it gets great marks in my book, as do S-Class and XJ (and you know how much I like those, so it's a real complement).

CAR did a comparison that I gave a cursory glace at, but I did not read the whole article; just the captions for the pictures - and you know what car I was interested in within the group. Didn't the A8 win the comparison? I believe it did, and the Jag didn't do so badly either. They were rather harsh to the Bimmer, saying something along the lines of it trying to scare the Jaguar away with its ugly rear end, and at another point saying that although the XJ was following the 7 in the photo, the XJ was a superior vehicle. I didn't read much about the A8, and that might be its only flaw - it doesn't grab attention so much as the curvy Jag and sleek Mercedes (at least in photos) - even the 7, though not aesthetically pleasing in the traditional sense, grabs your attention. But that is the problem with photographs - the proportions and sheer mass of the vehicle do not come through to create the car's presence, and Audi's styling, being modernized, sporty-simplistic, relies a lot upon balance and dimension for its true effect. A lot of the beauty of the car is in its 3 dimensions.

For market shars, the other cars it is against also all have names that carry solid reputations: BMW is supposedly ""the Ultimate Driving Machine"" and the hot thing right now - it is known to be a great drive and technologically advanced to a perplexing degree; Mercedes is more luxury oriented but massively powerful and holds its own in terms of performance, it is to some the ultimate status car and is known to be solid all around with technology under every panel that doesn't confuse the driver like iDrive does, though Command may have to be learned for a few minutes; Jaguar, though with a bad rep for quality (despite being one of the top brands in terms of quality in reality), also carries a powerful name that to some is up there with Mercedes-Benz, it is slightly mysterious being that its numbers are more limited and its world class wood and leather interiors are iconic along with the leaping jaguar hood mascot - from its Le Mans racing history, the words ""Jaguar"" and ""speed"" have become synonomous, and the beautiful cars feature styling like no other - they also carry a reputation for having snooty drivers, but the repuation is half of the fun - they are ultra smooth with fantastic rides and perhaps the epitome of refinement. The A8 and Audi, however, are still developing a meaning as I'll call it, and while Audi has gotten a pretty good connotation, ""A8"" is not as widespread as ""7-Series"", ""S-Class"", or ""XJ."" Maybe this will be the A8 to solidify its name into widespread fame and acclaim; it seems like it is off to a good start."
2192,"June 25, 2003 5:14AM",merc1,"See post #2288, I posted some some of the ending comments from that comparison. The A8 did win. They called the Jag a better car than the BMW. High praise indeed. If it wasn't for that dangone Phaeton I think the A8 could really hit the big time here now.

M"
2193,"June 25, 2003 5:22AM",jagboyxtype,"I think if word gets out about the A8 enough, it will get the sales it deserves. Phaeton is a great car, but it is also a Volkswagen - a ""peoples' car"" - and in this class, people do buy into the image of the car as well as its tangible traits. Audi is already upscale, so the A8 does not face the battle the Phaeton faces of becoming recognized as a real luxury car. But as I said, the competition has solid names already, and this A8 will have to fight to secure its own name among them, as I don't feel the previous one - however marvelous it may have been - was successful, or as successful as Audi would have wanted it to be, at doing that. This one is beautiful and engineered right, so it just may be the A8 that gets the recognition it deserves."

2197,"June 27, 2003 10:13PM",dwongswong,"Hi everyone! I'm new to the luxury car board. I recently got an Audi A6 in February. Since then, I've already put close to 11,000 miles on it. I really like the way it drives--comfortable, fast enough for me, like the way it looks, and feels safe with the quattro. I've owned three BMW's before I finally got the Audi (a friend advised me to get one). Though I did research on it and found out that it had many, many bad reviews on the Audi board, I went ahead and purchased it after seeing it in person.

The three BMW's that I owned (I still have a 2000 model), all have had numerous problems with them. The first was a '94 525i. I spent an extra $11,000 on the car fixing it after the car overheated and killed the engine. Plus, the glass fog lights kept breaking every few months whenever a small rock hit it. The second was a '00 323Ci. I had to replace the speakers, amplifier, wood trimmings, instrument cluster, outside temperature gauge and door moldings (twice). The 2000 328Ci that my wife drives has had the VANOS intake system, wood trimmings, and door moldings (twice also) replaced. The only reason I haven't traded it in is because my wife likes the way it looks and likes to drive cars until it is at least five years old. A BMW specialist told me recently that BMW's are not made to be owned more than 60,000 miles. They are sprinters; not marathon cars like Japanese vehicles.

I've been following the news about the 2004 Audi A8 L every since I first saw it at Autoweek.com. It's the best luxury sedan I have ever seen. I even sent AudiUsa.com an e-mail telling them how in love I was with it when I saw it. I wish that I could afford one, but not in this economy right now. Maybe someday.

For those of you who don't like Japanese luxury cars, I tell you this--no car, in general, will last as long and as easy to maintain as the Japanese brands. Many of my relatives and friends own them, and they all have never had any complaints about them. They may not look as good or drive as nice as the Germans, but they are fine cars if you intend to keep them for several years.

If there are any owners out there who like or dislike their luxury cars, please post on this board or e-mail me at dwongswong@yahoo.com telling me the likes and dislike about these fine cars. I want to know so that I can have an idea about what luxury car I want to get next. Also, if there is anyone who just got the 2004 A8, please let me know about your experience.

Thank you! And as always, drive safely out there."

2200,"June 30, 2003 12:39AM",merc1,"I would like to pose the question to the room. How much hp is enough?

All the Euro luxury carmakers: Mercedes, BMW, Audi, VW, Jaguar, and Bentley are all pushing hp to levels that are just short of ridiculous. We won't even go into what Bugatti, Ferrari, Porsche and the like are up to.

Mercedes has 4 600+ hp cars coming in the next 12 months: SLR, CL65, SL65 and the S65. They already have SEVEN cars that produce nearly 500hp as it is!

BMW is preparing a 550hp V10 for the next M5 and their 760Li already produces over 400hp.

VW is working on a ""R"" Variant of the Phaeton with 600hp.

http://www.thecarconnection.com/?article=6164&n=156,178&s- - - - - id=178

Audi will no doubt have to produce another S8 or an even more potent RS8. The current RS6 has 450hp.

Bentley's new Continental GT has about 550 hp.

Cadillac has what is sure to be a performance bargain coming the 50K 400hp CTS-v.

Jaguar has a few cars (XKR, S-Type R, XJR) with around 400hp too.

The Maybach and Rolls Phantom wear their high-hp engines with pride.

I remember when 300hp was awesome (about 10 years ago) for a luxury car and 400hp was truly reserved for exotic sports cars and a handful of sedans, now ordinary ""luxury"" cars are carrying this much hp and more. Where will it all end?

The Benz is the colder more efficient one, the Jag the warmer sensual one. I would say drive both and then decide. Normally I'd hands-down say Benz all the way, but this new XJ is a stunner, and its the first Jaguar since I've been paying attention to cars that actually stays with the Germans on technical, detail engineering. The Jaguar I think is also bigger inside. Tough choice.

Who was this ""specialist?"" The service writer at the Audi dealership? Sorry, but I know of too many very high mileage (>250k) daily driven Bimmers to believe that statement. In particular, the E30 3-series and the E28 and E34 5-series are known to be very hardy specimens. My '89 325is has only 160k, so we'll see how it holds up when it gets old. From the experiences of my friends who have owned them, I'd be less sanguine about the chances of an Audi making it that far."

Of course they can be kept for more than this, anything can, it's just a matter of how deep your pockets are and how busy your mechanic is. <wink>"
2207,"July 2, 2003 4:41PM",msgreen,"whomever said that BMWs aren't meant to be owned past 60K miles was either having a good time pulling someone's leg, or is full of it. Boredom is what causes most cars to be traded (gotta have the latest model), and sometimes reliability. Anybody buying a BMW as opposed to some other high-end marque has probably considered their sportiness and driving excellence. Few drivers get bored in BMWs - and they are as reliable as their owners want them to be (maintenance, etc). My 97 528 has 92K miles on it, looks and runs great, burns no oil and has had only ""normal maintenance"" done to it for seven years. Thousands more could tell similar stories (as could the owners of other makes)."
2208,"July 2, 2003 7:09PM",dwongswong,"Your BMW may have high mileage on it, but I'm sure that there are high mileage vehicles in all car categories. My overall experience with BMW cars was very bad--as well as my sister and friends. We all have had many problems with them during and after the warranty expired. I had three BMW's; my sister had one; my college friend had two; my professor had one; and my boss had one. Base on talking with them, we all came to the conclusion that BMW's are great cars to drive, but terrible cars to own out of warranty. All of us had to pay too much extra money to fix the cars' numerous problems after the warranty ran out. I alone had to pay more than $16,000 to keep the three BMW's I had running. I kept my '94 525i until 1999; my '00 323ci until '03; and still got my '00 328ci. My wife and I drove a lot, so our cars ran out of warranty within two years.

The BMW specialist works at my local dealership. He's been with them 11 years. He told me that BMW's are made to drive fast, fun and sporty. But as far as keeping them out of warranty, he would not own one. He told me to always buy an extended warranty when I get a new BMW, because they usually have problems once they reach 60,000 miles. He said that's why he would never own one unless he was rich. Also, look in Consumer Reports Used Cars Guide. BMW's don't have good reliability scores. Most are average, and some are even below average.

2215,"July 8, 2003 2:56PM",airmatic,"I'm curious to know what you didn't like about the Audi and what you did like about the 7-Series. They also had the uber-VW there too??&#148;

I was hoping that Audi would &#147;drastically redesign&#148; the flagship A8L. The front looks essentially the same (has the same general shape; same with the grille), the side looks well not that exciting. As for the rear, I don&#146;t know what to say. It just doesn&#146;t look the same to me as when the 2000 S-Class came out and when the controversial 7-series came out in 2002.

Now as for the 745Li
I just think that overall, it has the best design. Outside- the front truly does look like an eagle, with the &#147;eyebrows&#148; in the headlamps. The wide kidney grille looks majestic. But for me, and most beautiful aspect of the vehicle is the side-profile view. The shape, and lines, and chrome trim (I particularly enjoy viewing the rear doors on the Li model, with that opera window). Now, I must confess that the rear of the 7 is indeed strange, but sometimes, we have to accept different ideas, whether for the good or the bad.

Another part of the car that I love is the interior and performance. The inside looks like the interior of an airplane- the ways things are laid out the only negative issue I have with the interior design is the position of the iDrive display, as I believe it reduces visibility. Ah yes iDrive, another issue. I must say that even this system is more complicated than my MB S430&#146;s COMMAND system. But, as we have already seen, Audi&#146;s MMI technology (incorporated in the new A8L) is basically based on it (I don&#146;t buy it when people deny that). Hey, this isn&#146;t the first time a new idea was widely rejected- I remember clearly when Acura (I believe) introduced the moon-roof, a feature that the Germans didn&#146;t seem to understand nor appreciate. Nowadays, almost every car, from Honda to Maybach, offers or features a moonroof. Now, enough of moonroof.

Now I am certainly not saying that MB builds bad cars like the S-Class. Of course, you really can&#146;t get any better than a S (not counting Maybach, Rolls Royce, Bently). A Mercedes will always be a Mercedes, and I really believe that is why Mercedes has such a high repeat-customer rate. Mercedes will always be first, and BMW, Audi, and Lexus will never pass MB.

As for the VW Phaeton, it will not be at the motortrend event; only the S500, 745Li, and A8L.

By the way, I went to my local VW dealership to view the new SUV, the Toureg, as well as any info regarding the phaeton. Apparently, he was new and had no idea about the Phaeton (but did know a lot about the Toureg). The Toureg was really beautiful, with striking resemblance to the Porsche Cayenne.

In my opinion, I don&#146;t know who on earth would buy a VW at that high of a price. I may as well get a MB, BMW, Lexus, Infiniti, or Audi. The rear looks absolutely hideous in my opinion. I just don&#146;t understand how are they going to sell this product?

My best friend just got a 2003 SL55 AMG and a 2003 S500 4Matic together! He loves them, and is currently at a MB-hosted private Golf-event for patrons who purchase 2-or-more MB&#146;s at one time. He called during the party and said that there was an Iranian doctor who bought 8 MB&#146;s all at once! (gee, even in this economy!)

merc1- now I would like to know your opinion on the new Audi A8L (you say very close to the S-Class), and why you included the Jag and the Infiniti Q45 (i really don't understand the design team of the XJ, and i figure at the same price, you can get a much better car; LS430)

P.S.- you guys should check out this article on cnn.com/money about reliability (yes, the Japanese are still the best when it comes to reliability, I guess:

2216,"July 8, 2003 6:36PM",ljflx,"Car and Driver did not speak all that highly of the new A8. In fact much of their story was negative. While they were at it they trashed the styling of the old A8 (as an appliance on wheels; by the way I thought the old car was a good lookin car so I'm not on the same page as these guys) and made sure everyone knew about Audi's moribund sales of the A8. They said the looks were improved over the old design but never said they were good - unless I missed it.

Personally - the A8's new style has grown on me though I'm not crazy about its' rear. But from the side and front it's a great looking car.

Now you know how I feel about these mags but I do take the individual car write-ups much more seriously. The only disconcerting thing I took from the story was that the car had a rough harsh ride - something no high end lux family car should have.

As for looks - they also reported on the BMW 5 series and thought the new design was somewhere between bold and beautiful. Amazing. I'm not even in the same chapter as these people - let alone on the same page. Bangle is a one man wrecking crew. I hope he doesn't wreck the 330CCI. That's the one BMW I really like and would consider buying - rather seriously.

Lastly - it was clear they were looking for negatives on the A8 and only positives on the 5 series. These guys are quite biased in my opinion."
2217,"July 8, 2003 10:22PM",merc1,"Thanks for the evaluation and info.

Well as you know I'm blinded by the star, but I really love Audis too. I haven't been inside the A8 yet, just took a look at one on the dealer's lot on a Sunday. I'm drawn to if first by it's styling inside and out, then by it's engineering. I do find it to be disappointing that it isn't any lighter than any of the other cars in the class anymore. The S500 4Matic is actually a few pounds lighter and really shows up Audi's claimed advantage by using the expensive stuff. I'll have more on the A8 when I actually get to sit in one, or drive it if I'm lucky.

You have a friend that just bought a SL55 and S500 at the same time! Gee whiz. You guys just don't know how blessed you are to be able to do something like that, my other friend on this board has 3 Lexues, count them three. I can only imagine. A private party for people who buy 2 or more MB's at once huh...sounds very nice.

The VW SUV, truth be told totally shames the ML, of which I never, ever liked. I'll be so glad when it's replaced. I can see paying that much for the VW because it shares it's very being and most of it's engineering with a Porsche, a company that could be said to have even loftier engineering standards than VW. I think it will be a hit.

ljflx,

Hey, I was just talking about you! Anyway, I think they stated that the A8 they had was suffering from some type of glitch, concerning it's ride/suspension. I hope that was the case. I can't imagine such an awesome car being let down by a bad/nervous ride, as they indicated. The A8 just had it's best month ever in the U.S. for June, with 443 units sold.

Now it's no secret that Car and Driver is biased when it comes to BMW, and Honda. I can point out numerous examples, so I just tend to take their writeups of certain cars with a grain of salt.

Now for the 300K question...what did you think of their writeup on the Maybach? Also checkout Automobiles writeup on the ""Bach"" this month also, both magazines are saying the same thing....this is the best riding car in the world and probably the best car in the world period. They both mention my sole problem with the Maybach, it's styling. I too wish it were a little more seperated from the S-Class on the inside also. There were 13 Maybachs sold in June in the U.S. and Rolls has had to up production to 3 cars a week, so I guess somebody still has some money.

BMW's new styling direction hasn't failed them so far, with the new 7 selling far better than the old car ever did. The 5 doesn't look quite as bad so we'll just have to see. The new styling theme does work on the little Z4 roadster though, it's quite handsome. So maybe they're on to something???

By the way - whether you like it or not - the SC430 is a great car, fun to drive and very high end luxury. I just drove it again a week ago. I don't know what the heck I'm doing in 2004 when my leases are up. I'd like to try that Audi A8 but have no faith in its' reliability and if it doesn't ride smooth (the old one lacks the quality ride of an S or LS) it definitely has no chance. But I'll test drive it. I've got to have two AWD's and my wife is in love with RX but I must have 3 rows of seats. The new GX is nice but its not in the same league as the LX and I like the latters looks much more. But she hates driving such a large SUV. I started to think RX, A8 (but believe me it's nearly impossible for me to walk from the LS and the only other car that really grabs me is the S-500) and SC430. I wish they'd put AWD on the LS. Odds on favorites right now are RX, LX and LS (outside shot for SC - but it's not all that practical) - but I've got plenty of time to figure it out.

By the way its not unusual to see all Lexus or all MB's in a family's garage. The loyalty to both brands is very high.

Anyway I'm off on a much needed vacation - see you in a few weeks."
2220,"July 9, 2003 6:12PM",islamorada,"Just completed a long weekend of test driving the set and wondered if any of you may have noticed the same things.

The 745 - great ride, fun to drive, not a bangle fan (like hiding a great car in a very odd suit), thank goodness for voice commands (although it seems like great training to talk to yourself)

The A8L - much easier to get the hang of the electronics than the 745, had a wobble to the ride (best described by our 5 year old as ""jello on a rock"" - tight feeling in the action but finished out with a rocking motion), greatest level of toys for the bucks

S430 - solid, classic, lost to the BMW in the sort of ride quality I as looking for (sometime described as athletic)

Touareg - actually very surprised by the ride and capabilities of the new VW. Why buy a cayenne other than the fun of porsche/audi dealerships?

Gotta try some others to figure out where the vehicle selection will end up."
2221,"July 9, 2003 9:57PM",merc1,"Well I'll tell you, the Q45 is a confused car. Is it a sports sedan or a full on luxury crusier? They marketed it as a sports sedan, of which it isn't. The only truly ""sporty"" sedans of that size are the S55, 745i (w/Sport package), S8 and XJR, and it doesn't come close to beating any of those cars. Now since it's priced similar to a 540i does it compete with it? Not even. To confuse matters more the M45 is here now and it's being marketed as s sports sedan. The Q45 is a left out of today's market, mainly by Infiniti's botched marketing of the car. It should have played the role as a luxury car first, sporty car second. It doesn't match the luxury of a S-Class or LS430, and isn't as sporty as say the 7-Series...so it's just like forgotten by most buyers.

The car itself is very good on the inside, but it's styling it unbalanced in my eyes. Way too much front and rear overhangs for me. The S-Class is the only car that manages to pull that off gracefully, especially in the rear.

For the first time I think I'm truly head-over-wheels for a Jaguar, this new XJ. What a car. Best of all it's very technical and functional, thus being able to truly compete with the usual German and Japanese cars by offering just more than styling/wood/leather. Job well done. Now bring back the XJ12!

No doubt about it for me, if there was no S-Class, the A8 would be next in line.

ljflx,

I'm curious to know if you know anyone with a Maybach yet? Yes the styling isn't the car's strongest suit, I feared that since day one.

I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on the SC430, it's just a 2-door sedan by all account, it doesn't enough driving excitement for for 2-door car posing as a GT car. I should never, ever see or hear the word Buick when talking about a GT car. If I were you I'd try at least one German car for 2004, either the A8, S500 (try a sport or 4Matic model) or SL500 and keep two Lexuses. The A8 C&D tested was suffering from a glitch, so I'd wait to see what others say before writing it off after one roadtest.

Enjoy your vacation!

2227,"July 10, 2003 2:42PM",fenn,"Hello. I just came back to Town Hall, as I am in the market for a new car in the upscale sedan class. I am considering the 2004 Audi A8, and the 2004 Jaguar XJ8 at this point. I think that I have eliminated the 745i and MB E500...although I am still in my formative stages of this decision.

I am one of the few folks that currently owns a 2002 Infiniti Q45, which has been a great car, but it is approaching 50,000 miles, and I want to get out of it in the next few months. I like this car, but I am not going to get another one. To be candid, I might have gone back if they had updated and tweaked the car a bit, but Infiniti has chosen to let the Q45 stand as-is, and they are not going to do anything with the 2004 model. By the way. if anybody wants my thoughts about the Q45, I am happy to oblige. It really is a nice car for $50,000...although the resale is a bomb.

I was awaiting the arrival of the 2004 Audi A-8 anxiously, ever since seeing the exterior at the L.A. auto show this year. In person, I have to say that the car looks very good to me ---both inside and out. No disappointment for me. I test drove one, and had little complaint about the so-called busy or jiggly ride that Car and Driver and others have mentioned. In fact, it felt almost too luxo-smooth. The acceleration is decent, but it is not a scorcher. My 2002 Q45 feels a bit quicker....but they are in the same ballpark. I liked the interior look and the switchgear, controls and technology.

My problem with the Audi is the 70k plus, price tag. It may be worthy of this due to it's comparative quality and content, but I worry how the car will hold its value. I have a friend that got hit hard on the resale of his older generation 2001 A-8. As a high mileage driver I am forced to buy, rather than lease, and until I see that the new A-8 is more highly prized on the used car market, I worry about spending that much money on an A8 that I may trade out of in 2.5 to 3 years.

I also looked at the new 2004 XJ8. I was never a Jaguar fan and never considered this as an option in it's prior generation. I was very pleasantly surprised by the new Jaguar. It was comfortable, and felt great to drive. I also think that it is a decent value in this segment at about 60k without navigation.

I had considered looking at the MB E500, but I just borrowed my brother-in-law's new E320, and was not impressed by the space and feel of the car. The V8 in the E Class may be great, but I like the larger cars.

The BMW 745 is a great car, but I am just another of the many who cannot get over the ungainly rear end of this car. I have tried to talk myself into liking it, but every time I look at one from the rear I say to myself ""what were they thinking?""

I am scheduled to do the S-Class A-8, 745i Motor Trend test drive this month in L.A. more later."
2228,"July 10, 2003 2:53PM",fenn,"I have owned many Q45's..although I will be jumping ship soon, as per my previous post...

To answer your question, the Q45's from 2000 to 2001 are nice, solid, comfortable cars. Not exciting, or highly inspirational, but they have good build quality and decent performance. Beware of small trunk and smallish back seat leg room. They are nice, dependable cars for the price....If you can get one with low miles that had a couple of years left on the factory warranty, it is a really good choice."

The Audi has a much lower center console and some real designer touches to it, the LS430's (imo) interior is just a Avalon x3, lots quality, but not much style, especially with that gaping whole for the Nav screen.

2230,"July 10, 2003 11:25PM",merc1,"Hadn't read your post earlier. The Audi A8 isn't going to ever match the S-Class for resale, but it's getting better, and should be somewhere near the 7-Series. Car and Driver's test car was suffering from a glitch as far as it's ride was concerned. I think it's a wonderful car and second only to the S-Class in my book. Look at the A8's price as being a bargain compared to a S500, which can be had with awd and even more features, but for a whole lot more $$$$.

The Jaguar is much improved, also liked. The 7-Series by all accounts is a fabulous car as long as you don't have to look at or try to operate (the controls) it.

Autoweek just released their ""best"" issue, determined by subscribers (like me). The S-Class won followed by the A8, just as I would have voted.

2232,"July 11, 2003 6:54AM",fsv,"Don, thank you. I was and am still thinking about buying a used Q45 with lower mileage, 'cuz I think, that the quality of Q45, LS430 or Acura RL doesn't deterriorate so quickly, but the price goes down, and in Q's case - dramatically, what makes it a particularly good buy for people like me - I put on a lot of miles, and can not drive econoboxes - I am getting too tired from noise, vibration, etc - & I don't care how much gas it burns. And 01 car looks like a particularly good buy. Of course there is '02, whaich comes out of lease now, it looks better, is stronger and more sophisticated, but it is what - 10G's more? And I am afraid it will have problems same as early 90th Q's had - too much power was biting on reliability (though a lot depends on how the car was driven). Of course, if a good '02 Q for a reasonable amount of money crosses my path, I'll go for it. Does anybody know - preferably from personal experience, what are trade-in prices for '02 cars with around 30K's mileage? I've heard it like in low $30th. Is it true? And what things should I look out buying a Q?"
2233,"July 11, 2003 7:42AM",cheezhed,"I looked this car over quite thoroughly. As with all Audis the interior as with Lexus, is probably the nicest in the business. The car handles very well although not a rocket. The problem is simply: overpriced and poor relative resale. Like Q45's it would represent a great opportunity on a used basis, eventually."
2234,"July 11, 2003 9:18AM",fsv,"though my interest is Q and I definitely don't want for discussion to branch out - Audi's stylin' is too flashy, and quality ""lasst viel mehr uebrig wuenschen"" - in other words, not even close to LIA (Lexus/Infiniti?Acura). This is the reason Audi's depriciate so much, nothing else. They are excellent cars, the way I see it, with great dynamic, handling, really nicest (IMHO) interiors in the business, but they style them like Civics. Cheaper cars should dramatically change it's appearance every year, not $70,000 cruisers. That's why I am attracted to Infiniies - looks the same for longer time. Same thing do Lexus and Acura. Europeans recently go wild - A.m. Audi changes looks of the car every half a year, BMW recently is nothing short of controversial inside out (I was in 745 a week ago - didn't know where to start from, what to touch, etc), MB's look plain strange - too italian, and too sweet. Obviously, it is tough competition between them in Europe - but most of their cars are sold here - so, why do they do that?
Also, IMHO, the new Dodge/Chrysler cars look promising - Magnum, and C300 - if I could get one of them for low $30th, I will buy one - a new car is a new car, and definitely they will not depriciate as bad as a brand new Q45 - different class, different customers. Domestic brands are getting very sophisticated now - look at Caddy - it will be wrong to discount them - again, in my opinion, which could be wrong or right."
2235,"July 11, 2003 10:58AM",fenn,"I can tell you that my 2002 Infiniti has been relatively bullet proof, with the exception of the driver's power seat mechanism, and some repair bulletins. The resale is quite atrocious, so you might find a bargain if you keep your eyes open for a used one over the next several months. FYI, I got a prelim trade in quote on my high mileage (49,000) 2002 Q45 at about $26,500...that hurts. I may try to sell it myself at about 30k---- if that looks feasible.

I previously had a '99 Q45T, which is the same generation as the 2000 and 2001's that you are considering, but the T had the sport adjustable suspension. As I mentioned in my earlier post, it was trouble free and comfortable. If you can buy one in the low to mid 20's it is a good buy, and you will be at the advantageous end of the the Q45's unfortunate depreciation history....."
2236,"July 11, 2003 11:42AM",sysadb,"Don, the resale on the current model has been better than the previous generation. (although marginal) The milage is killing yours. At the other extreme, I saw an 02 on eBay 2 months ago that was bid up to over $46k and still did not meet the dealer's reserve. It had all the options and only had 5k miles, which put it at the highest end of the resale scale. Still...I figure the car originally listed for about $59k and could be bought at aroung $55k, so if someone was willing to pay over $46k for a 1.5 year old copy that's pretty good compared to previous models.

BTW, the design is only two years old. Why do you feel they should change it for 04? I thought they addressed two big items in 03 when they moved the CD changer out of the glovebox and changed the shift points to take more advantage of the engine. Don't see much else they need to do...

2237,"July 11, 2003 12:31PM",fsv,"Q45 - it looks like the worst competition to Q45/M45 is standing next to them in the Infiniti own dealerships and is called FX35 and FX45 - they are flying off the shelf like hot pancakes. It is amazing to see, that G35 (esp the coupe) and both FX's are nonnegotiable on the price and Q/M45 are sold at 5-7G's discount. Allegedly 3 years old Lexus 430 is of better quality than any other car sold new; I don't think there is any difference quality between 430 and Q45 3 years old; this way, you can have a much better car, ""barely broken in"" (as Toyota says selling it's precertified cars) for much lesser price than G35.
Don, of course you should try to get more money for your car - but here, in NY/Tristate area 2-3 years old Q45 with under 30,000 miles sell for under 20G's - $18,000 is considered really not bad on a trade-in, that's why I am going for it..."

For cosmetics,, I would have hoped that they might have tweaked or reworked the Q45's grill, trim, etc. and come our with new wheel options as a minimum. A bit of added HP and performance would have been nice too. By contrast, for 2004 they are adding options and content to the Q45's ugly step child, the M45, to give it more of the Q45 virtues.

They are without a doubt the worst website for automotive information. Do you ever notice how their ""inside"" is usually info already known to everyone, and/or it's already in print in a real publication like Autoweek. Autoweek can't be topped for prompt and accurate news delivery, autospies is garbage. Some examples:

""The SL55 is being canceled for 2004"".....they even posted a made up lie about a customer that said: ""When I tried to place an order for a 2004 SL55 I was rejected and was told I could put a deposit down on a SL65, which per my salesman replaces the SL55 for 2004"". Not! The SL65 hasn't even been officially announced yet, better still Mercedes would never, ever cancel such a car in it's SECOND model year. Absurdish rubbish.

The SL is getting a cloth top for 2004. This is even more absurd than the above.

I find it rather pathetic of them to post what C&D said and then agree with it, knowing they've never driven the car.

You owe it to yourself to drive the A8 before writing it off. Car and Driver's test car appears to have been suffering from a software glitch concerning it's suspension. The rest of their article really didn't say anything bad about the car, they more or less weren't ""wowed"" by the car. They mainly harped about four things"" 0-60 times, styling, ride and it not being the lightest car in the class. That last point I somewhat understand because it's actually heavier than at least one of it's competitors (S500 4Matic), so that kinda makes one question why they should put up with buying an aluminum car if it isn't lighter than the rest, by a significant margin. The Jaguar XJ shows a clear weight advantage by using aluminum. However the A8's styling and ride are both very debatable, especially since their car was suffering from a glitch. It's 0-60 times are a little behind the S500 and 745i, but it's still within the class, so I don't see the big deal there either. I guess by now you realize I really like this car.

although it a beautiful sedan, it just doesn't meet my expectations, in terms of styling and creativity. they really could have made more bold and interesting design, but i guess they decided to ""play it safe"" and be more conservative. even the Lexus LS430 looks just as uninteresting and boring as the A8L, in my opinion.

I find the A8 to be clean looking and sleek for a big car. IMHO, much more so than the current LS 430, which Lexus is going to update a bit in the fall.

I have driven the A8 a couple of times, and really like it. It is not a thrill ride, but it is a great driving vehicle for a big luxury car. I am also ""wowed"" by the interior, which is where I am going to be sitting most of the time.....

M45 is pointles; as opposite to any well executed car that makes a statement as the benchmark in styling, handling, performance & engineering sophistication. M45 is, may be, not a bad car by itself, wouldn't be out there and prior to it's existance Q45; in this situation, with Q45 being so poorly advertised and undermarketed, a car, that has the same size, same engine, same performance, nearly the same interior, and pricetag nearly 20G's lower (in real sales prices) + the car is plain ugly + still lagging behind against it's competition such as BMW540, Audi A6, Lexus GS400 is pointless. You have one excellent car, that is still a lame duck in sales, and now you put on sales floor nearly the same thing - which sells even worse, but competes with your own struggling flagship... And you have to discount this car nearly 20% - it is a killer for the image of a luxury brand. Situation is not like BMW745/BMW545 (or is it 540?) - same engine which is adequate on the bigger car makes smaller car speed demon. It is simply very awkward situation. The only good variable here is that C. Ghosh is still running Nissan, and this situation hopefully will not last long, and he'll straighten it out. M45 is not more than a placeholder for the market segment (I believe it is built on the japanise Sima platform(hope this is correct name), and Q45 in the current form will not last long, and previous gen. Maxima fate is awaiting them - soon better cars will replace though good, but uninspiring current cars. And, we should hand it to Ghosh - look at the parade of Altima, G35, Maxima, coming Titan, Murano. It's not a big deal, to make a mistake, as long as it is corrected promptly.

As for the M45, there is no doubt that this was not a long term development project. It was a ""quickie"" new model based on an existing chassis and components. It is a price leader in its class for the HP that it offers....... It is a decent car that has a very nice big V8 engine, at a good price.

Yes, Libertycat, you can compare an M45 to a Q45 as a comparison of two different model classes, much like a GS series vs LS series Lexus... However, both Lexus models underwent their own independent development and evolution. The M45 is more of a late comer, built from the Nissan/Infiniti parts bin. It has a Q45 engine and dash put into a 5 year old Nissan chassis. The car had to live with the limitations of the body size and chassis, so interior is cramped, and the trunk is small.....I am not really trying to knock the M45. I am just saying that it is not ""the state of the art"" car that Infiniti needs in this class. Worse yet, putting so much of the Q45's good stuff in a cheaper car only hurts the current Q45.

When the ""new"" Infiniti comes out with the 2005-2006 replacements for the Q45 and M45, I am betting that you will see some fresh ideas and innovation."

I disagree that with this simplistic stance, using sales as the determining factor. (Merc1, based on sales figures, your Mitsubishi is not a very strong car either, but I assume that you like it)

The Q45 does offer many similar attributes to other cars. They may have missed on the styling and curb appeal, but it is a very nice car with lots of content and a nice power train. On a lease basis it is ""a nice drive""... and it does offer similarities to some of the more costly cars in this class.

2269,"July 16, 2003 12:28PM",jagboyxtype,"Some people don't care for the Q's styling, with the ""gatling gun headlights"" and all of those comments, but I find the car to be very attractive inside and out, and intriguing. I've only driven one in relatively a relatively short drive, but it seems up to the standards of its competitors in most respects. My personal preferences in areas such as performance, technology, styling, and ride, etc. still make the XJ tops in my opinion for this class, but the Q45 is one great car too. I honestly think the Q's a good looking, classy car. I don't care for the M's styling so much, but that's just me, and I haven't driven it yet, so it may surprise me - I don't dislike it at all though.

DonFenn-

I agree with you on your view of the ""simplistic stance"". If sales were a determining factor in telling how great a car is, then all of those Camry and Corolla buyers must be seeing something that we're not. The Q just suffers from being a less-well-known offering in a market with well established and not necessarily better competiton. I don't know about others here, but the first few names that pop into *my* head when I think ""high-end luxury"" for a nano-second are Mercedes and Jaguar. Further thought then leads to BMW, Lexus, Audi,.......... Infiniti. The Q just doesn't have its name thrown around so much that the public knows about it, but that doesn't make it an underperformer in any way compared to the competition in terms of the car you get. And what it lacks in sales, it gains back in exclusivity and uniqueness; it's not being another ""cookie-cutter"" overly mass-produced so-called ""luxury"" car that is used as a taxi cab in Germany.

Merc1-

But, generally, I should say, Caddy churns out more and more attractive cars. A while ago I nearly fell for DTS...

On Q45 styling - it may use some work, of course, but what would work greatly for this car, would be slightly stretched version of the car, like Audi has slightly longer A8. And, visually it would be more appealing. And in general, they could make it slightly roomier inside. Same, as they did to Maxima - same engine, bigger car; not only people who are loyalist went after it, but the guys who would normally go for other brands switched to it.

2278,"July 16, 2003 1:35PM",fenn,"It is nice to see that there are Q45 supporters here.

Unfortunately, for whatever reason, Infiniti has stopped any significant effort in marketing the car, and passed on any tweaks or updates of significance for the 2004 model year...Meanwhile, Lexus is giving an update to the LS430 and BMW is going to clean up the rear fascia of the 7 series. Both of these models were unveiled within about 6 months of the current Q45, and they are still getting some freshening for 2004 ....Why not the Q45?

Infiniti is just leaving the Q45 as-is with a new color option and a minor transmission shift modification. It is as if they just gave up on this Q45..That is why I am looking elsewhere for my next car.

With respect to the Q45's size...The interior is spacious from the driver's seat. I am 6'3"" and I find my seating very ample. The problem is that the backseat is relatively cramped."
2279,"July 16, 2003 1:45PM",libertycat,"The LS430 was on sale in 2000, a whole year before the Q45 and the 7 Series was getting so much criticism about its styling that BMW had to restyle it."

Again, current Nissan management looks very capable and I don't think they will abandon the segment. I suspect, there is something going on in Infiniti's design kitchen - and so far, with the new French chef they've got, the dishes come out very tasty. Let's just wait."
2281,"July 16, 2003 2:02PM",fenn,"Well, the word from my source at Infiniti is that they are just now designing and formulating what will happen for the 2006 year (with a debut in mid-2005). From what I understand, there are no plans to do anything with the current car until then....That certainly shows a bit of Infiniti's apathy towards the car...

By the way, I was told that they may even drop the Q45 model designation and come out with a totally new model designation for the Infiniti flagship."
2282,"July 16, 2003 2:28PM",fsv,"Design of any car is expensive; design of a flagship is even more costly, especially if the prior one was a flop. Return on a successful 60G's car can be tremendous, just ask Lexus - but this is not the experience Infinity can relate to, that's why it is understandable. ROI, if you know what I mean. But, they will warm up to it, they just need to star believing in themselves again. They should show same practical approach they had to G35. And, may be, show me the car prior to final stages of design - so far I was never wrong, predicting a car's fate.
I would think twice prior to killing Q45 nameplate - not a single person I know has ever gave any negative comments regarding this car. Moreover, lack of Infiniti's attention to the car and extremely poor marketing is what stops people from continuing ownership of Q45."
2283,"July 16, 2003 10:01PM",merc1,"I think you missunderstood me about the Q45, it's a good car, and I happen to actually like it, especially more than it's cross-town rival. But to say it's %95 of what you'll get with an S-Class or 7-Series is a little too far fetched. Sales while not a end-all determining factor, they do gauge what people think about the car *to a degree*. My point was that this car if it was so close to being an S-Class or 7-Series the word would have gotten out now, and it wouldn't be dead in the water in only it's 2nd model year. The Q45 doesn't have the ride/handling mix of those cars. It doesn't ride as smoothly as the S and it can't hope to match the 7-Series for sportiness. The Q surely isn't ninety-five percent of the S-Class or 7-Series either when it comes to features, especially when talking about the S-Class. Styling is a personal thing, and to most the Q missed the boat. Nissan/Infiniti also tried to market the car as a sport sedan, of which it isn't, that helped kill it in the marketplace. They also bragged about it's hp and the car when initially tested wasn't no where near as fast as it should have been considering it had a 30-40hp advantage on the class, again at that time. The M45 surely didn't help matters either.

The Q just came out for the 02 model year, so thats why its not getting any refresh for 04, plus the car has been a sales dud, so it's hard for Nissan to justify the money for something like that.

Bottom line the Q45 is a good car, but when it comes to S, A8 and 7-Series territory being a ""good"" car doesn't cut it. It's about %70 percent of those cars, no where being %95. It's really a good car in search of proper marketing and some fine-tunning if they truly intend to position it as a S-Class, 7-Series or A8 alternative.

jagboyxtype,

Exclusiviity is a often-used excuse when a car doesn't sell well. If you were to say the Jag is exclusive I'd agree, they didn't go for volume in the first place, never really have with the XJ. Thats not Infiniti's case. So the S-Class is a cookie-cutter design because its used a taxicab in it's home country? You said that just to take a shot right old friend?

M"
2284,"July 16, 2003 10:08PM",libertycat,"IMO it is 100% of these cars for 25% less. It is not a ""sales dud"" as I see them ALL the time and the S Class is so common, I get tired of its styling. It does have the handling and power of the pitiful 7 and S."
2285,"July 16, 2003 10:15PM",merc1,"Well the industry says it isn't, nobody has ever compared the Q45 with the S or 7 favorably. If Infiniti says its been ""lackluster"" in sales then I'd go with what they'd say about it. No other car in recent memory has bombed as bad in only its second model year.

How you feel about a car and it's position in the market are two very different things. I feel the same way about the A8, but Audi has done it right for 2004, and it's sales should show this soon. The S and 7-Series are ""pitiful""? Ok.

M"

That is SO silly."

2288,"July 16, 2003 11:57PM",jagboyxtype,"Merc, I never mentioned the S-Class's name in that taxi statement - it's an old tired joke; BMW's and even Jaguars are used as taxis in Europe too, but Germany is the country known for using what Americans consider the highest mass-produced luxury (i.e. - not Rolls or Maybach, but the step below, which is this class) whether it be Benz, Jag, or Bimmer as taxis - there are also Jaguar police cars and I've seen Bimmer police cars too (both the X-type and 3-Series are used as high-speed interceptors) if that helps. I really didn't mean offense by it, nor was I trying to ""fire a shot"" at any particular brand so I hope you don't take it too personally. I really am sincere.

I think your own protective nature of your favorite brand has caused you to sometimes believe that people are trying to bash when they really aren't. I'm the same way, so we both need to cool down on it a bit with that. We've got to come to realize that these are only opinions, and what does it matter what someone says about a car - in this case, ""nothing"" is the answer and the key to being enlightened. Really, nothing more was meant by the comment than to say that the Q45's low sales do gain it more exclusivity - be it through not selling well or the company's own decision to make it a low volume car, it still ends up being more exclusive than its much faster selling competitors. It doesn't matter how it becomes exclusive - what matters is that it is exclusive.

So, we're old friends again now, old sport?

Here, as a tolken of good will, I offer this newfound review of the XJ.

http://www.detnews.com/2003/autosconsumer/0307/16/g03-218791.htm

Despite them liking the car, through my experience in reading their other works, *my opinion* (just in case you like them - really don't want to offend) of them is that they are pretty worthless writers. But sometimes they offer a few good bits, and here, they do offer some of the things I've been saying - like how the XJ is on a modified and lengthened S-type platform; the DEW98, which is still a Ford design, but strengthened with some bracing enough to keep rigidity when cast in aluminum. See, and you like this ""not-so real"" Jaguar! :-) <-see it!?"
2289,"July 17, 2003 12:10AM",merc1,"Of course we are, we never really ""fell-out"" as the saying goes. We just tend to not budge and disagree on our views about our brands of choice. There is only truly one person in all of Edmunds that irks me to the point of me actually getting me seriously annoyed with them, and that person rarely, if ever posts on any of the Sedans boards. I was right with you on the taxicab thingy, you know I hear that one a lot. That and the dump truck, garbage truck jabs, as Mercedes-Benz makes some of those also. The only thing I disagree about is the Q45 so-called exclusiveness, it's not exclusive by choice, like certain cars are. They're desperate to sell more of the, but can't. The A8 is in a similar boat, but just had it's best sales month ever so that may change for Audi. When Nissan gets around to their upper segment cars, or in other words the next Q and more importantly the M45 they'll have better success.

Well you know we can live/die by car reviewers. Most curse them when their view doesn't line up with their own. I'm guilty of that when it comes to BMW and Car and Driver, other than than I pretty much agree with them *most* of the time. There are exceptions. I do find Edmunds' first drives sometime suspect at times. Things ""like I couldn't fit my Arizona Ice-Tea in the cupholder"" have to be laughed at, imo.

As you know I'm a big fan of the new XJ, it's just what Jaguar needed in the premium segment. Is there any hope of another XJ12? I did read where there might be a long wheelbase version in a couple of years. I voted it ""World-Class"" on the site you linked, surprisingly %37 of the voters rated it as acceptable? I just don't see how anyone could come to that conclusion at all.

Perhaps in our differences of opinion, our similar attributes (dare I call us both stubborn - no, wrong, word, ""we both hold to our positions firmly"" - there we go) come through. And we both know tons about the respective marques that interest us the very most.

As far as people criticizing M-B for knowing how to make world class luxury cars and more utilitarian vehicles too, from a logical standpoint, the person badmouthing the marque because of that actually looks pretty stupid. Look, they know how to make ALL those different vehicles! OMG! - they make a dump truck - yeah, even Honda can't make one of those, and they advertize how they can make everything from an ATV to an NSX. It's just plain silly to criticize them for having the know-how to diversify; it's like picking on the nerd who scored a 1600 on his SAT's - ha! ha! - look who should really be laughing.

Despite what Libertycat says, the car is still a sales flop....I think that they only sold 156 Q45's in June for the U.S. I think that their sales target was at least three times that amount. So, the empirical proof is that they are not selling.

IMHO, think that they had a interim chance to do something before 2006, if they had reworked the controversial headlamps and front grill, put some larger wheel options, and tweaked the engine to get just a bit more performance (overseas versions of this engine have 360 hp.)...But they did not do anything.... They must have decided to just go to the drawing board to start work on the next generation.

As for the Q45's cache of having something exclusive or different... I like it. I enjoy being stealth-like in my Q. My business is in an inner-city, commercial industrial area, and I am much less conspicuous in my Q45 than I would be in a more recognized German car...... Some folks want the MB or BMW status symbol. I do not really car about that.

As a footnote, I also think that a nice car is not always determined by a popularity contest, ... nor does it mean that a slow seller is a bad car.

Also, I don't know why you call them ""controversial"", as the matter of fact everybody I know likes the gatlin gun lights. May be their total size and shape... But then again, the whole light is pretty much in style of the whole car.

DonFenn,

You stated: ""I also think that a nice car is not always determined by a popularity contest, ... nor
does it mean that a slow seller is a bad car.""

I agree completely. There are few ""good"" cars that for some reason or another weren't very popular: Volvo C70, Audi A8, BMW 8-Series and the current Q45. I think that Infiniti really botched the current Q45 chances with the previous Q45 or ""Q41"" as it should have been called. Now that was a car that went backwards in every way compared to the original Q. The 1997 Q was slower, smaller, worse looking, less powerful, and on top of all that I think it was more expensive.

Don, why do you think that only people in auto industry have sound judgement? If it were true, names such Cord & Pakkard would still exist along with Rolls Royce and Maybach, Chrysler wouldn't be silent in Daimler-Chrysler, and there wouldn't be an avalanche of bland, boring and sometimes plain idiotic cars from GM, Aztek being a crown to them all. I personally always felt, that new ideas, new people, new influences must have a chance. Otherwise it will be a stiff cast society, like in some oriental country 2000 years ago. Who told you that they are untoucheable royalty? Like in any business, they have more dead wood and ballast among them, than healthy young sprouts; and the companies are being mismanaged all right, producing not what they should and could, but just something. Following your logic, people like the same Ghosh, or Zora Arkus-Duntov or many other would never get a job - 'cuz they are not form ""the world's auto industry"".

2313,"July 18, 2003 12:46PM",fsv,"I never said, that I base my judgement on my previous profession. I said, it is perception of style, time and common sence. Also, a car is always more than style, it is a not finalized sum of constantly changin' variables. Regardless of occupation - why not? I'd say industry background here is more of a disadvantage - exactly 'cuz of it you find Toyota, Honda - pretty much everybody sending their design guys out to art exibitions, furniture show rooms, etc. - trying to find what's appealing to the targeted market group, what's trendy, what's cool OUTSIDE OF THE INDUSTRY. Though, in my opinion, as result even worse thing is happenig through that - young creative talents are being used for fact collection to be further on digested by corporative burocratic mashine - fruits of that - Lex IS300 is the proof, how you can flop doing that - exactly because it is the same approuch GM was using trying to build their car, making something for everybody - and, where is GM now? Though Toyota so far is doing not so bad with X-Box and rest of japanese young crowd cars they don't sell here yet.
To be able to offer something, one must have drive, it's own perception of the world and style, certain coolness and know the way to make people attracted to this look at the things around them translated into style of a particular car created for the particular purpose. There are few people in the industry - same Ghosh I named too often, Ferdinand Piech, may be Yakokka (hell, forgot how to spell his name) Lutz, though less so, May.
Some of you posts - like knowing the most recent sales numbers, mentioning ""my sources in Infiniti"", etc., make me think you that are an insider, or a dealer - am I correct?

FYI double6, I think it IS a worthy competitor of the XJ/7 Series. And I have already said that I like the XJ Type better than the Q45. But when you add in value, the Q45 comes pretty close to the XJ Series (which is cheaper than most in this class) on my list. Now, I would really, truly appreciate it if DonFenn, merc1, double6, and fsv would just accept my opinon and stop trashing a car they know little about obviously. Actually, I'm just curious too. Why don't you think the Q45 is up to competing with 7/S/XJ/etc? Because it is too cheap? Not selling well enough? Because it doesn't have a three pointed star or a cougar? Because it doesn't have iDrive, which every article I have read about has LOVED (hint, I'm being sarcastic)?"

The article goes to say that by offering customers new cars, Mercedes was steering clear of a complex retrofitting process, as well as trying to repair some dents to its quality image; and the cars that Mercedes takes back will be sold as used vehicles."
2333,"July 22, 2003 3:49PM",ljflx,"I test drove one today as I'm off this week. Ride is too harsh for such a luxury car and it is not all that quiet. The review in the magazine was right on the money. For Audi's sake I hope it's a first generation production problem. Interior is well designed and luxurious but overall I found the car disappointing because of the ride quality. Car handles very well but it is hardly a sports car. Yet the thumps over uneven road surfaces are more like a sports car. This car will not be a big hit with US luxury car buyers. It may sell 400-500 a month for the first few months than it'll drop back to its normal 200 a month level.

The Range Rover (drove it at the same place) is fabulous and is right there with the LX470. Flip a coin as to which is better. I'd actually lean a bit to the RR in luxury and to the LX in ride quality. But the RR rides great and the LX is also quite luxurious. Can't go wrong with either one.

Why would you be surprised I recommended an S500. I almost took one myself. It's a great car - but I don't have great confidence in its reliability vs. Lexus. The Lexus LS beats it in the things that matter most to me - but not by much. I have no doubt an S500 will be more reliable than an A8."

I noticed that Edmunds praised the ride, but their car didn't have the 19-inch wheels. I wonder if it's just the big-tire combo thats producing these complaints about the ride. Though I suspect none of these cars are going to ride as soft as a LS430. We'll just have to see about the sales. I suspect it will do better than the old car for quite a while.

So does your liking of the RR mean it may have a future in your garage?

I did register at NY Times website, and I did read two articles on the Maybach, if those are one of the ones you mean, or is there another one?

2336,"July 23, 2003 12:06AM",jagboyxtype,"I've got to agree with ljflx on the A8's ride for the most part. Took a look/drive this weekend and it was rather loud overall. It doesn't really like to glide over bumps, but the intruding thuds from the suspension and its rather unrefined manner for the price may be because the car (e.g. the very vehicle I tested) is new. When Jags - and I only use the example because they are what I know best - are brand new, their suspensions are a little more loud over bumps than one would expect if they've ever ridden in a Jaguar with some miles on it for comparison, but they quiet down and refine a lot after a few thousand miles and eventually really buffer out any road imperfections and bumps better than anything else that has any sort of sporty side to its personality to go along with the luxury side - mind you, I know this from much experience with various Jags all owned brand new from the dealer. But the A8 seemed excessively louder than even new off-the-lot Jags, and this was not too long after having just tested a new XJR, which has a harder suspension (and the newness thuds that come with it) anyway. A8 has a presence on the outside because of its massive size, and the interior is large but it - though executed quite well - like the A4's still left me feeling the design seemed older than what's now coming from Mercedes on its newest models or the updated traditional look from Jaguar. I don't believe the car I tested had the 19-inch wheels either, as the test car was different from the other one I scrutinized and I was unable or uninterested in looking at the tag on the one I drove. I left a bit disappointed, but I suspect it was because the suspension really hadn't had much prior use, and it may refine itself like the Jaguars' over a short period of being driven - I hope that's the case. Still a nice car."
2337,"July 23, 2003 8:51AM",johnnyboy4,Not so much with it's packages but with a few simple things. Drop the base price to 52k flat and have a single package for navigation. Sound too much like the RL. Consider the fact it always outsold the RL. The rear seat galor options are a little on the ridiculous side since they raise the price into Lexus range where many people will ditch the seats and go for the Lexus.
2338,"July 23, 2003 11:17AM",aramus,"I picked up my new 2003 Q 45 one week ago. I want to report that I am totally awed by the car. It is without question the finest car I have ever driven. It is much better in every respect then I thought it would be. I cannot believe that another car is superior in some meaningful aspect, one that a driver would actually feel.

I am also grateful to all other luxury car buyers who shun the Q 45. This has once again allowed me to lease this car at rates that are ridiculous when compared to the competition. My only conclusion to this phenomena is consumers inability to perceive the Q 45 for what it is. I believe the A 8 will fail for the same reason in the US market.

Back in the mid 80's I sold Jaguar cars. Before beginning this job I had never driven a Jaguar, but thought they were wonderful automobiles. During my first drive, my thinking changed. I thought the 1985 XJ6 was a terrible car in almost every respect. But boy did they sell. I concluded that you could have made the seat out of pins, and it would not matter. People were sold on the ""perception"" of the car. Reality did not enter into customers decision making process. When Infiniti designed the 1990 Q 45, they made the mistake of actually believing that customer's purchase decisions were based on things like performance. I could have told them, nothing could be further from the truth. Today Infiniti is still suffering from this mistake."
2339,"July 23, 2003 12:03PM",fsv,"Aramus, good luck with the car. If you live in the place where snow falls, don't forget to keep us posted on how the car is in the winter."
2340,"July 23, 2003 6:24PM",ljflx,"The Range Rover was very impressive and I'll drive it again in the future. The LX470 is the favorite given my excellent experience with it but the Range Rover must be seriously considered. Very high quality indeed. It's past reliability would - of course - concern me, particularly now as I intend to buy and take a business tax deduction rather than lease.

A8 - The tires were the standard ones. Now here's something interesting. I received a follow-up call from the sales rep today. No sales pressure - just a very curteous call to see if I was satisfied with the dealer, test drive etc. I had made it clear I wasn't buying or leasing until late in the year and was simply starting to look around. Anyway I told her I was somewhat disappointed in the A8's ride for such a high-end car. She told me that Audi had indeed stiffened the ride and that the car to go for if I wanted smoothness like a Lexus LS or an MB S would be the still unavailable VW Phaeton. Naturally the dealer also owned a VW dealership in another area of my county. So I wonder if Audi/VW has strategized the A8 to be its sport horse and the VW to be its quiet smooth riding car. I assume they are off the same chassis. Not a smart move if that is the case. Fighting MB and BMW (plus Lexus in the US) with two different brands (that ride differently but look similarly) is about as ill conceived a business plan as I've ever seen. So I don't think those who are finding the ride stiff, harsh and noisy are incurring anything but a VW planned experience. It's a shame because the A8 is a stunning car and the only thing I didn't like visually about the car is the rear lights. The paint on this car is the best I've ever seen.

Yes - that was the article. I didn't want you to miss it good buddy. Seeing Jay Leno pull up to a Mac drive through with a Maybach was about as good as seeing a poodle in the back seat of a classic Rolls Royce - being driven by a chaffeur - with no one else in the car. Saw it on Park avenue a long time ago and could never forget it.

Michael - what Lexus board are you referring to - the LS? That has 4000+ posts."
2341,"July 23, 2003 9:41PM",merc1,"You really should go for the Ranger Rover. Most people are awed by it show car looks and interior. I don't like SUVs myself, but I still think it's the best there is right now. Have you seen the new VW Toureg?

Your guess about VW and Audi's strategy is exactly correct. VW is going after Mercedes and Audi is going after BMW. I think in the end Audi will still be Audi and VW will have made some wonderful cars, but won't ever have the dealer setup, or image to take on Mercedes-Benz, nor will they have the sheer depth of models required to do that, nobody does. I'm really anxious to see the Phaeton in person, and check out it's interior, because I have sat in the new Toureg and it has a fabulous interior, probably just as good as the Range Rover, for 20K less. Since people already pay 30-50K for SUVs from everyone else including your average Ford dealer I don't see much a problem for the VW SUV, but the Phaeton I don't see making it here. VW's dealers, mainly their service practices aren't going to jive with a 60K (V8 model) or a 80K (W12 model) car......no matter how lavish the car is.

I posted a link to the Jay Leno/Maybach photos a few posts back. While I love the car's interior I can't say that I'm crazy about it's exterior. I'm so glad that particular stylist is no longer with Mercedes-Benz. He was also responsible for the new CLK, another Benz I'm not crazy about when it comes to it's looks.

2358,"July 25, 2003 5:01PM",sphinx99,"I finally saw a Phaeton today at a high-line Euro body shop I take my car to for scrapes. I chatted with the owner briefly about it, who said that he has had several come in for door ding treatment; the car's wide berth makes it a frequent victim, unfortunately. It was very, very imposing, as far as a VW goes. However, it is hard to imagine the Phaeton sharing the same logo with a VW Rabbit, you know? Hmm."
2359,"July 25, 2003 5:07PM",footie,"Hi DannyTranny

wards is one of the automobile industry's most respected news outlets. They've been doing awards for 'engines of the year' for the last 9 years.

Honda got two awards this year for their 4 and the new V6.

Take a look at wardsauto.com."
2360,"July 25, 2003 7:26PM",linard,"CAR Magazine just reviewed the W12 Phaeton and the reviewer didn't seem to think the Phaeton stands a chance at competing with the other luxury marques. Their main reason was quality, the car had a number of electrical issues and they didn't feel the driving experience was up to par. Interesting article...

I also disagree with the NSX being ridiculous, for a car that came out in 1989, it was named a favorite of both CAR and Top Gear magazines citing the overall completeness and precision of the car. While having only 290 horsepower, it has never been outclassed in any comparison I have ever read. It may be old, but not outdated."
2361,"July 25, 2003 8:03PM",bmwdriver02,I cannot seem to find the link to those pictures of Jay Leno in the Maybach. Can anyone please reference me to the message # or even re-post the link?
2362,"July 26, 2003 4:38PM",ljflx,It was in the NY Times Automobile section last Sunday. It may still be accessible at the NY Times on-line. Merc1 posted the link. It may also be available at the German car fan site.

2364,"July 27, 2003 9:32PM",merc1,"I wouldn't say that NSX is ""ridiculous"" either, but it's surely been outclassed for sure, for a number of years, staring with introduction of the Ferrari F355 and current Porsche 911. While Vipers and Corvette Z06s don't ""outclass"" in handling or engineering they'll definitely beat the NSX pretty badly. The NSX was outdated about 6 years ago at least. It's been outclassed in a few comparisions too, check out some of the old Road and Tracks, one test with Mario Andretti in particular where he picked the Ferrari over the NSX. Now the Europe only NSX-R is still very competitive. Of course with the sales volumes here, it made no sense to bring that version over here.

Sadly, Acura has said no to a V8, which doesn't look too promising because the competition already has V8's and now V10s are coming into focus. It sounded like the like the perfect business plan, a new V8 that could be shared with next RL and NSX.

2365,"July 27, 2003 9:59PM",pablo_l,"...actually, 6 cyls can be very fine engines. Last I checked, Porsche has done rathr OK for many years with a 6 pot in the 911. Beemer's 6 inline is arguably a better engineered engine than the bigger 8 cylinder engines, and when the car isn't porky the power-weight ration makes it the more desirable engine.

The US has a love-thing going for 8 cylinders that is actually not based on any engineering merits that are unique to this engine configuration. But car manufacturers know that the US biying public thinks more cylinders are better, and thus deliver on it.

By the way, I know car engineers that claim that by nature the inline six is a perfectly balanced engine configuration - more so than a V8 (or V6, too)."
2366,"July 27, 2003 11:38PM",jagboyxtype,"A while back, I read an interesting article on Honda and its decision not to create engines as large as V8's for itself or for Acura. Sorry I can't find a link, it was pretty long ago and I didn't save it. The simple reasons stated in the article were that Honda has always prided itself in being a rather ""green"" company - meaning environmentally friendly, as far as automobiles go - and enjoys all of the government perks as well as the ability to advertize its Ultra Low Emissions status, etc. They've deemed it more profitable to not have huge, torque-replete engines, and having a V8 would take away from the image that they've created or are trying to build, of being, well, Honda. The number of cylinders actually doesn't matter so much anymore even for smoothness, and the big thing is displacement. Didn't Ferrari have something like a 2.0-liter V-12 at one point? Sure it was probably a great engine, but a busy machine like that could be simplified by simply having a 4 or 6 cylinder engine of the same size. It could even produce the same power if done correctly, and a simpler engine with less mechanical pieces equalling less chances to fail is often better. It's not like Hondas and Acuras aren't selling because their engines are not competitive, and they aren't trying to go up against an Aston Martin V12 or a Rolls Royce with any of their offerings."

2368,"July 28, 2003 6:51AM",fsv,"G35's or FX35's V6 is a good V6, but you want more, and more comes with 4.5L V8; overall feel of V8, it's smoothness at any rpm's gives you better quality feel. And, luxury car segment stipulates, that when you buy this kind of a car, you get collection of all the desireable goodies, available on the market. V6 is available in economy class segment - so, who wants it? May be it is hard to afford V10 or V12 for the money, but please, give me V8. And V6 - keep it in an Accord or Maxima..."
2369,"July 28, 2003 7:42AM",pablo_l,"Actually, by nature an inline 6 has perfect balance and thus more smoothness than a V8. Ask an engine expert. The reason a V12 is also very smooth it's because it consists of 2 perfectly balanced I6 banks."
2370,"July 28, 2003 8:34AM",michael_mattox,There is an outside chance that I am wrong but I believe the Lexus 4.2L V8 is Greener (exceeds all California emmissions standards) quieter and smoother then any Honda 6.
2371,"July 28, 2003 9:32AM",pablo_l,"...besides, I would hope that not every ""luxury car"" buyer is looking for smoothest, most assisted and ultimately most remote driving experience possible. I do think in this era of ultra-smooth, over-assisted-by-wire, ultra-supple cars, the true mark of luxury will be to introduce some idiosyncratic, entertaining traits -to the less discerning ""flaws""- to achieve differentiation and appeal. I for one got tired and bored by smoothness in the end. Never forget that according to Oscar White, inpracticality is the very essence of luxury.

No one ever called a Morgan Plus 8 smooth. But it is a luxury good."
2372,"July 28, 2003 10:40AM",michael_mattox,"Actually I do not want a sports car as my daily driver. I have a Miata that is entertaining.

I want a remote comfortable, smooth, and quiet driving experience. I want to be pampered in every way possible...I do not want flaws....

I do not want Idiosyncratic, I do not want a thrill ride in my daily driver (there is Disney Land for that or Corvetts or Morgans)

I want to be pampered, I want Luxury."
2373,"July 28, 2003 11:00AM",fsv,the moral here is - have one (or a few/many) of everything. But V8 - entry ticket in this particular class...
2374,"July 28, 2003 12:54PM",pablo_l,"Oscar White was a writer and bon-vivant in the last century.

Luxury does not equal with being pampered. That is *your* choice. But other luxury consumers don't agree, and every company is free to go after a different intended audience.

And V8s are a US idiosynchracy. In Europe, the key is to have a good 6-pot in this class, for that'll be the moneymaker. They seldom even bother importing them into the US.

Finally - a Bentley Arnage's supercharged engine is many wonderful things, but the smoothest engine it certainly ain't. And yet it seems a number of very wealthy luxury sedan buyrers that *could* easily afford a smoother, more practical car, decide they can't have any other car."
2375,"July 28, 2003 9:27PM",michael_mattox,"Hooray for the difference (I am avoiding french terms this year)

We Americans are definately a different breed from our brothers in Europe.

It seems that all the luxuary cars we know and recognize do have V-8s Audi, Rolls, Bently, Mercedes, BMW, Lexus. Lucky for us you guys make them. Note there are no American cars on my list.

We are blessed with lower gas prices and wider roads which has probably helped establish our tastes."
2376,"July 28, 2003 10:07PM",pablo_l,"Well, I do live in the US, but honestly, I don't get the fixation on V8s. They can be crappy engines.

One example: Jaguar. Their I6 was smoother than the very fine V8 they introduced to follow up on it. Torquier, too. Not as powerful in the high end, but what the porkier breed of luxury car needs is foremost torque in order to feel lively.

BMW is the other example: their I6 is one of the smoothest engines on earth. If they build a larger displacement version, it might well be a better fit for larger cars than the somewhat peakier (and slightly less smooth) V8. But they know the US public wouldn't go for it, and thus they don't try.

Don't get me wrong: I am not saying cars with V8s in them aren't great. Truthfully, one can't really make a huge mistake buying any of the cars that have been mentioned in this thread. It's just I don't get the simplistic V8=Luxury notion that seems so prevalent in the US, and which I feel leads to fewer truly distinctive choices.

These supposedly universally accepted rules lead to cars that become more similar to each other every day. I think the car world is poorer for that."

The only reference I could find to Oscar White was a sausage company."
2378,"July 29, 2003 6:51AM",pablo_l,"Oh my God, you are right of course - brain meltdown..."
2379,"July 29, 2003 10:04PM",merc1,"I see Edmunds has a review of the Maybach 57. They're saying pretty much what everyone else has been saying, that the Maybach doesn't provide the styling of a 300K car or enough differentation from the S-Class when it comes to it's interior, for the money that is. I have to say I agree with the majority here. BMW put a lot more effort into the Phantom and it shows. Funny thing is I don't care much for the Phantom either, but it does make more of a statement. Maybach, conservative luxury, Rolls, much more noticeable and over the top. I guess there is room in the market for both approaches, but I have to say I'd take a Bentley Arnage T over either of them.

M"
2380,"July 30, 2003 8:13AM",pablo_l,"I think anyone with a pulse would pick the Bentley over those 2 cars *and* blow the $100k one saved on remodelling the yacht's kitchen sink area or something. :-)

Honestly, Bentleys are some of the few cars in existence that still have *soul*. The Maybach is an over-artificial marketing exercise and is a total miss in design, the Rolls needs its front re-designed to regain its former elegance."
2381,"July 30, 2003 2:28PM",ljflx,"You were onto the styling issue very early in the game on the Maybach - and thought it was its shortcoming - despite your partisan to MB. Apparently you were right on the money and quite objective about it. I only saw one on the road - going into the Lincoln tunnel in the winter and it was filthy due to all the snow on the ground at the time. But the grill with its Lincoln-like look seemed to cheapen the car. I found this ironic for MB - because I think the enlarged grill on the 2003 S-class made it a better looking car. So I liked the grill on one MB and disliked it on its much higher priced brother. I had thought the pre-2003 S-class grill was too small and mousy looking. That was really - in my opinion the only design flaw on the car.

It's really so arbitrary and so personal as to what drives buyers. One spin in the A8 and I knew I could not buy the car. Why? - far too harsh a ride which is a deal breaker item for me. Yet a poster on the A8 board, who also thought the ride was harsh was not driven away from buying the car, or at least is still considering it seriously. So we all have our desires in high-end cars and I would think the higher you go the more selective you get. I still like the Maybach style but if I were in that league of buyers - its reasonably close resemblance to an S-class might end up bothering me. No question that the Rolls - like it or not - is an attention grabber and very unique. The more I see it the more I like it.

Now - in all honesty I am seriously shopping SUV's - not your favorite topic at all. I drove the Tourag today and it is far removed from being in the LX470 and Range Rover league. These are the only - in my opinion - two players in the high-end lux SUV league. Can't go wrong with either. I did finally drive the 2003 LX as well and as good as my 2000 is the new one is an even better luxury ride and quieter still. Maybe it's the 18"" tires. Now I've got to find out the changes in store for 2004. I'm buying this time so I'm really doing my homework."
2382,"July 30, 2003 3:21PM",pablo_l,"I think by far the worst design element in the Mayback is the back of the car. The all-over tailight element is both cheap and utterly outdated in a *bad* (i.e. not ""classic"") way. The front also lacks character, I totally agree. And from the side its vanilla sedan - most cars look pretty much the same in a profile shot these days.

As far as SUVs go -and while I wouldn't drive one, given the quality of many US roads I fully understand why many do- I think the Range Rover is in a clas of its own. I've spent quite a bit of time with the LX470, and it is lovely, but the Range Rover is a class above in interior design. Without a doubt one of the top 5 interiors (in *any* price class) in the automobile world these days. Lovely - especially if you stay away from some of the more questionable greenish color combos (""vomit over bile"") that BMW somehow is growing fond of these days. I'd pick the Range, but as you say, you can't go totally wrong with either."
2383,"July 30, 2003 9:27PM",merc1,"Well you know how I am about styling, astethics and the sheer curbside appeal of these luxury cars, so when one (even an MB made product) doesn't live up to the standard I cannot tell a lie. The Maybach looks are not what they should be. The final test will be when I get to see one on the road, because at all the autoshows this past winter it looked good, but I think imposing would have been a better word. It sure doesn't look anything like the S-Class, the Lincoln analogy is much more accurate. I've got to see one on the open road. There have been a number of German styling misses as of late, the 7-Series, most likely the 5-Series, the CLK coupe, and the Maybach. I haven't seen the new CLK Cabriolet yet.

I'm surprised you didn't like the VW SUV, it's interior has that Audi build to it. Go for the Range Rover, it's a stunner for a ""truck"". I'll be awaiting your final decision.

2384,"July 31, 2003 5:06AM",t6553gw,"I saw and sit in a testing Maybach in Hamburg, once I get close to it, I started to feel excited by the sheer size and once I sit in it, I knew it not just a oversized S-calss, I think somehow it hides its extraordinary character from a distance."
2385,"July 31, 2003 6:37AM",pablo_l,"That plasticky late 80s Oldsmobile posterior is still inexcusable, though. No one doubts the Maybach is a technology tour de force and has phenomenal inner values. It just doesn' caress the eye."
2386,"July 31, 2003 2:31PM",eric312,"I recently bought a 2001 740I and I keep having random electronic problems with it. Just wondering if someone has experienced something similar. For example:
1. When I press the button on the door the side mirrors do not close
2. When the door is open I have to press and hold the memory button in order to get driver’s seat into programmed position. According to the manual I should only have to hold the button when the door is closed.
3. Alarm does not unlock the doors until I unlock them with a key manually.
4. If I leave the car parked with the front wheels turned, when I come back to the car and start driving the steering wheel is very stiff until I stop with the wheels straight and turn off the car for a few minutes.
All of the above happens randomly so if I just go to the dealer I will not be able to demonstrate it to him.

Three more “improvement” questions:
1 Has anyone connected a later model Motorola phones to 740 instead of the old StarTec that it came with and how much did it cost?
2. Where and for how much can I buy updated DVDs for navigation?
3 Is it possible to watch TV and play DVD on the navigation screen?"
2387,"July 31, 2003 3:59PM",blockislandguy,"Eric212, come one, you're kidding?"
2388,"August 1, 2003 11:05AM",jagboyxtype,"""2. Where and for how much can I buy updated DVDs for navigation?
3 Is it possible to watch TV and play DVD on the navigation screen?""

Navigation DVD's should be available, at least to be ordered, from your BMW dealer/service department.

I don't believe U.S. cars have the ability to play movies in the navigation screen; for safety reasons, U.S.-bound cars usually have the feature turned off making it impossible to watch movie DVD's while at rest or at speed. In Europe, BMWs, Jaguars, and Mercedes I believe, all have the ability to play movie DVD's in the nav system, so it is possible to rewire the thing to work...

Other stuff all seems pretty minor too; for the most part, it sounds like some of the electrical connections are not getting through, and something's up with your power-steering pumps or something if the wheels are acting up that way. Just go to your dealer and have them fix it all, if not just to get rid of annoyances like non-functioning buttons, at least to be safe with the steering system. Hope all goes well."
2389,"August 5, 2003 8:14AM",merc1,"Road and Track (Sept) has a review of the Maybach 57 too. Their review is saying basically the same thing as all the rest, outstanding interior thats better than the exterior. Their test car is Black over Grey, and somewhat better looking than the lighter color choices. The performance of the 57 is unbelievable for car of it's size and weight, 4.9 secs 0-60 and 60 mph through the slalom, which is about 4 mph slower than the Cadillac XLR, SL500 and Jaguar XK8. Its the same as the SC430.

I know you're looking at SUV and you want luxury over sport...so something like a Cayenne Turbo is out huh?

M"
2390,"August 5, 2003 7:19PM",ljflx,"I don't have too much doubt that the Maybach is the best car on the planet. I just wish someone (not my wife with our joint money) would buy me one.

SUV's - I've decided to hold off on the decision to later in the year. I'll take a 2004 rather than a late model 2003. I love both the Range Rover and the LX but the latter will likely be the choice because of the higher seating capacity. I don't like the Cayenne at all. In fact I have mistaken the Santa Fe (Hyundai or whoever makes it) for it in my rear mirror a few times. I'm sure it's got Porsche quality and sportiness all over it but I can't bring myself to buy an SUV for sport features. A friend of mine moved from a Landcruiser to an X-5 and said the latter is not good in rain let alone in snow. He loves it but for SUV driving wishes he had stayed with the TLC. He also misses the interior space. SUV's - as I use them are for people hauling, heavy cargo and require plenty of interior room, comfort and luxury but I don't like the real large ones. Thus the RR and LX hit the sweet spot perfectly. Plus I like the car like ride that both the RR and LX have for such big imposing vehicles. They both have nearly as good a ride quality as the S-class and LS430 lux sedans.

I think I've become boring when it comes to cars. In the lux end it's the S vs. LS (love both and fully appreciate the excellence of both), in the SUV land it's the RR vs the LX (same opinion as above) and in the sport end I love the SL and SC. I also love the CCI if I wanted to go cheaper. Regardless of price points what am I most likely to buy in that group - LS, LX and SL. I'm past my SC desire (still love everything about the car though) but in all honesty I'm a likely SL buyer (it's MB's most special car in my opinion - excluding AMG's) within 3+ years when I sell out my shares in a business I own.

On another front - Interesting story in the business section of todays NY Times. Apparently more and more Europeans are buying Japanese (Toyota naturally leading the way) cars. Since I go to Europe often I know how difficult it is to crack the nationalistic buying trends there. The primary reason the Japanese are gaining share is the high build quality, high reliability and the lower prices. I think in the years to come you will see Lexus start to penetrate that luxury market as well. Slowly at first and then quicker and quicker. That's the way it has gone in the UK. The article did say the European manufacturers are starting to form alliances to fight it off. At least they are reacting early in the game - unlike GM, Ford and Chrysler who ended up being reactive rather than proactive 20+ years ago."
2391,"August 5, 2003 9:35PM",merc1,"Well you knew I'd go for that. I'm just waiting to see a Maybach on the street.

I can fully understand your position with SUVs. They really are meant for utility and/or off roading and the RR and the TLC are the best at doing both luxury and off roading, especially the Range Rover.

I say instead of a SL500, try a SL55...that should liven things up a bit. Or since you're looking at 2-door cars, what about a CL500 or CL55? While I love the SL too, I think the CL is Mercedes best car, SL style, and more room. The Cabrio version of the CL (2004 or 05) should be about perfect. Which car did you mean in your third paragraph ""CCI""?

I'll read the Maybach story tommorrow. I see that Edmunds also reviewed it.

Alright - I'm going to bed. Reading materials for a long board meeting tommorrow made me come back to Edmunds for some last second relaxation. I rarely see you post this late. You're usually an early bird."

Well a BMW 330Ci is a fine car too, and I'm sure it's merely a matter of writing a check for you.

Yep I saw the Lexus V10 GT, its a interesting car, except for the styling. The rear end being what needs work the most. I'm not so sure if the car should be a Lexus or a Toyota, the Lexus name has a long way to go with people who like Porsches and Ferraris. Anyway it's much to early to get into that, the car is still a ways off. Just like the Frankfurt show reveals all for the German brands, all eyes will be on Toyko this year for these Toyotas/Lexus models as well as the next RL, and possibly some type of NSX concept.

I'm more interesting in seeing the next Supra. I'd had no problem with buying a this particular Toyota. All they have to do is price it like the 350Z, match or exceed that car's peformance and styling and most importantly give it a better interior than the Z. The Z's interior reminded me of a cardboard box in look, feel and smell. The one I drove had about 30 miles on it and it rattled like a years old car. I never thought about the car since.

Nope, never in my short time (since about 85') of following cars seriously have I seen such a glut of expensive and powerful cars. I can't imagine being one of the richy-rich that can afford to buy whatever. I'd go mad. I think I'd have about 20-25 cars!

2402,"August 7, 2003 5:52AM",ljflx,You don't want a Maybach?
2403,"August 7, 2003 7:37AM",bwia,"Merc1

In the September issue of Road & Track's review of the Maybach to which you refer, there is also a boxed tidbit on the potential Mercedes Benz customer.

It said the typical Mercedes Benz buyer had an annual income of two to three times the purchase price of the car or $250,000 and for the Maybach an annual income of $1 million or more.

According to the IRS, Over 144,000 returns for 1997 showed adjusted gross incomes over $1 Million, so there is a &#147;huge&#148; market for the limited production Maybach."
2404,"August 7, 2003 12:55PM",pablo_l,"I think you need more than $1M to justify blowing $300k on a car. It'd be inexcusably poor financial planning to buy something like a Maybach unless your net worth is significantly higher than $10M, I'd say. There is a very profitable market for ultra-luxury cars, but it is getting very crowded due to the post-bubble syndrome - they started to design all sorts of ultra-luxury vehicles as so many people hit it off big, and they're getting to market now that many fortunes have fizzled. It'll be interesting to witness - no doubt many people still have a lot of money left, but the general mood seems to have swung against rampant extravagance. The excess that was so acceptable in 2000 has given way to elegant understatement in my opinion. Our company's parking lot is a testament to that, especially during board meetings. Three board members whose net worth I'd conservatively estimate north of $50M each and that used to drive an assortment of Ferraris, Astons and CL600s now drive around in a Merc ML, a Lex LS and a BMW 5 series respectively. I myself got rid of my Jag XJR and got myself a Saab to not project the wrong image with customers painfully affected by layoffs and other hardship, not because I had to, but because I truly felt uncomfortable. It is a different world, and unless you're at a point where you truly can afford to rub people the wrong way and not care, being all too excessive is not that cool. And a Maybach or Rolls are damn blatant signs of excess.

On top of not being able to afford a Maybach unless I was intent on mid-term financial suicide, my objection to cars like the Maybach and Rolls is that they're too damn big to be fun to drive around, and unless you are *truly* rich you'll be close to a nervous break-down whenever you drive in city traffic. I know that also bugged me when I owned the XJR, the constant paranoia about something happening to it (which is inevitable) - the new car has been a very liberating experience in that respect given Bay Area traffic and lack of civility. I can't even begin to comprehend how I'd feel if I was sitting within $350k of bills on wheels..."
2405,"August 7, 2003 3:37PM",ljflx,I think he meant $1mln in annual compensation or annual income - not net worth or net cash. Such an income would likely relate to someone who has $10mln in net cash. I would say 3-5mln in net cash while you are still earning a high income (say equal to the car price at a minimum) does it though - if you are care free. But logic tells me that most people in that grouping though are still investing in future businesses or investments for healthy returns rather than buying an asset like a Maybach that will rapidly lose value. The Maybach is really for people who have so much excess cash that it hardly matters to them if it loses 40% of its value over 3 years.
2406,"August 7, 2003 9:25PM",pablo_l,"The claim was that the 144,000 people that according to the IRS made $1M or more in '97 were proof the Mayback has a very large market, as if each and every one these 144k people automatically represent potential customers that in 2003 can wing a $300k+ car purchase. Admittedly, there might be *more* than 144k people making over $1M in 2003 (in fact I think I recall recently reading something to that effect), but it is my opinion the ""natural"" target customer base for something like a Maybach is significantly smaller in number."
2407,"August 8, 2003 7:02AM",ljflx,"Agree. It's probably 25-35% of that 144,000 today that are really in the league of buyers. Most of that group that had that income in 1997 (and even today) probably had/have just a flash income year due to the market or some other asset sale and likely did/do not have the real financial net worth underpinning for it to continue. This is indeed a very small market and the cars will not turn over fast. The other thing is that the car is guaranteed to lose value fast. Think about it. If a Maybach retained 75-80% of its value after three years would you buy a used one for $250k or a new one for $320k. Heck if you had that kind of money you hardly care about $70k plus you want all that new car sale pampering that a car like that gets. Thus the car will fall to a price where other buyers exist - which is well below its original value. It's just a normal supply and demand story. But I doubt that many people who buy a Maybach or a Rolls will turn it over in three years anyway. Most will likely hold the car for 5-10 years. Which is another reason why it is a very small market."
2408,"August 8, 2003 11:59AM",merc1,"No Maybach on my wish list, at least not yet. I need to see the car outside of a magazine or an autoshow to truly get a good look at it.

bwia,

I'm sure there is a pretty good size market for the car. They sold 13 in the U.S. in June, I wonder what July's sales total was? I'd be curious to know what other cars are in a Maybach onwer's garage.

2409,"August 8, 2003 12:33PM",syswei,"Just because a large number of people could afford a Maybach doesn't mean that a large fraction will buy one. The same number of people could afford to sink 300k into a super-high-end home stereo system, but few do.

Whatever the number of Bentleys and Rolls Royces sold annually is, don't expect Maybach's entry into the market to expand the market by all that much. Maybe the market grows to between 1.2x and 2x what it was."

2413,"August 8, 2003 7:11PM",bwia,"Merc1/Pablo

According to Automotive news MB plans to build 1,500 Maybachs a year, and expects 70 to 80 percent of all Maybachs will be sold to current Mercedes-Benz owners who want more than a top-level S class.

I don't know what percentage they expect to sell in the U.S. but let's assume 50% of production or 750 cars. The latest IRS statistics show that 193,798 tax returns with adjusted gross incomes of over $1 million were filed in 2001. In California alone there were 30,843 taxpayers with incomes of over $1 million.

So, to reach their target sales level they only need to sell one Maybach per each 258 people with incomes over $1 million. I am not a sales guy but this does not appear to be an unreasonable target."
2414,"August 8, 2003 7:47PM",ljflx,"I'm Italian (with little to no creativity in design) and I think the Italians design the most beautiful cars in the world - but that Maserati Quatroporte isn't anything special to me. Naturally I've only seen pix (in most mags these days) so in person I may view it more favorably. But I think it looks like a Jag up front and a 7 series (albeit a better looking one) from the side. It's the first Maserati I've ever seen that I don't think is special or a car I'd love to own.

We are getting to know one another too well my friend, as I was just going to ask you what your opinion of it is. So what do you think?

By the way - I do like the Phaeton - quite a bit actually - but I still don't see it making it.

No Lexus stops tommorrow - I'm disappointed in you. I still want you behind the wheel of an LS430 and an objective opinion of it."
2415,"August 9, 2003 1:10PM",pablo_l,"bwia - the target you mention is not unrealistic when you put it like this. Then again, 1,500 cars at over $300k is a hell of a lot, historical market trends for ultra-luxury cars in hand. If 50% are to be sold in the USA (which is a perfectly valid assumption), it means they have to sell 2 every day. That is a lot of $300k cars, and can't happen without stealing away very sizeable market share from someone else, Ferrari included. Historically, volumes for such cars have not been as high. We will have to see whether the combined lot of Bentleys, Rolls, Maybach etc etc really deliver on their projections. It will be interesting to observe, especially considering that sales for luxury cars in general (anything over $40k) are down. The super-rich are never as dependent on macro-economic trends, of course, but all you need is for understatement to become chic to really create some hurt in that market. I think there the equation becomes whether something is unique and cool enough to get them to spend yet *another* $300k on yet another car, and while the Maybach might fit the bill, if I had that type of money the Maybach would be one of the last cars to truly get my jiuces flowing. Unless the company forces it upon me as a corporate limo, I probably would not consider it. I'd much rather have something with personality, like a Bentley Arnage. Incidentally, Georg Kacher arrived at exactly the same conclusion after driving the Bentley, Maybach and Rolls offerings, and while everybody's taste is likely to be different, he usually gets the car enthusiast's choice very right.

As to the Maserati, the design all in all is sound, with some Maserati cues (which historically have not been the prettiest Italian cars, I think), but somewhat droopy looking in the front. I think the lower part, scoops and such, of the car front let the design down, they seem kit-car-like add-ons, even though lights and grill and hood are quite nice.

The Phaeton has received terrible reviews in the German press. It's supposed to drive very ponderously and feel heavier than it is. The quality of the cabin is supposed to be awesome, however. It seems getting the first luxury sedan out of the door is always going to be an experiment at first - Audi in its time also took its time getting the feel of the A8 right."
2416,"August 9, 2003 5:02PM",ljflx,I wonder if the European pubs dissed the Phaeton because it is a VW and not a lux brand. Last time I was in Europe there was a lot of criticism for VW even thinking of introducing such a car. No one had yet seen it let alone driven it yet people were already lined up against it. Europe is a tough market to crack with its nationalistic and socialistic (cast) system approach to buying goods and services. Remember all the criticism of the Euro Disneyland. I think the car has a better chance of making it here before it does in Europe. But I doubt it will make it here because Audi can't cut it with the A8 and VW reliability and quality is in the basement right now.
2417,"August 9, 2003 5:20PM",300eguy05,I like the new Maserati a lot. It's front end looks like a big softened Rx-8. And the headlights remind me of those found in the Passat. Am I blind here? Does anyone else see what I see?
2418,"August 9, 2003 5:45PM",ljflx,Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I don't dislike it but it doesn't make a great impression with me. Pablo said it well - it has a droopy look in the front and personally I think it has a Jaguar like shape in the front as well. On the side it's a more elegant 7-series to my eyes. Somehow I think the car will look better in person though.
2419,"August 9, 2003 5:52PM",pablo_l,"I actually think the European public, by and by, is far more willing to give new exciting stuff a try than the US buying public, which adheres very strictly to some unwritten buying rules. It was a German mag that trashed the VW in its comparison against Audi and BMW. Interestingly, the only place where I have read question marks about VW breaking into the luxury market has been in the US press - the German mags never questioned whether the VW ""brand"" could be luxury - fact is in Europe it already is regarded as an uppity brand, VWs always carry a premium against other cars in its category in Europe. The reason given by AutoBild.de was preception of untamed weight, simply based on how the Phaeton drove."
2420,"August 9, 2003 6:00PM",pablo_l,"Incidentally, while re-reading autobild.de to make sure I wasn't making up things about the Phaeton, despite very lukewarm reviews the Phaeton has become the best selling luxury sedan in Germany right away.

2421,"August 9, 2003 6:58PM",syswei,I remember reading in the WSJ maybe 4-6 months ago that the Phaeton only did 50% of VW's first year sales forecast. Could be they were wrong but I think that's what they said.

2423,"August 9, 2003 7:19PM",300eguy05,"  You are probably correct. In my opinion, it is a very beautiful car in the pictures, as I'm sure it will be in person as well.

  And while the Phaeton, in my opinion, is also nice looking, a poster on the Phaeton board said it was over 5000 lbs!! Very hefty for this class."
2424,"August 9, 2003 8:25PM",fsv,"I personally would go for Phaeton, when it is a couple of years old - I just have this philosophy - don't buy them new.... I'd say, that Phaeton and Maybach are great and daring efforts from two great companies, and these effort should be supported by us all; since they are trying to make our life richer in experience and choice - German saying is - ""Wer hat die Wahl, der hat die Quahl, und wer nich waehlt, der wird gequaehlt"" would be the best illustration for that.

2426,"August 10, 2003 1:05PM",pablo_l,"The Maybach logo is simply two Ms for Maybach Motorenbau GmbH (Maybach Engine Construction Inc). Founded after WW1 by Karl Maybach, son of car pioneer and Daimler partner Wilhelm Maybach. I think now they officially call it Maybach Manufaktur (not Motorenbau), as if to make it sound classier.

Note the classic Maybach Motorenbau was not exclusively into luxury cars, those were more of a side business. Ironically, Maybach himself was a high-powered diesel fan and thus loved trucks. Maybach was also the engine supplier for the feared German panzers in WW2."
2427,"August 10, 2003 9:42PM",merc1,"I'm not sure about those production numbers, and wha they want to sell in the U.S. Last time I heard/read anything about Maybach's plans it was 1000 cars total and maybe 400 for the U.S., with most of those buyers coming from people in the Bentley, Rolls-Royce sector, combined with someone looking at expensive artwork, boats etc. There is no way they'll sell 750 308K+ cars in the U.S. But your breakdown of the numbers of who can buy one is very interesting and since I'm not anywhere near that group I'll have to take your word for it.

ljflx,

Nope, no Lexus shopping and not by my doing, honest. I know Lex dealers treat you like royalty, but around here unless you strike them as fitting in a certain demograph when you walk through the door, they're pretty rude and snobbish, there is no way I could put up with them long enough for them allow me to drive an LS430.

Yes! Italian styling is the best. Ferrari and Alfa being at the top of the list. Europeans in general, excluding the French, make the best looking cars on the plant, imo. Between Ferrari, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini, Alfa-Romeo, Maserati, Jaguar, and Bentley there is just a glut of gorgeous machines.

The VW Phaeton is a lost cause I think. I think It's a brilliant luxury cruiser, but it's wearing the wrong badge (for numerous reasons) and simply won't have the dealer setup worthy of such a car, if and when it goes on sale here. Now the Euro press has knocked the car mainly for being overweight and not sporty enough, as it weighs a good 600lbs more than A8L. But like pablo_l touched on the car has a stunning interior and should impress a few Americans enough to buy it, but it won't be anywhere near VW's sales goals. VW, per AutoWeek is saying it will go on sale in Oct. We'lll see.

The Maserati Quattroporte I'll have to see in person, but it does look at lot better in the autospies pictures than it did in those first-release shots.

2432,"August 12, 2003 1:27AM",merc1,"Interesting question, as we've discussed this before in this thread. I don't think we'll ever see those models here because of their price relative to the top line V8 versions of the 5-Series, A6, E-Class, S-Type, and the single car that bridges the gulf in between..the LS430. A six-cylinder of the 7-Series just wouldn't fly now, neither would an A8. The BMW is way too heavy and Audi has worked very hard to postion the A8L as a premium car, and a 6-cylinder variant would just be a mistake now. I personally would like to see the 735i, S350 and XJ 3.5 V8 on sale here, if only to give more people to truly experience the top car from each of these brands, for a lesser price. Not everyone is caught up on sheer hp. I do think the Benz V6 would have to be spruced up a little to compete with those smaller displacement V8s. I don't think anyone else can pull off a 6-cylinder car in this class now except Mercedes because they were the last to do it.

Mercedes in particular shocked a few people by dropping the 6-cylinder S-Class from the U.S. lineup, as the old S320 made up 40 percent of S-Class sales during some years of the previous S-Class' run from 1992-1999.

I could see a lot of people choosing a car like these over a LS430, the only car that would cover their price point. Of course the Japanese car would have a power advantage, but that would be about it.

The price of having the right image is high in the U.S. market as these are seen as ""premium"" cars and thus no sixes or even small eights are deemed worthy. Now if you want to talk diesels, they'll be bringing them as soon as they can!

2438,"August 12, 2003 7:18AM",pablo_l,"Mercedes seems a decent case study: in Europe of course they offer the S350 and the S430. Whether power difference (245 vs 279) and supposed smoothness of the V8 (which I am not always convinced of) truly justifies a $11k+ premium of the latter in Europe is a question. I think quite a few people would grab the S350 if it was available in the US, because it seems a rational choice: a bit less power, but also lighter by 150lbs, and near identical in 0-60 times.

Of course, Mercedes also lowers the price of the S430 for US market purposes.

I just find it interesting, since when it comes to their SUV offerings it seems somehow magically they arrived unanimously at the conclusion that you must offer both 6 and 8 pot configurations.

Finally, I have always find it somewhat amusing that, in a country limited to 65mph that are enforced by a highway police force with less sense of humor than the German Gestapo (my Californian perspective speaking), somehow car consumers cry out for the models with the additional power, and the love affair with bigger displacement for its own sake continues.

Before I get told I should give Japanese cars a chance: when I moved to the US, initially I got an Infiniti because I wanted the most troublefree ownership experience, and truly wanted the appliance-like utility that Japense brands seem to bring along, popular-wisdom-wise. Bad luck: it was the worst car I have had reliability like, its rear bumper paint job lasted less than my Fiat Uno's many years ago, and it's the only car to ever leave me stranded by a highway other than a Citroen (the latter having the good excuse it was over 10 years old and very poorly maintained). My least favorite car ever was that Infiniti - other than the fact I didn't lose much money when getting rid of it again after less than 2 years, and that the service experience was always very good (though I got to enjoy it more often than I'd like) I can't say much good about it. I replaced it with a mildly used Jag XJS convertible with a horrid reputation for reliability, and it was the most reliable car I have ever had - never had one single issue. That comes to sho how much one should be ruled by consensus when making an individual choice."
2441,"August 12, 2003 12:01PM",footie,"You are absolutely right.

Individual experience is individual experience.

The statistics for Infiniti, which these days is right behind Lexus, are very good, far better than MB, Jag and Audi.

What you point out is that unfortunately you were one of the relatively small number of folks that have bad experiences with Infiniti.

Similarly, you were fortunately one of the relatively few that had a great experience with a Jag.

Nothing like being a double outlier. (ier not iar)"

2443,"August 12, 2003 3:28PM",pablo_l,"Actually, I think public consensus typically lags about 5 years behind evidence. I read somewhere Infiniti had some issues for a while -as did Nissan as a whole- but they fixed them in time for their ""Japanese built"" reputation to not take a dent. Similarly, Jaguar had quite stellar reliability rating before people started to realize it was no longer the brand with electronics designed by Satan himself.

As with everything, people should buy what they enjoy. There are no bad cars anywhere near this price category, there are just different value propositions that appeal to different people. And it is wired in part of my car credo that there isn't a single car brand that is ""better than"" whoever else - it is all merely a function of someone buying into the value propositions the brand accentuates with their cars.

  I'm sure you guys know Horsepower doesn't tell the whole story. I think the old XJ had 290 HP and not 280 as reported. Not that it makes a difference. Does anyone really care whether their car can do 0-60 in 6.5 sec instead of 6.2? Everyone ought to know Lexus builds a solid car on par with pretty much anyone. If you want to drive like a race car driver go buy a M5, pure and simple.

  I think we've (Lexus enthusiasts) all have our fill of the Lexus bashing crowd. Moving on..What do you all think of the '04 LS430 revision? (You can get the pictures at the Japanese Website of Toyota) I thought it looks more aggressive, but preserves the look. The Autospies pictures were WAY off, thank godness. I'd hate to have my '02 LS look old only after one year of ownership!!!

Here's a question for the whole forum. Do you all think Automakers are cramming too many electronics into their cars? I feel they are focusing less on the mechanics in favor of developing new toys for their customers.

Your thoughts would be appreciated,
SV"
2455,"August 13, 2003 7:55AM",pablo_l,"I had a Lexus LS430 for a week: drove a friend to the airport, he asked to also keep his car and drive it all I wanted. There is no doubt it is a superbly well made car, I certainly haven't seen anyone dispute that. I liked the interior quality. And if you like a car that siolates you from the exterior -including the road- this is the right car for you. Personally, I like more feedback, I like to be entertained while driving. With that I am not saying the Lexus drives like a Lincoln towncar - it's nothing like that. In my opinion, however, the biggest strike against it is unimaginative styling. Just like I find the new 7-series ugly, I find the Lexus very boring. The day Lexus hires some Nissan designers (about the only Japanese car brands that cranks out designs that aren't terminally bland, in my opinion) it'll be a different story. But design, of course, is a personal thing."
2456,"August 13, 2003 8:08AM",pablo_l,"I agree - HP figures only tell 33% of the story, as anyone who's ever driven a Mini Cooper S, BMW 330 coupe or old Saab 900 turbo knows. The gearing (and clutch in manual) is key to how lively and fast a car feels and also really is, as is its weight.

I also think at some point in time we will see car manufacturers making ""purists"" versions of their cars, with no or very scaled back electronic intervention for some models. With big cars like these, you definitely want electronics to assist when the going gets rough, because a 300HP large and heavy car set free is no easy thing to control. As to interior electronic ammenities, to this day it amazes me that they invest so much money into their silly and misconceived user interfaces, instead of going for a familiar computer interface (the new Microsoft PocketPC or so) - I mean, use *graphics* if you're making things this complex, for heaven's sake! All those rolling menus are anachronistic idiocy."

2460,"August 13, 2003 7:37PM",ljflx,"Do you like the Maserati?

What cars did you end up seeing or driving/riding in last weekend and what were your perceptions of them?"
2461,"August 13, 2003 9:35PM",merc1,"Yes I'm liking the Maserati more and more. I especially find the interior to be such a relief from the regular business like interiors of the S-Class, 7-Series, A8 and LS430. It's so sensual and scultped...the only thing close in this reguard is a Jaguar's interior. The Quattroporte is exactly what it should be, different from all the rest. I can't wait to see the car in person.

Well I didn't get a chance to see a Maybach at the Benz dealer, they didn't have any around. I guess this strictly by order thing is for real.

We looked at the Acura TL-S, TSX, Passat W8, and the Infiniti G35. Now I'll tell you honestly the G35 Coupe could be my next car whenever I decide I want another car note, I haven't had one since 2000. I love the power and styling overall. I'm not crazy about the rather thick looking rear bumper on the coupe, and some pieces of the interior are cheap feeling/looking.
Anyway back to the sedans, which is why we went in the first place. My friend likes the G35 sedan the best, he as did his uncle hated the TSX, mainly because in automatic form its too slow. We'll go back to the Acura dealer in early Oct to see the new TL. The salesmen were talking as its going to re-write the rules of the entry level market...we'll see. The Passat W8 is almost impossible to find in the Sport configuration. The regular W8 is ok, but it really does need the sportier chassis setup to appreciate the W8 engine. I stand in awe of the Toureg, it's got a knockout interior, and in V8 form is a very complete truck. Dealer says the big vee-dub will be here in Oct, with the V8 going for about 60K and the W12 for about 75K. Can't wait to see that.

Where are you in your decisions for 2004? Range Rover, SL500 and LS430? Or is it LS430, SL500 and LX470 or GX470? I guess you can tell I really want you to try one European car huh..

M"
2462,"August 13, 2003 9:43PM",pablo_l,"The Maserati interior indeed had me also thinking ""Jaguar"", albeit with some more modern Italian style elements, and the leather stitching seems a beaut.

The Passat is a much better car in 6 cyl configuration - pass on the nose heavy W8. A colleague bought one and hates it since he rode in another colleague 6cyl...

Also agree on the Infiniti G35. European prestige vendors better start taking note of the stuff Nissan corporation is doing, because Ghosn has implemented the most remarkable turn-around witnessed in a while: keep the built quality, spice up the design, and explore lifestyle niches other vendors with less imagination haven't tried.

Totally agree on the Touareg - awesome interior."
2463,"August 13, 2003 11:00PM",merc1,"I just read your question about electronics and yes I think Mercedes and BMW especially have gone far enough with this. One thing thats driving this techo war is the fact that every maker in the true luxury class of cars is making a better product and it's getting harder to stand out above the crowd. Some do it by styling/horsepower/innovations (Mercedes and to a lesser extent Jaguar), others do it by sheer quality and refinement (Lexus) and others do it by handling prowess and providing a more stimulating driving experience (BMW)...and then you have Audi that aims to provide all of the above in one dynamic package in the A8.

The side show to all of this is the hp war between the German automakers.

Your concerns have been heard by Mercedes-Benz of all companies. In a recent article in Automobile Magazine and Britian's CAR Magazine, its reported that Mercedes has decided NOT to go ahead with even more complex things like automatic lane correction, among other almost unbelievable things. They (Mercedes) thank god, have also decided not to try and match BMW's idrive concept. The next Comand system is to be designed by Nokia, instead of their current supplier...it should be much simpler to use and more reliable.

BMW has obviously heard the complaints too, as the 5-Series' idrive controller is reported to be much simpler. Audi got wind of the whole thing much earlier and made the A8's MMI system much easier to use than BMW's idrive or Mercedes' Comand setup.

I'm anxious to drive the new 5-Series with it's new electronic variable-ratio steering rack though, in theory it sounds perfect, but the press will tear it apart if it lacks that all important ""feel"" that a BMW's steering is supposed to have.

I wonder what other innovations are coming down the pike from any of these brands?

2466,"August 14, 2003 9:51AM",sv7887,"Hi All,
  Merc, I'm glad to hear MB is holding back on implementing an iDrive concept. That sort of thing drives me crazy. I think it's better if Automakers focus more on the drivetrain and interior design.

  Obviously some innovations such as Traction Control and ABS are welcome. I like the Heads up Display on the new 5 Series. It's a good way to keep the driver's attention on the road where it should be. But, gimmicks like Voice Activated Controls on my LS430 annoy the everlasting hell out of me.

   As far as the HP wars..What are you going to do with all that power? In Massachusetts, you'll be pulled over after 70 MPH. Unless you live in Montana, what's the use? (Of course: Bragging Rights) I don't really care that my LS430 has 40 more Horsepower than my older LS400.

As for the future..It'd be nice to see automakers come out with a simple attachment to integrate any current cell phone into the car Cellular system. I know this is hardly Innovation, but it would be useful, as I'd rather not spend $700 just to get the ""Lexus"" carphone!

I think that systems like idrive, and MMI, are great concepts. But they need to be done right. I'm sure that after time, they become easier to use.

And even if Mercedes stays away from a system like idrive, there is no doubt in my mind that this next S will be a technological tour de force. Let's just hope Mercedes doesn't take any styling hints from the BMW killer, Mr. Bnagle!

I'm likely staying LX and LS. I'm a year or two away from my toy car and that is when you will likely get me behind the wheel of an MB SL500. I saw a guy behind the wheel of a new SL500 today. He was enjoying a big fat cigar and looked like a very happy camper. He was headed south on the New Jersey Turnpike - top down - with me at about 75mph - away from all those big power outages in NY. I passed him rather easily in the LS430 by the way.

The SL is faster to 60, in top speed and just about every other way than an LS is. It has incredible midrange torque (I have one) and can accelerate as seemingly effortlessly from 60 to 120 as it does from 0 to 60.

The bottom line, though, for me is not acceleration or top speed but aethetics, safety and innovation. I find the Lexus to be consistantly insipid and lacking in inspiration."

Just yesterday, talking to my wife, I stated that for me to switch to SUVs would take a Range Rover. But for now the Vespa we just bought is the only motorized vehicle purchase. :-) Ah, the SL, very discerning stuff. I still feel they puts a few too many line and creases of the design, but I'd take the SL500 any day, and keep the extra horsepower models - the softer versions are typically the Mercedes version with the more classic benz character, in my opinion.

The Miata is a great car, when they came out in the early 90s, a very good friend of mine got one, and I toyed with the idea. But the Mini is the only sub-30k car in the US that appeals t me - in Europe things would be different, they have a slew of smart, spiffy and very stylish little cars."

The dealer put new batteries in and walla, everything was fine. No other problems to report and I must say that my dealer, Phillips Automotive of Virginia Beach is great. THe service department is always responsive and I do get superstar treatment. If I call a day in advance they will put me in a C-class benz or better.

2491,"August 30, 2003 11:25AM",i_drive,"hello.
i am new to the board.

i have a 2003 SL55AMG, Lexus GX470, and a 2002 S430. all of them are fantastic cars, except for my S-Class. It's been literally a pain in the a_s.

i finally decided to replace it with either of the following:

1) 2004 BMW 745LI (refreshed model)
2) 2004/2005 MB S-Class
3) 2003 S500
4) 2004 Audi A8L
5) 2004 LS430 Ultra luxury

i have owned many BMW, MB, and Lexus products. i had a particuliarily great time with lexus, having owned 9 LS400's. i recently traded in my wife's '99 ML320 for the GX470. i loved my old 3-series from the 80's, and my MB 300E coupe.

unfortunately, i had a terrifying experience with my '02 S430. i don't know which of the five to get. should i wait until the new models come out in a year or two, or just get a current model now and wait until the ""bugs"" are out of the new models?

and also, i caught my first in-person glimpse of the new Maybach at LA. It was at the dealership where i bought the SL.

although I really love lexus for its reliability, and performance (my LS400 was faster than my S430), i must say that lexus lost a loyal customer for the LS430. for the past few years, I always purchased an LS without a doubt, but last year, with the introduction of the new BMW 7-series, Mercedes S-Class (you really can't go wrong in terms of style with a big benz), and the upcomming Audi A8L, i suddenly realized that Lexus was lagging in avant-garde styling, interior design, and real, sporty performance. my son used to complain that he would get nausea by sitting in the rear seat of the LS400; the suspension was so mushy.

i got the GX because that was ideal for my family, but i'll stick with the german companies until lexus redoes their styling and sportiness. and its also because of that that i got the SL55 than the SC430."

Maybe style and safety are more important to me. Maybe value and understatement is more important to you. That's fine. Lexus is a more reliable car. Even Toyota makes amazingly refined engines (I used to own one). But that's not enough to overcome the aesthetics of the car (for me). Maybe that's a shallow and stupid way to spend my money but (as Nietzsche said): ""Here I stand. I cannot do otherwise. At least I have the courage of my bad taste."""

Now Merc1 thinks the LS430 copied the old S-class. So if you agree you must also think the old S-class is a refrigerator. Yet many hard core MB buyers (not fans) think the old S-class was the end of the great MB's. I don't agree - by the way - but those I know think MB veered too far from their normal path with the S re-design.

I think the Lexus slogan was/is actually ""the relentless pursuit of perfection"" (said passionately in the ads)."
2499,"August 30, 2003 8:45PM",boo20,"I don't see any inconsistency in claiming that Lexus tries to copy MB and yet produces less appealing designs. It's surely not an exact copy. Nobody is claiming that. They surely want to differentiate themselves in some way and yet still evoke hints at classic MB lines. But the result, although appealing to some, is not attractive to my eye.

Anyway the whole business about Lexus copying MB syling cues does not bother me. What's more significant to me are MB innovations that don't make it into Lexus for several years (until Lexus has 'perfected' them so to speak). Yes, I've raised the dreaded and despised 'innovation' argument.

Like I've said before: I'm grateful to Lexus for keeping MBs feet to the fire. They are less likly to take their customers for granted when facing stiff competition."
2500,"August 30, 2003 9:29PM",i_drive,"you know-

i just can't help but feel overwhelmed by the comfort, and power behind the wheel of a LS430. plus, with the combined features of the ultraluxury package, which brings the total MSRP under $68,000- it's a much better overall value than a stripped MB S430 or BMW 745i. to be honest with you; the lexus is seriously the only comfortable car i feel driving. let me explain:

the Mercedes-Benz S-Class:
a beautiful automobile, in which i like TO BE SEEN driving, NOT DRIVING. acceleration is quite bad, and transmission jerky. power is not smooth at all. the interior (of the 2000-2002 models atleast) is filled with cheap-plastic materials. reliability is another issue; i have calculated the costs of repair for my S430 and it has totaled to approx $21,038.67 (thank goodness most of it was under warrantee). i mean, an S-Class is an S-Class. it's absolutely timeless, and is basically the best sedan you can get. but i just don't feel relaxed/comfortable behind it. sometimes, i think, well, i should have waited and have purchased a S500, or even S55 AMG. but i have driven the S500, and to be honest with you, i find the LS430 to drive just a well as a S500. i would have gotten the S55 AMG, if not for my wife, who has threatened to divorce me (she was kidding ;-) though) if i purchased one more ""sporty-car"". so i opted for a fully-loaded S430 instead. big mistake.

The BMW 745i/Li:
to be jonest with you, i wouldn't mind at all if i had gotten the 7-series instead. but when i test drive it, i always notice that the steering is way too loose; if i turn it a little, the car turns too much. i therefore do not feel in control of the vehicle. also, with the iDrive; it's a cute concept, and i like it, but after having used the MMI on the A8L, i think it is way too complicated. i finally ""mastered"" it after spending the ENTIRE day at my childhood friend's house (he has a drop-dead gorgeous new 760Li). but i must admit; the handling and performance truly exceed that of both the Audi and Lexus LS430. i thought i was in my SL55 (though not as fast).

The new 2004 A8L:
it's overall, the best car (out of the Audi, BMW, and MB) that fits me well. inside, the quality if PERFECT. i mean everywhere; take a look at the hydraullic hinge supporting the front hood. or the materials used inside; the wood, materials... although most people call it ""overly-conservative"" or ""boring design"", but to be honest with you guys; it's really quite beautiful; the lines are smooth, and there are no design areas that are controversial. on the contrary, i find that the A8L has the classic lines of a traditional luxury-sedan, with a splash of modernization. perfect balance. this was one of the major reasons why i did not decide to purchase another LS from lexus; so boxy and unimginative. but, the only reason why i am rather ""iffy"" on buying an Audi, is that i think that the name until recently was never as ""uber-sounding"" as the name 'Mercedes-Benz' 'BMW' or 'Jaguar'. Then, it made me feel, ""hey! if you pay ,less than $5,000 more, you can drive a Mercedes!"" or ""At the same time, I can drive a BMW flagship model. Why not?""

But, i guess seeing is truly beleiving. when i first saw the review @ edmunds.com, i though the A8L was as borring as ever, but after seeing it in person, I was truly impressed with Audi. (my daughter has a Audi TT right now and i am quite pleased in terms of fit-n-finish, performance, safety, and reliability.)

but then, after thinking it over, I can't help but say to myself: ""Come on... i'm driving a Mercedes-Benz S-Class, essentially the most luxurious and sought-after luxury sedan on the road. A Mercedes will always be a Mercedes.""

And you know what? Even after flipping through pages and pages of receipts from my dealership, showing problems that were fixed, issues that at first couldn't be resolved, that needed 1-3 months to be fixed, i then stare at the front of my car, then at the silver, star-

i chuckle to myself, smile, and then can't help but to take the S-Class out for a spin around town."
2501,"August 31, 2003 12:13AM",boo20,"If you're concerned about the reliability of MB you should not even consider an Audi. I would prefer a Lexus any day of the week even with its Amana refrigerator styling. Its not as if the styling of the big Audi is all that compelling anyway to justify the maintenance nightmares I have been reading about on this car.

The big BMW may be the 'ultimate driving machine' but its got a rear end that looks like an ethnic joke. Haven't sat in a 7 series lately but they have always made me feel clautrophobic and don't 'age' nearly as well as MBs do. Compare a 10 year old MB with a 10 year old BMW and you'll see what I mean. MB has always had the knack (as far as I'm concerned) of designing cars with lasting appeal. Even when I don't like the original design it usually 'grows' on me. ALthough the ML and SLK have been an exception to that rule.

I'll be trading in my E this fall for an S 500 4 matic. Audi, BMW and Lexus are not even on the horizon in my opinion."
2502,"August 31, 2003 9:33AM",i_drive,"this morning i took my son to his friend's house and while driving back, i got hit in the rear of the SL55 (only 3 weeks old). we pulled over immediately and inspected the damage:

1) Rear bumper dented in/out 2-3 centimeters on right/left side.
2) Paint damage/chip on trunk lid/lip
3) Trunk lid lip dented in approx. 1-1.5 centimeters
4) Undercarriage lopsided (right side collapsed, while left side still attached)
5) Cracked rear right taillight.
6) Don't think that power roof will close as the roof was open while driving, and the rear lid won't open.
7) slight ripple at the back of the trunk, and exhaust pipe damaged.

You will not believe what I was hit by:
a HUGE black Hummer H2. and what a coincidence: i happen to know his guy as he is one of the parents at my child's school.

overall, i was extremely surprised how much damage there as on the SL.

well he was extrememly apologetic about it. although the rear of my car was quite sad looking, the front of the Hummer was basically not-affected at all (you can see small scratches and paint chips here and there).

i was able to drive it to a nearby dealership and they have told me that i will have to wait approx. 1 month for new parts to come in, as well as an insurance agent to inspect the damage.

at first they offered me a C240 kompressor, but at the end, i got an ML320 loaner. a far cry from an SL, but i'm grateful that i did not sustain any injuries as we were going through stop-and-go traffic on a local street, and he accelerated and hit me at around 15-20 MPH.

my wife already told me, ""hahaha. told you not to get it. serve you right."""
2503,"August 31, 2003 9:49AM",boo20,MBs seem to sustain substantial damage on crash tests in minor 5 mph collisions. The engineers say that it is designed that way to absorb rather than transmit the shock to the cabin. I don't know. Good luck with your car.

 And lastly, I wouldn't call the S430 slow, by any means. But if you just got out of your SL, I would imagine anything would feel slow though."
2506,"August 31, 2003 7:50PM",i_drive,"i know. of all people, i happened to marry a woman who has absolutely no interest whatsoever in cars. (she always gets the new GX confused with the ML500, or the new Accord coupe with my SL. i am not joking at all). i had to fool (or trick) her into getting the Lexus on our anniversary by going to the dealership, asking to drive a demo GX, and at the end, i arranged the manager to offer my wife to bring it home for the weekend. when she bluntly said ""no"", he said ""too bad, here's the keys. it's yours."" (she was so attached to her Mercedes ML that seconds later, she was crying at the Lexus dealership, and everyone was staring at us)

is Audi really that bad? i guess seeing can be deceiving. i was truly impressed by the overall fit-in-finish of the A8L, TT, allroad...i knew that the older models of audi suffered significant reliability issues, but i thought that audi changed. my daughter's audi TT is working beautifully for her. i guess not.

300Eguy05:
i am planning on trading in the S-Class anytime now if i can get a good deal on a new good car. i used to own a '89 300E 2.6 Black Pearl metallic that was truly dear to me (actually my wife). that was my favorite MB that i ever purchased. it never failed her for the 10 year that we owned it, and boy, you should have seen her the day we traded it in for the ML320 (i thought our 14-year old family dog died).
it had 100,000 miles on it when the mileage ticker stopped working, so i estimate that it had about 115,000 miles when we sold it.
i am trying to find more pictures of the official refresh for the 2004 7-series. so far, based on what i have seen, i am not impressed. i actually think that the front headlamps do not look as dramatic as before; i liked the ""eagle-like"" look of the original headlamps more. the rear looks just the same. i don't know if the sources i went to were lousy, though.

my SL is in the body shop right now. i was informed that it would take a little over a month for new parts to come in. i told them to go a good job this time, as last time when my S430 was hit in the rear again, it took 2 months, and the entire lining of the trunk was loose, and a loud metal-against-metal sound could be heard in the rear seats. they have been unable to find the ""noise"" at the back.

I am also considering replacing the radio antannae. i don't know about other fellow 2000-2003 S-Class owners, but the FM, particularily AM reception stinks. all i really hear is static. the dealership (i have complained constantly to MB USA, and the dealership itself) apparently does not know what is wrong. they said the sameting when my gas gauge fluctuated between FULL and 1/4 within 2 minutes. they took out the entire dashboard, rear gas tank sensor, and all i know is that it still moves up and down (though not as badly), and as a result, there are more rattling noises BOTH near the instrument cluster and behind the rear headrests."
2507,"September 1, 2003 10:30AM",300eguy05,"Ah, yes the good old 300e. I have 150 thousandish miles on mine. Such a wonderful car to drive. I can't imagine trading it in for an M though! What a difference in those two cars.

I am sure you could get a good deal on a 2003 S. But, you might want to wait for the 2004. It gets the 7 speed tranny. But if that isn't important to you, just go for the 2003. Are you considering the 430 or the 500?

Audi and VW just aren't reliable. Audi has made the A8 attractive to more customers. But, they will never keep them if they can't grasp some quality control. It is a shame, really, because they make beautiful cars. Their interiors are top notch. And I wish that were reason enough to buy a car.

And, BMW. The 2004 7, should be changed in some areas. But I am not expecting anything durastic. Hopefully they will make the rear more attractive. Chris Bangle is walking on very thin ice right now. The 5 will be the true test of his fate with BMW."

The Alpina (with automatic tranny only)is the last incarnation of the low production Z8, so it seems that they will always retain some collectability and value."
2511,"September 7, 2003 9:46PM",merc1,"I dig the Crossfire, it provides some eye-candy for the road, something different to look at. I see boo20 corrected you about the opinion on the previous S-Class and the LS430. Basically you keep leaving out one very important word when that argument is raised...""poor"". The LS430 is a poor copy or imitation of the previous S-Class. Speaking of which, it isn't a mere coincidence that 04' LS430 has nearly the same tailamps as the 03' S-Class, wheels similiar to any number of Mercedes models and the front end has been reshaped to look like the current S, you know the car they couldn't copy back in 01' due to having set the design in stone to copy the previous S. I find this relentless copying or mimicing (insert the synonym of choice here) to be the most ridiculous spectical on the automotive landscape. BMW, Audi, Cadillac, Infiniti, Jaguar, and MB are able to do so much without looking like their nearest competitor.

About the Toyota Camry Solara. I find it most interesting that all the Lexus fans knocked Mercedes for making the CLK, SL and C-Coupe similiar looking from the front, yet Toyota goes and makes a Camry of all things look just like a 60K Lexus, which is supposed to be different ""brand"" unlike the C, CLK and SL which *should* look alike because their all ""Mercedes-Benzes"".

About Lexus detracters saying that Lexus cars have no character or emotion, it's pretty much true anytime you read any review of their cars, that is a ""universal"" opinion. See the SC430 comparo in the Oct issue of C&D. True, these are about the only major criticisms the Euro crowd can level at Lexus' cars...boring styling and uninvolving driving experience. The only reason Lexus fans find issue with Mercedes', or any other Euro brand's styling ""shouting"" anything is because Lexus' doesn't. What would be so terrible if Lexus made the LS430's styling match its other attributes? As far as Mercedes' image and what not, that surely isn't their fault if Lexus can't attain the same rub with people.

Ouch! This from the most conservative of all mainstream auto magazines!

It was comparing SC with SL500, 911, XLR & XK8. It says SC is the anti-Porsche: one never lets you forget you're in a car, one makes you forget you're in a car!"
2513,"September 8, 2003 7:13AM",ljflx,"You and I will simply have to disagree on a number of things. The 2004 LS430 has - in my opinion - only modest facelift changes over the 2003. The front headlights look - to me - very much like the old LS400 headlights and not at all like the new S. The taillight change is simply a stripe in the middle with no design change at all from the previous edition. Lastly I have always thought the LS was a classy elegant car from day one. I also think that now that the LS430 went back to a bit more LS400 front end look that it is even better looking than the 2001-2003 years. We just see different things. I don't see any copying whatsoever to the new S.

I think MB has made the Crossfire too much like a clk. It looks like an MB rather than a Chrysler. It was inevitable that the brands would mix at some point. The problem is that if they go too far in the mixing they may lose the more expensive MB buyers or entry buyers. If they do not go far enough Chrysler stays in a downward spiral. It's a daunting challenge and it won't be easy. I see that the Pacifica is already a rebate car.

Toyota should have made the Solara its own car. A stupid mistake in my opinion. On the other hand they may be planning changes for the SC so who knows. I can't argue with their great success.

As for passion it seems hard for people that read mags to understand that Lexus drivers have plenty of passion for driving hard. The cars they make are bred to be what they are though - silky smooth effortless cars to meet the driving needs of the road - not the racetrack. The guys who rate cars in magazines feel the same way about cars today as I did in my teens and early 20's. They have never changed so they simply don't see the desires people have moved on to. Once you get married and have an infant in that back seat you quickly change your perspectives about what is important in a car. We still like good handling as we get older (Lexus gives you plenty of it) and go through changes in our lives but a great ride, quiet interior and that silky smooth engine become equally if not more important. Lexus hits that spot better than any auto manufacturer which is exactly what they set out to do."
2514,"September 8, 2003 7:33AM",mariner7,"SC430 supposedly has backseats. Would anyone subject even a baby to it? I hope not, those backseats have zero legroom. SC is supposed to be a sporty coupe, and it wants the driver to feel as in a living room?

After much thought, I decided against getting another Q45, which will be much the same in 2004 as my 2002 version, so I looked around. I narrowed my choice to the '04 Audi A8L and the '04 Jaguar XJ series, but I briefly considered the BMW 745 too...

At first I was going to get an XJ8, since the new '04 XJ8's are really nice cars, especially at the $59,500 base price. I was surprised to find that the new XJ8 is quick, and handles extremely well. However, I ultimately gave in to the allure of the supercharged XJR, which can rocket from 0-60 in 5 seconds. Better yet,I am getting about 17.5 avg. MPG out of the supercharged 390 hp. V-8 engine because of the new Jag's light aluminum body and frame.

I should mention that I think that the Audi A8L is a beautifully executed vehicle. The build quality, and interior is the best I have seen...It is a great grand touring sedan, but it feels like a big luxury cruiser compared to the sporty quickness and acceleration of the XJR sedan."

What do you think of new 6 series? I think it's the Z4 frontend grafted to 7 series backend. Hideous! And believe or not, I'm partial to BMW."
2524,"September 8, 2003 1:35PM",ljflx,Best of luck with it. You got a great deal. How do you rate it vs your Q experience. Also what kept you away from the 745. I drove the A-8 and found the ride too harsh. One of these days I'm going to get around to driving the 745 though. A friend of mine who was in one said it had an excellent ride.
2525,"September 8, 2003 2:10PM",merc1,"Come on now the Crossfire looks like a CLK, but the new 04's LS430 doesn't take any styling cues from the current S-Class in it's facelift? Its a little bit hard to believe you really think something like that. One view is obvious and the other isn't even close. The LS430's tailights for example, why a clear lense treatment like the S-Class? It's ridiculous and was done for no other reason than to look like the Mercedes.

Chrysler and Mercedes ""mixing"" isn't going to cause MB to loose any buyers. In case you haven't noticed, Chrysler is using the old platforms from Mercedes, and the Pacifica isn't built on a Mercedes chassis. Chrysler is having the same problems they've always had, slow sales due to a bad reputation for quality in the recent past, and in the case of the Pacifica, it's pretty expensive for a Mopar product. So far they haven't done anything that a Mercedes buyer will care about. But you're right if they did the unthinkable and shared C, E and S-Class hardware with a Chrysler there will definitely be a problem.

As for the ""passion"" viewpoint...we should probably agree to disagree there too because you're still talking about a silky smooth ride as being something passionate. What you're talking about is your priorities (can't argue with those) when buying a car, not passion. If the LS truly had any of this (""passion"") you'd be talking about how it drives and feels compared to how it rides. I guess I can understand how you'd be passionate about a car, especially an expensive one like the LS430, but I can't see why. Why is it that a magazine only cares about a racetrack one minute (i.e. when they put a Lexus down), but in other instances when they don't like an A8 (C&D) they're oh so right about everything.

Now I see you and DonnFenn feel that Maxhonda nor I aren't allowed to discuss this because we don't own own a Benz or Lexus. When all else fails thats whats ususally said. I don't need to own a Lexus to know what kind of cars they are, or whether or not they appeal to me or any other person that calls themselves an enthusiast. I really don't need to own one to have an opinion on their styling either.

Even the NY Times auto section yesterday showed a front page picture of one with the headline ""Can you find the Mercedes in this picture"". Ordinary car buyers usually aren't sophisticated about platforms and the like. They look at something and draw conclusions from it. In the case of the Crossfire I'm sure they'll see an MB front-end in it - just like the Times did.

I never knocked the A-8. I drove it and experienced the harsh ride the reviewers talked about in the magazine. Thus all I said was I could confirm their experience. Inside that car is wonderful and outside I like its looks and it has the best paint I've ever seen on a car.

Now on the LS430 they wrap around the clear light panel in the tail light amd that makes it a copy of the new S. You are kidding I hope but even for you that is a very far stretch.

Lots of cars have big grillework today, Chrysler, Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Maybach, Jaguar etc. If a person can't tell a Crossfire from a Benz they're automotively challenged to say the least. The NY Times is NOT an automotive publication. You have the classic way of calling them ""autorags"" when they say unfavorable things about Lexus, only to say that they are right on the money when it comes to other cars and their faults. Thats a double standard.

Well let me as you this then...why do it if it looks like your main competitor? Its silly. The reason I came down so hard on the car is because someone across the street from me has a 04's LS430 with manufacturer plates on it, so I was able to get a good look at the car. If you honestly don't think the 04' model's changes aren't at least influenced by the S-Class, then we're much further apart in opinion than I ever thought possible in the what 4+ years I've known you. You nor any other Lexus owner, fan, supporter etc can come up with an functional reason why the LS430 has to take it's styling cues from the past and current S-Class cars. It's done to confuse the issue between the two cars. Again, I don't have to own any of the cars being discussed here to see them and comment on their styling, I didn't say anything about their technical status or other characteristics that would require me to actually own the car.

Benzowner,

The Pacifica is NOT built on a Mercedes platform, it's built on a version of their minivan platform, that platform being modified to the point of almost being all new. The Pacifica has nothing to do with any Mercedes.

2531,"September 8, 2003 8:08PM",ljflx,"I don't work for Toyota or Lexus so I don't need to defend them. Plus I think defending a modification to a tail light that is so incredibly minor would be crazy. But everything Toyota touches seems to turn to gold. They may not be the biggest auto manufacturer out there right now but they are the most profitable and the most powerful so they certainly know what they are doing. I'm glad I'm not competing with them.

Now the Times simply said - find the MB in the picture. I don't even remember if they said the Crossfire (to which they gave a positive review) looked like a CLK. But they put the accent on the front in the picture and all that was missing in my opinion was the 3 pointed star. I don't think the car looks like an MB from the side or rear and personally I think it looks awful from those views. I hardly take the Times word as gospel. They are the people that preferred a Maxima (the old one) over an LS430.

I haven't seen the 2004 LS430 yet. I was told they arrive on September 26 so needless to say I'm surprised you've already seen one. But I did get an advanced brochure in the mail and it looked like a modified 2003 to me. I didn't see any current S-class influence at all and in fact had to ask on the LS board what the change was to the tail light - to which lenscap, I believe - gave me the answer. So we do indeed see different things. Heck even a Benz owner said earlier he didn't see any similarities. I see a 2004 that looks like an awesome car and not one that took any cues from the current S-class.

I hope that car across the street is not going to haunt you."
2532,"September 8, 2003 9:24PM",merc1,"Oh I agree, Toyota is the most feared automaker around today, with their quality and production systems...they're pretty much unstopable. Everything they do doesn't turn to gold however, the current IS300, GS430 and others haven't exactly been a raging success. There are some on other boards who love to point out who dependent Lexus is on SUVs for sales, I don't really subscribe to that being a weakness because SUVs are hot, but it is true. Some companies are in better shape than others when it comes to competing against Toyota. What Toyota's Lexus will probably never do is create a following comprised of people who care about the other aspects of owning a car, besides reliablity and stereo systems. Believe it or not those things aren't the end all of car ownership, as European car popularity soars in this country. On paper a Lexus would be perfect if they added some excitement to the driving experience and styling. They more or less have stated that they intend to do just that. There is another NY Times article being discussed on the News and Views board that says that Lexus' VP said that BMW is now their target. You can imagine what the enthusiast crowd thinks of that one.

If you truly don't see where the LS430 has been influenced by the previous S-Class and the current one with it's 04's update then thats a wrap. I still maintain that there is no reason why a Lexus' tailights have to look like a Mercedes' when Audis, BMWs, Jaguars, Infinitis or Cadillacs don't. The whole theme of the car is that of a Mercedes, especially in the details like wheels, lights etc, I guess I don't see how anyone can not see this.

  I can agree with you about the LS looking similiar to the last generation S class. As much as this trend annoys me, I still have to agree with the others in saying that the current S class and the new 430 don't have similiar styling cues.

  While we're on this topic...Don't you all
think the exterior cues are converging across automakers? Footie posted a picture of a Ford Taurus and E class some weeks back, and there was some resemblance. With the exception of Jaguar, I don't really see a nice looking design out there.

MB used to make some awesome timeless designs with their SL and old S classes of the late 80's. Lexus' first designs (LS, ES, SC) were great, but they've resorted to ""borrowing"" styling cues from MB as of late. (With the exception of the RX). BMW's 7 Series isn't bad, but the back of it just looks too ""busy"" for me.. What do you all think?

I am not suggesting that Honda was out to do this, but since the wedge tail light design is a common theme, there are bound to be similarities in the way that many tail lights appear.

I do not see a physical resemblance between the Crossfire and the MB either. The silhouette, the front end, and the rear fascia are not the same. I doubt that anybody at Daimler Benz does either, as that was not their intention.

While the big Lexus may have originally been somewhat derivative of the MB, I do not think that folks at Lexus are currently trying to clone MB's in their styling studio. I also think that Lexus build quality on the LS 430 is better than the build quality of the recent S class generation.

BTW, I think one of the worst copy cat designs was the older Mitsubishi Eclipses, which look sort of like a Ford Probe or a mini-Firebird."
2538,"September 9, 2003 12:38PM",sv7887,"Don,
  
I've always felt the 1990-1994 LS was fairly original and a timeless design. You wouldn't look at it and think it was a MB. (That's why I still keep my '92), but over the years, they've definitely resorted towards taking cues from the S-Class. From the gated shifter to the profile of the Old S-class, Lexus hasn't been very original with LS430. Here's a quote from a Car and Driver Issue when the LS430 came out,

""It seems Lexus has fired the ""Seiko"" designers who designed the original LS, ES, and SC and brought in the Rolex knockoff artists""
  
 Before the Lexus owners on this board cry foul, I own 2 LS cars, a '92 and a '02 LS430. Even I have to admit, there is some truth to this quote. However, like most Lexus owners I feel I'm getting a higher quality car and a better ownership experience at a lower cost.

Most people my age don't care about 0-60 times, Indycar like handling and other sports car cues. The LS430 caters to the 45-50+ age group very well. They gave us a very comfortable car, with the latest in high tech wizardy and bulletproof reliability/service. And yes, if we want to pretend we're 20 again, we can stomp on the V-8 and get a very satisfying response..

All you Lexus owners, is the above a fair characterization of what we want?

Your thoughts would be appreciated,

OK, I am in that age range too, and I like my sedan, but I also like to drive it hard at those times when I have the open highway or a mountain road without traffic. Any of these cars, which offer a 0-60 time in under 6.5 seconds should feel quick and responsive when you stomp on it.

I felt that my '02 Q45 was quick enough to keep me ahead of the pack, but the XJR that I am now driving is a real thrill. There is something about driving a sedan that is faster than most sports cars, which makes me feel younger than I really am...LOL."

This theory about cars all starting to look alike for whatever reason is an excuse when it comes to the luxury class.

benzowner,

The link you posted doesn't work. However all new generation Chrysler products are going to share some Mercedes-Benz hardware, including the Pacifica. But there is a big difference in using a whole Benz platform, of which Pacifica does not. The Crossfire is the only one to do this, so far.

2542,"September 10, 2003 5:31AM",syswei,"I read the opinion somewhere, maybe on these boards or maybe in a autorag, that the SL takes some styling cues from Ferrari.

What do people think?"
2543,"September 10, 2003 6:42AM",ljflx,"Syswei - I think MB fans (not really the owners) want to think MB is nothing but original in everything they do. Now Merc1 thinks it is LEX people that want to draw comparisons to the Taurus and MB. But it is starting to be said in a number of places including the autorags that always seem to prefer BMW first and MB second.

Merc1 - two things:

One - there is a big difference between saying a car looks the same/copies another car vs saying it lifts a few styling cues from another car. I have no doubt that MB lifted some styling cues off the Taurus but that doesn't mean the two cars look alike as a whole. Plus - once they do it once they end up doing it three times because the C and E are replicas of the S. The Taurus with its revolutionary style 10 years or so ago bothered the Europeans because they thought they should have designed something like that first. You talk about the MB taillights as if they are sacred yet they have the same shape as those of a Taurus and that is just one of the similarities I see. Today the car that is bothering the Europeans - a lot from what I've been told - is the Cadillac Sixteen - another car they wished they had designed first. Let's see if they go in that direction in the next several years.

Two - It is inevitable that platform and part sharing between MB and Chrysler would develop and will now go deeper and deeper. It is the only way to justify the acquisition financially. They are in business to make money rather than please enthusiastic fans. They have two choices - cut costs via platform sharing which also lengthens the depreciable life of capitalized expenditures (sorry for the accounting jargon) or divest of Chrysler. Since they are already proceeding quickly (now) down the sharing path - after tons of infighting in the executive hierarchy about it - it's obvious there are no divestiture plans. That's business.

Finally I think the most original company out there is BMW. But the BMW and Jag grills always looked quite similar to me. I'm not really sure who got there first. As well the new 6 series looks like a Pontiac to me. Maybe it is impossible to design unique cars these days with all the brands and models that exist. Even the Maybach has a very Lincoln-like grill."
2544,"September 10, 2003 7:33AM",sv7887,"Don,
 You've illustrated my point. I don't think anyone who's driven a V-8 powered Lexus would call it sluggish in any means. Sure, the handling isn't indycar like, but who cares? It's not like we drive on the Autobahn everyday.

Of course this is an objective thing, and when you drive a Supercharged Jaguar, I can see why you'd want to step on it..One more question, how's the XJ treating you? Any of those new car gremlins Jaguar used to be known for? I'm thinking about getting a plain XJ within 2 yrs and that's the only thing that is holding me back.

Merc,
  Don't you think you're streching abit in saying the LS430 looks like a new S class? Your fanaticism is quite entertaining. Yes, I've seen the E class in person. and it does bear some resemblance to a Taurus. (I'm not saying the cars look EXACTLY the same here) If you were to tell me that the LS430 is borrowing it's cues from the OLD S Class I'll buy it.

Changing the marker lights to clear and extending the headlights makes the car look a little more aggressive. It's just a slight touchup. The RX and IS have clear lights too. Are they copying Honda? No...Don't tell me that MB is the first and only Automaker to put clear strips on their tailights..As for Lexus styling..

Okay, the LS takes cues from an OLD S class but what about the rest? The RX, ES, GX, GS, LX and SC are their own designs. While people say they're bland, they are still Lexus designs. The ES, GX, and RX don't borrow from anyone and they are the newest ones. I have no idea what the 2006 LS will look like, so the jury is out there.

Happy Motoring,

2545,"September 10, 2003 9:35AM",fenn,"These drawn out, highly subjective, debates over styling and it's lineage are beginning to seem more than a bit silly to me. I do not think that 2004 freshening of the LS430 was a deliberate Mecedes copying effort. To put such a focus on the Lexus' revised tail light lens seems a bit absurd. I walk away from debates over politics and religion at cocktail parties, and I am going to walk away from any debate over styling with a certain Mercedes fanatic.

As I mentioned earlier, take a look at the tail light lens of the newest Accord coupe if you want to see a Mercedes look-a-like. Was Honda trying to make the Accord coupe look like a Mercedes Benz....I do not think so.

sv7887:

I actually surprised myself when I began to consider the new Jaguar. Jaguars were never my interest, and the old XJ8 was too cramped for my 6'3"" frame. I initially only went to look at the '04 version as a curiosity seeker. Upon my first test drive, I was really impressed with base XJ8's feel and responsiveness at basic city driving speeds. To me, the base XJ8 felt more fun to drive than the base Mercedes S430, the BMW 745 and my former '02 Q45 in the normal 0 to 45 mile per hour city driving. The drivetrain and it's gearing offered responsiveness that felt great for such a big car. It felt quicker and smaller than it is.

Then I got seduced into going for the XJR after taking it on a test drive. The wonder of this car is that the drivetrain and six speed tranny make this car so driveable in city driving, but the Supercharger makes this thing scream when you need it. The power and handling set up went beyond any other sedan I have driven in this price range. Of course. the XJR is not cheap at $75k, but compared to the other cars in this class, it drives like a fast sports car. From it's performance stats, it is a better comparison to the much more costly Mercedes S55 and the big 12 cylinder Beemer...Although I think that the XJR is still a bit quicker than either of those cars too.

I am not yet sure how this car will hold up, but so far, so good..... Problems....? Well, my adaptive cruise just went inoperative, but that is a component issue. The dealer ordered a replacement cruise module. By the way, my father also just got a new XJ8 and his car is trouble free too...at this point. We shall see how they both hold up..."

I think that Audi executes some of the best designs, and their current interiors are the highest quality. The new A8 interior is close to perfection. I preferred it over my new XJR's.

By the way, Mercedes makes some great cars, and has been one of the most respected and hallowed automotive icons, but the concept that Mercedes has the holy grail and Lexus and all others are out to steal it, copy it, and clone it, is a bit overblown ----if you ask me."
2550,"September 10, 2003 1:30PM",syswei,"lenscap, the front end may indeed resemble the ES, but looking at the whole car, some in the trade press think MB is copying Jaguar. Here's a quote from AutoWeek: ""the CLS...is being referred to internally as a &#147;Jaguar-fighter,&#148; and designers are said to have borrowed much from Jag&#146;s overall design themes.

Don't give me the instance in which some woman off the street said something about the S-Class looking like a Taurus. Show me where a automotive writer has drawn such an conclusion. What magazine said this?

Your second paragraph about the Taurus is just your wild fantasy. Why in the world would European makers be upset by a mass-market car like the Taurus that doesn't even compete with them in any sort of way. Secondly, the Cadillac Sixteen isn't going to be built, nor has any European maker borrowed anything from it. No you always say that I'm just making things up, yet you have absolutely no basis for all this wild stuff you're talking about now. None.

What you'll never get is that Audi's A8, Jaguar's XJ and BMW's 7-Series don't look anything like each other. You haven't even seen the 04' LS430 in person yet right? How can you say it hasn't taken cues from the current S-Class, especially the 03' S-Class' facelift? You're right there is a definite difference between copying and borrowing details. The current LS430 is about as close to a copy of the old S-Class as legally possible. Now they've gone and slicked back the front and added clear sections to the tailights to resemble the current S.

You're right about something else, there are a lot of cars that end up looking similar, but when we're talking about a 20K compared to a 80K I'm more inclined to think that it's more of two companies thinking alike more than borrowing or even a sheer coincidence. You can't tell me for a minute that Lexus just accidently made the LS430 look like the old S and now by the same coincidence the 04' facelift just so happened to borrow from the S-Class, the car that is sole reason for the LS400/430's being.

It's amazing that one would see the resemblance between a Ford and Benz, but can't see it in Lexus' main reason for exisiting. Of course Mercedes isn't all original all the time, but they were a lot more so before someone began copying any and everything from them. Truth be told the only brand the lacks originality in the luxury market now is Lexus, they've admitted as much and have stated that a family look is coming for all their cars. It's about time. The sole reason that copying is dismissed because it's Lexus thats doing it, but yet a Benz looks like a Ford and thats news. But you're right the copying issue is done so we'll just have to agree to disagree as we have over the past 4 years and move on. Lets talk about something else.

Oh and you're going to love this, I hate the CLS. It doesn't look like a Mercedes at all, it's horrible.

sv7887,

I'm done with that issue after this post, but to answer to some of your questions see above post to ljflx.

DonFenn,

As for the taurus/sixteen comment - let's just say that I hobnob with high level European execs who sit on supervisory boards and who have connections to the auto industry there and I will leave it at that.

S55's are cool cars. And, for the huge added cost of an S55, it certainly should smoke an XJR ---but it does not.

You haven't even seen the 04' LS430 in person yet right? What you got from a conversation with someone is oh-so important and more importantly true, but nobody else is allowed to draw any conclusions about something they can actually see. For the record I see one Benz owner saying anything different from what I said, unlike more Lexus fans who don't seem to be in as big a state of denial.

DonFenn,

You stated that you thought the XJR was faster than the S55, and I said that the XJR would get smoked in that reguard and it does. ""I wish that some people would look at the stats, before overstating their opinions."" Thats exactly what you should have done.

The facts:

Mercedes-Benz S55 AMG: 493hp, 516lb-ft of torque, 0-60 mph: 4.6 secs.
Jaguar XJR: 390hp, 399lb-ft of torque, 0-60 mph: 5.0 secs.

These are purely from MB's and Jaguar's websites. The XJR has actually been tested by Road and Track and it took 5.1 secs to get to 60 mph, the current S55 has yet to be tested, but if the similarly powerful S600 is any indication the S55 will do the same feat in about 4.4 secs or faster. Lets not even discuss grip, and passing and 1/4 mile performance, the Benz will crush the cat. Performance wise the XJR is indeed toast. The only area the XJR might outperform the Benz is in braking, due to it's brilliantly light (lighter than the A8 too) construction. That said it's still a great car and a bargain compared to a S55 or 760Li, but those cars do outperform it.

M"
2565,"September 12, 2003 6:43AM",ljflx,"Ridiculous. It's as if we are talking about eyelashes on a person. I have seen more than enough pictures of the car and I had a hard time seeing any changes in the tail light in the first place.

That's it for me on this silly taillight discussion."
2566,"September 12, 2003 6:43AM",syswei,"If we're going to pay attention to tailamps, what about headlights?

The LS went to a clear cover/reflective silver inside with its headlights in 1998. MB did this with the S I believe in 2002 or 2003 (earlier in the S's life they were more whitish/less transparent when viewed from the outside). Does this mean MB ""copied"" Lexus? If I were as fanatic about Lexus as some here are about MB, I would say definitely, and call anyone who disagreed with me blind or worse.

But actually, I'm not a fanatic. I only bring headlights up in the context of the tailamp silliness."
2567,"September 12, 2003 6:48AM",lenscap,"Actually, with the LS taillight it seems Lexus is just repeating something they've done before. In 2000 they changed the taillight on the ES 300 so that the orange portion became clear.

Further, if memory serves correctly I believe it was Toyota that first used clear turn signals (instead of orange) on taillights back in 1988 with the Supra."

Not to get off topic, but I do miss Seinfeld a lot. Speaking of cars, what about the episode where Kramer accidentally got the wrong license plate and put it on his car (A**MAN).

And speaking of Seinfeld, I saw part of a show on E! the other night with cameramen videotaping celebrities. They caught up with Jerry and his dead Porsche which eventually had to be towed. The same thing happened to another celebrity and her Porsche on the same show (I can't remember her name) and the announcer said something like ""So much for German engineering."""
2574,"September 12, 2003 11:30AM",ljflx,"That was one of my favorites. In fact it was just on last night.

Now how's this for an episode. Kramer hits lotto and buys an LS430. George inherits his parents money and buys an S-500. Jerry has married Elaine and drives a 745LI. Kramer who always drove bombs is not used to the exceptional brakes in an LS430 and stops short at a traffic light which had just turned yellow. George who is used to his S-500 plows into him and wrecks his taillights. Jerry is behind them with Elaine but looks at a beautiful girl on the sidewalk (hey remember that one with the heir to the O'henry fortune) and plows into George wrecking the Benz taillights. They bring the cars over to David Puddy - who now owns a body shop - who proceeds to put the Benz taillight on the Lexus and the Lexus taillight on the Benz creating a big fight between George and Kramer not to mention a huge debate and argument on various Edmunds boards. Naturally Steinbrenner calls George on his cell inviting him back for an exec job, NBC calls Jerry to resurrect the Jerry show and Elaine files for divorce. Kramer - who knows - he's capable of anything. The show closes with Newman pulling up to his mansion in the suburbs in his Rolls Royce taking the mail out of his mailbox.

2577,"September 12, 2003 12:28PM",ljflx,Yep that was the A--MAN episode - also known as the FUSILI JERRY episode.

2578,"September 12, 2003 12:30PM",fenn,"Thanks for the levity with the Seinfeld stuff. We need a bit of levity around here. Some people take themselves too seriously.

Merc1:

So, you like to use strong words regarding a comparison of the XJR's performance vs the S55....It is my opinion that you are wrong, and go way overboard by using terms like ""smokes the XJR"" ""crush the cat"" ""its no contest"" ..etc. I get a kick out of your exaggerations and overstatements.

So, I felt compelled to grab a couple of quotes from recent ""Road and Track"" and ""Car and Driver"" magazines to answer your comments. I do not agree with everything that I read, and I am not saying that automobile jounalism is beyond reproach, but their credentials are a bit more discernable than yours..........

So, here is a quote from Car and Driver's August issue about the XJR: ""That puts the car (XJR) right into the hunt with the Mercedes S55 AMG and BMW 760Li, at a base price&#151;$74,995&#151;that's $30,000 to $40,000 lower than those esteemed models'""........

And, Road and Track's August issue says: ""A check of our Road Test Summary shows the XJR handily out-classing our ""Five-Star Sedans,"" the Audi S8, BMW 740i and Mercedes-Benz S55 AMG comparison-tested in November 2001. The Mercedes-Benz S55 was the quickest of this trio, but the XJR beats it by a bunch: 5.1 seconds to 60 versus the S55's 5.7. The Jag reaches the quarter mile in 13.5 sec. at 105.9 mph versus the S55's 14.1 at 102.7.""....

I think that for the XJR to be in ballpark with the S55 at such a huge differential is impressive. Apparently, there is little debate about that with most folks.

As a luxury car driver and consumer, I recognize the value... and the performance that it buys. As a self-proclaimed expert, you apparently march to your own drummer...

By the way, I could buy a couple of spare Mitsubishis for less than this price differential...Does that illustrate the XJR vs S55 value issue for you?"
2579,"September 12, 2003 12:34PM",sv7887,"Hi All,

Having the S55 beat the XJR by 0.4 of a sec is hardly ""burning"" it. As far as the other specs, that's what they are mere numbers. I seriously doubt anyone who owns these cars are going to race them.

Those stats are merely tibits for the bull sessions drivers of these cars engage in. I doubt they translate to driving on the Interstate for example. Anyone attempting to realize the full potential of their cars is likely going to get pulled over for their trouble. (At least in MA anyway)

Considering the XJ is $30K (Correct me if I'm wrong) cheaper than the S55 those stats are pretty good.

Besides, there has to be alot of fun had at preying on unsuspecting Mustang and teenage drivers at stoplights, who mistake the Jaguar XJR as an old people's car LOL..XJR owners, have you had any experiences like this? :P

Happy Motoring,

2. The S lights don't extend partly onto the trunk, whereas the LS clearly do.

3. As someone else posted, the S has FOUR clear strips, the LS only ONE.

4. Per lenscap's post, Lexus put a clear strip on the ES taillight in 2000, and Toyota did it with the Supra in 1998. So was MB first?

5. LS's taillights are predominately red. Oh my gosh, they must be copying MB!

We made this same agreement a couple of months ago, y'know...

It is always interesting to me how sometimes a post fervently pursues some sort of beaten-to-death issue and then closes with words to the effect of ""now we should stop talking about it.""

The way to ""stop talking about it"" is to stop talking about it. Expressing further thoughts about an issue invites others to make their counterpoints. Closing an opinion-filled post with ""we need to stop talking about it now"" is fruitless. What has happened is that the poster has said ""I've had my say and you don't get to have yours."" Why would anyone accept that?

Continuing to argue ""your side"" continues to invite others to argue ""their side."" We are discussing opinions here, folks. Opinions are not something that can ever be objectified.

2594,"September 13, 2003 9:04AM",pablo_l,"At some point in time, the advantages of such hyper-high performance numbers can result in liabilities when it comes to ride quality and overall balance. The real advantage of that might, just might, become more obvious in Autobahn-Land as you accelerate from 130mph to 155mph+ after being caught behind a mere mortal standing in your way. For 0-60, and especially everyday driveability, you get into diminishing results. Reinforced drivetrains to handle 500hp and 19-inch wheels will seldom result in a smooth ride when the going gets choppy, which is the case all too often in (let's admit it) rather poorly maintained US roads (Californians are especially hard hit).

The XJR strikes a great balance: it is never harsh, it has performance to reshape your eye- and any other ball-shaped objects in your anatomy, and due to its class leading weight you don't have to go for one of those offensive mpg figures that often come as a pentalty with very high performance. I know my XJR (older model) often would not make it beyond 14mpg, which makes me uncomfortable, even though I am not missionary when it comes to others chosing it - more power to them, literally.

So it boils down to what it always is: different value propositions. The S55 seduces with sheer numbers, and we all know there's a great brag value in that, but in best Jaguar tradition the XJR goes merely for elegance and balance, and regards anything that is too extreme (hard to say in a 300++HP package) as rather vulgar.

Sure, the S has a 20% advantage in horsepower and 10% advantage in 0-60 times (Autobild numbers, which are very consistent). Then again, the 18% disadvantage in heft leads to a 38% disadvantage in mpg (there a square law in physics there, remember), which can hover around under 13mpg for long stretches according to tests. Personally, I think balance typically leads to more satisfying long term satisfaction in cars. (Actually, I found the older generation XJR too radical for me after 2 years...)"

You hardly know that the supercharger is there when you are stuck in stop and go traffic, or running around the corner to pick up groceries...But, when you need it, this thing can respond like a monster.

I find it really remarkable that Merc1 now wants to pick a 12 cylinder, 125k car (S600)to compare to a $75k car. Or, he uses the latest numbers of a much smaller E55 in his comparison.

Merc1 lets come back to a real-life value comparison: Compare the similarly priced S430 or S500 at their real ""price point"" to a 75k Jaguar XJR. The XJR leaves the S430 in the parking lot, and the S500 has to work very hard to play with the XJR. No contest.

DonnFenn - That has always been the problem with Merc1. Price doesn't enter into the equation for him and that is totally illogical. I have that same problem with auto reviewers. They penalize a car for being the highest price in their ratings summary and don't take into consideration that if the price is levelled all the performance goodies they love come off the car."

For example, I actually had a deposit down to buy one of the first Minis when they came out - I loved the design and was sure it'd be a blast. Read the reviews, and they were utterly gloving, I could hardly wait. The I took a test ride on the S with the sports package, and I could not stand it. The ride was utterly jarring over Bay Area roads, which contain a generous amount of potholes, and the test car was squeaking out of every corner after 3k miles due to the abuse those sharp jolts had transmitted to every piece of the car.

I never ever said that the XJR wasn't a bargain compared to the S55, but you stated initially that the XJR was faster than the S55 and that sir is simply not true. I used the S600 as an example because the current S55 and S600 have the same hp ratings, with their only difference being torque (516lb-ft for the S55 compared to 590lb-ft for the S600) and weight...the S55 being lighter by 300lbs. It seems that since your 01' S55 data was out of date you're now comparing the XJR to the S430 and S500, neither of which compete with the XJR for sporting rights, knowing that there would be no contest there anyway. No where in my statements did I ever mention the S600 as a direct competitor to the XJR, I only used it as a performance reference, due to very similar power. You've turned the whole thing back around to a value question, of which I wasn't even contesting, it was the sheer performance of the two cars that was in contention. The S55 outperforms the XJR Don, all the value aside for a momement, wasn't performance the topic of dissussion here? The S500 and S430 aren't performance models, the S55 is, the car you mentioned. Since the current data doesn't support the XJR you're now saying they don't compete because of price, after supporting the magazine quotes saying that they do.

michael_mattox,

""There are a number of factors other then HP that influence 0-60 and 1/4 mile speed tests...""

You missed the whole point, which was that just by looking at the raw data on the two cars, you'd be able to see that one car should and does easily outperform another. Are you telling me that anything otherwise is possible between these two cars? What factors are going to be present to prevent the 493hp S55 from soundly beating the 390hp XJR at the track? You're right numbers do matter, and they would prove that the S55 outpeforms the XJR.

It seems we aren't ever going to see eye to eye on anything, when I can admit things about reliability and price, but you guys aren't even willing to admit the obvious here: the XJR is clearly outdone performance wise compared to the S55. I'm done with this one, since we aren't going to use the facts.

I just went by the information and views that I found expressed in the recent automotive media. I also went by my own impression as a real buyer and shopper for my next car.

I actually test drove an S55 and and XJR within an hour of each other last month. They felt equally fast, but I did not take either car to the dragstrip for timing trials. For my ""real life"" driving, and ownership criteria,the XJR felt great, and felt sportier (maybe because of it's light weight) .... for $30k less money. Does that much $$$ mean anything to you, Merc1?

It is one thing to be an opinionated observer and commentator without regard to price. It is another to be a bona fide driver who has to deal with the price/benefit ratio. Some folks are car ""fans"" that seemingly aspire to convince the rest of us to agree with them. Others among us, are actually car owners in this luxury class, and we may have more pragmatic views."
2601,"September 13, 2003 2:20PM",merc1,"Of course price means a lot Don, the only thing I was speaking out against was the notion that the XJR was faster than the S55. Thats all. The other merits of the two cars can be debated forever, as they both are great automobiles. The fact remains that I like the new XJ a lot and find it be a screaming bargain on the part of a European manufacturer, especially the top-line XJR which cost less or the same as the entry level cars from Audi, Mercedes and BMW.

I wasn't trying to convince anyone to agree with me on anything, I was merely tryig to point out the facts about the performance of the two cars.

2602,"September 13, 2003 2:37PM",pablo_l,"""Performance"" can mean a number of things. If mileage matters to you, then mpg becomes one performance criteria. If the word performance is thrown about without further qualifiers, you will be having silly discussions with people that associate entirely different notions with the word.

Even the S55 comes at a very significant price premium over the XJR, so no, I don't think it is a natural comptitor because it happens to be the performance model. Price wise, the XJR offers itself to people that might be considering indeed the S430 and S500. Most car buyers first establish the price bracket they go for, and which cars fall into that category.

Furthermore, the Merc versions with the additional umph are rather recent, and there are still several 350HP S55s in dealers' lots. Those certainly can not dream of outperforming an XJR."
2603,"September 14, 2003 2:34PM",syswei,"I postulate that there are reasons that the autorags (and some of the more vociferous voices on this board) tend to under-rate value as part of the equation that real, cash-paying BUYERS use in evaluating cars.

Reason one might be, these test drivers / writers / editors aren't shelling out their own, hard-earned cash. They're just driving around for free.

Reason two might be, that at least when it comes to high-end cars, only a relatively small proportion of the reader base is actually ever going to buy at the high end. For instance, Ferrari has sold 818 units in the US year to date, compared to Car & Driver's paid circulation of 1,387,113 (and it's ""total audience""...whatever that is...of 9,898,000). In other words, most people reading about high end cars in the autorags are to a large extent dreamers that are never going to be in a position to actually pay for such a car. So they don't care too much about price either; the autorag reviewers understand this and cater to the dreamer.

So it should come as no surprise that the autorags will tend to side with a car that might be marginally ""better"" in some respects...even if it costs 30, 50, 100% more. Price and value just aren't that important to dreamers (unless the price is low enough to bring the car into reality-land for the reader). The dreamer is going to want to hear about ultrafast accelaration, ultrafast topend speeds, skidpad results, etc.; consideration of quality, reliability, and value are pretty boring reading for the dreamer."
2604,"September 14, 2003 5:12PM",scottphillip,"I drove to Jacksonville, Florida yesterday. My first stop was the Audi dealership. They didn't even have one new A8L on the lot. So I headed on over to the Jaguar dealership where there were several 2004s. I drove a Vanden Plas. It handled very well. The power was OK. There were no XKRs in stock. A ""base"" model is certainly a bargain at $59,000. I am surprised that xenon lights aren't standard. The interior has an elegant simplicity.

I am looking forward to driving the Audi. Shopping for a new car is my hobby."
2605,"September 14, 2003 10:04PM",300eguy05,"I too drove the XJ this weekend. I chose to drive the VP, and I was amazed how light it felt. I thought it was quick on it's feet as well.

I was a bit put off by the sheer size of the A8. Michael Audi had one on the lot. It was Grey. The color was very nice. It did not feel as quick as the cat, but it was quick enough. You have to remember I am used to a 300e. All of the cars were 'quick' imo.

Then I made my way over to Mercedes of Fresno. I drove an S430, and was impressed with it, because it was some what familiar. It felt like a Mercedes and it drove like a Mercedes. I am still undecided..."

2607,"September 15, 2003 11:21AM",fenn,"300eguy05 and scottphillip:

I was originally very excited about the new A8L when I started my shopping. Even though I did not buy the Audi, it is still my favorite with respect to it's interior. I also respect the attention to details that Audi lavished on this car....In that regard, I consider it the best in this class.

However, after a couple of test drives I characterized the car as the ultimate luxurious cruiser, rather than sporting sedan. It felt a little too big for my needs. While it is only about 5"" longer than my XJR it just feels like a much bigger car to me.

Of course, since Audi built the A8L as a big luxury sedan, this is not a negative comment. For people that are looking for a commodious, large, luxury car the A8L is hard to beat.

Had Audi brought the standard wheelbase A8 into the U.S. market,it might have fit my needs better.

In about six months, Audi will be bringing the new version of the S8 to the U.S. to meet the needs of a true high-end sporting sedan. I think this will be a really hot car....but it will probably be an $85k+ vehicle."
2608,"September 15, 2003 11:39AM",ljflx,I read somewhere - I believe in one of the auto mags but I'm not sure - that Audi is not going to bring the S8 into the US anymore because there was virtually no demand for the car.

2610,"September 15, 2003 2:02PM",adob,"Is there anyone on this board that has a current model BMW 7 series (for 3+ months) that has not had any severe maintenance issues? I look at the edmunds ratings for BMW (7 specifically, but all models generally) and they seem to evoke either great marks, or really bad marks - especially in reliability. I have read the many horror stories and wonder whether those giving the 7 series high ratings actually owned their cars for any amount of time, or are the 10's in reliability just the first week of ownership excitment, before the trouble really begins.

I am looking for an 04 LS, Q, or 7 - the 7 excites me, but the Germans are not really up to par (own 2 MB's) on quality, and BMW seems to enjoy Yugo type quality. Actually surprised I don't hear it in the mainstream press...."
2611,"September 15, 2003 2:25PM",pablo_l,"I think the bad ratings from the 7 series come from people who get remorse because either they get tired of jabs about the design or because the intrisuve user itnerface gets on their nerves.

2614,"September 15, 2003 3:47PM",fenn,"My XJR is actually at the dealer today to have the defective adaptive cruise module replaced. They ordered the part a couple of weeks ago, and I just got around to taking it back in for the repair. My car also has a very minor interior trim flaw on the console, but Jaguar has issued a factory repair bulletin for this repair on some early '04's. Other than this, the car seems very solid. No squeaks, rattles, or quality issues. My father has not had any problems to date with his '04 XJ8.

I really liked my 2002 Q45, but it is not a fair direct comparison to the XJR which costs about $15,000 more, and has about 50 more horsepower, along with bigger tires, wheels, and brakes.

As a competitor to the more basic Jaguar XJ8, the Infiniti Q45 is certainly worthy, although the XJ8 feels a bit more athletic to me, maybe because of it's light weight and responsive six speed drivetrain.

To tell you the truth, I do not really miss the so-called ""tech"" stuff of the Infiniti. Beyond the novelty of the voice activation, the logic of Q45's dash cluster was not particularly intuitive when handling a/c and audio controls. However, I do miss the tire pressure monitor, which the XJR lacks.

I have the Jaguar Navigation option, with it's touch screen on the XJR (an option on all XJ models). This system is very straightforward and logical...I find it more intuitive and easy to use than the Infiniti's dash pod and switch-gear.

I still think that the Q45 is a great car, especially for the money, if you can get a great lease deal, since the resale is not good.

I also think that a base XJ8 is priced well, since the basic XJ8 is actually priced closer to the Q45 than it is to a basic Mercedes S430 or BMW 745."
2615,"September 15, 2003 4:10PM",adob,"MAxHonda - sorry about the Yugo comment - certainly don't mean to offend... I really was trying to solicit current owners. If you read the ratings, here and the many other forums google picks up, people have had horrific experiences with mechanical and computer glitches on the 7 series. You can almost feel their pain from their postings. Dealer visits ever 3 weeks, bad service, shop stays for weeks, cars returned not fixed etc... etc... it just seems to go on and on. I was just wondering, whether there truly was a current 7 series customer, that has owned their car for a while, where these problems were overblown/non-existant (I really want to believe these cars are good). Of course there are positive postings, but I was trying to discount those who just came home with their brand new car, and immedietley rated it a 10 in quality/mechanicals. I saw too many ""just got mine yesterday"" postings with 10 on every rating item. I love the look and tech of the 7, just don't want to make the $70k mistake, especially with adequate warning from others.

So to restate, has anybody had a GOOD several months with the new 7 series - mechanical and computer??"
2616,"September 18, 2003 2:42PM",fenn,"My '04 XJR had to sit at the dealer for an extra day and a half because of the complexity of the programming and set up of the adaptive cruise module which was replaced. I think that my car may have been one of the first in the U.S. to have the adaptive cruise changed out, and the programming required Jaguar Tech Support....

The good news is that they felt bad about the delay in getting this done, so they gave me a new XJ8 to drive for two days. That gave me the opportunity to spend some time behind the wheel of the '04 XJ8.

I have to say that I was really impressed. At low speeds the car felt similar to the XJR except for a slghtly lighter steering feel. Even without the XJR supercharger, the car felt quick and responsive.

Last night, I got the opportunity to push the XJ8 on a curvey canyon road. Sure, I felt more body sway and it was less ""grippy"" than the XJR, but it still hadled really well..I must admit it felt lighter and more athletic than my '02 Q45.

At one point I started to realize that I probably could have been happy with an XJ8--- for way less money than my XJR.....

Of course, that was until I went back and picked up my XJR and pushed the accelerator pedal to the floor....Yowza!"
2617,"September 18, 2003 5:45PM",syswei,"Over the months I&#146;ve read from some of the MB fans that Lexus is a slouch at performance compared to MB, that for example engines of a comparable displacement will have less hp, less torque if from Lexus. For all that time I accepted this as true.

Well I decided to check the facts for the LS430 and S430

HP: LS430 290, S430 275

Torque: LS430 320 lb-ft, S430 295

0-60: LS430 6.3sec, S430 6.9

These numbers are from the company websites for 2003 models. For 2004, the LS gets a new transmission and Lexus puts the 0-60 time at 5.9. MB gets a new transmission too so its acceleration will improve also, but my guess is Lexus will still beat them."
2618,"September 18, 2003 7:45PM",ljflx,"Having driven both cars several times in 2001 I can tell you the LS430 easily outpowers the S-430. It is very noticable in torque. You need the S-500 for this to be a real battle. In handling the S-430 outhandles the LS430 but the euro suspension LS430 - which remember is the same price as the LS430 as it is equipped 75% of the time - will put away the S-430 and the S-500. Now MB fans will cry foul and say that the S-class sport will take out the LS430 Euro (or sport as it is now called) and it probably will but that car is not the at the same price point as the base cars. Lexus never intended to compete with the European sportier suspensions. Rather its' intentions were to provide a suspension to the car - without much ride compromise - that would surpass the handling of the base S-class cars thereby appealing to customers who might not shop for an LS. I drive the Euro often as my business partner has one and it handles and rides beautifully. I am very curious to drive the 2004 LS430 sport suspension with the 18"" wheels as I am leaning in that direction when my lease is up."
2619,"September 19, 2003 7:23AM",scottphillip,"Don,

Thanks for keeping us posted on the Jaguar. I am hoping to drive the A8L this weekend.

I was looking at the Mercedes message boards here, and was shocked to see all of the owners' complaints. S-class (command system) and E-class electrical bugs. I have had a deposit on an SL for one year, but I think that I am going ask for its return. I am #92 on the list.

I really enjoyed my 2002 LS430 Ultra, and may end up getting another one if I like the 2004. The Lexus may not be the most exciting car to drive, but I think that its reliability and luxury make it a rewarding ownership experience."
2620,"September 19, 2003 9:03AM",fenn,"You do not need to apologize for the thought of getting another LS430. Most of the Lexus naysayers who have commented here are Mercedes idealists. They have not been drivers or owners of these cars.

I think that the updates and tweaks on the '04 will make the LS430 a quicker car, and the styling chages, while subtle, make the car's looks freshened. Furthermore, your past experience as a satisfied Lexus customer means a great deal."
2621,"September 19, 2003 9:52AM",michael_mattox,In fact I have asked the biggest Merc supporter on these boards if he has ever driven an LS430 and his silence would indicate he has not.
2622,"September 19, 2003 11:14AM",ljflx,"Try out that LS430 sport suspension model. In 2004 they have it coupled with a modern luxury option package that looks like a very well balanced car. It may be short of the ultra on options but it trades off the sportier ride for it. I found that the handling with the sport suspension was better than that on the ultra in sport mode. I couldn't discern any difference in ride quality so the improved handling doesn't compromise the ride - at least in the 2001-3 model years.

DonFenn - Perfectly stated."

2625,"September 20, 2003 8:17AM",merc1,"I wouldn't bother to go on about it, as the new rules dictate that you have to own whatever car to discuss it in here now. Even with things like styling and performance you have to own it to understand, reguardless of whether or not you can actually ""see"" the car on the road or at a showroom or autoshow or have driven one. When it comes to performance the rules change depending what car is being discussed, and which car is shown to be more favorable....if it's the wrong way around, other factors come into play to even things up, reguardless. Either way you can't debate it here.

You're a basher when you don't agree, but when you do agree you're the most knowledgeable person around. Car magazines are so right when they say this, but when they say that, they're idiots.

Then you have those who don't understand any data unless it's in survey form, so talking performance or any other non-JDP covered issue with them is moot, because unless JDP covers it, it's worthless.

Now because you've come to a non-brand specific forum to discuss (with an opposite viewpoint) a car, or a different view you're in need to justify your purchase, like thats the same as if you were to call anyone ""not-smart"" or worse in the past because they didn't consider brand x first before chosing brand y.

So they own a Lexus for 2-3 years then buy the Mercedes, Jag, BMW, Land Rover, whatever.
next time around it is something different.
Their income is sufficient enough to where it is not really that important.
They may go back to the Lexus because it is cheaper to own.
Although I suspect that all of their cars never go out of warranty so they never find the true cost of ownership.

For me, my time is valuable. I will not continue to go back again and again for problems that are engineering related and probably unfixable.
My Oldsmobile dealer could have cared less if he fixed my car and my current Chevrolet is having issues which cause me to question it's long term operating expense.

My next car will be a used Lexus LS 400. End of story.
There will be no BMW or Mercedes in my driveway because I am scared of what it may do to my pocketbook.
I would guess that even the Mercedes supporters on this thread would agree that a Lexus is cheaper to own in the long term.

Not a 1981 300D Turbodiesel. LOL.

Where did anyone ever say this? I'd like to see that claim. Even you, I see can tell by the sheer stats alone that the LS430 has the advantage performance wise over the S430, yet just a little while ago the same type of comparision was made between two different cars with a much wider gap in their ""stats"" and the advantage took forever to be seen, (if at all by some) simply because I'm not an ""owner"" so anything factual (that doesn't require ownership) is invalid.

2633,"September 20, 2003 3:31PM",boo20,"Actually the only area in which I have consistently faulted (""bashed"" if you will) Lexus is in styling. I totally agree that Lexus is more reliable. Repeatedly so. It is probably a ""better value"" than an S class but when compared to, say, an E class the differences are much closer. I know that for many years Intellichoice has chosen the E class as the best overall value when considering depreciation, insurance, repairs, gas milage etc. i.e, the total cost of ownership. (I don't know about their most recent choices).

Let me address, once again, the issue of reliability. My personal experience is that these cars are reliable (though, admittedtly, not bullet proof like the Lexus). I have had a few problems but this may mean I make one extra visit to the shop per year compared to what a Lexus might make. Not a huge difference. As I've said before the service intervals for MB are 10,000 miles and one year on average (sometimes longer) whereas for Lexus it is 5000 miles. So I save one extra scheduled maintanence per year which, for me, makes up for the extra visit for the occasional electrical problem that may arise. It is true that a small number of MBs seem to be plauged by problems and I think that this skews the statistics and makes the entire brand seem more unreliable than it actually is for most of the owners. MB lacks the consistency in reliabilty that I admire in Lexus.

I also appreciate Lexus for providing competition in the luxury car segment (and you should appreciate MB for the same reason as well)Otherwise we would all be paying much more for our cars than we currently are if someone had a monopoly."
2634,"September 20, 2003 3:35PM",carnaught,Your last point is well taken. I have always believed and pointed out that the competition between these (Lexus vs. MB) and other marques has made each a better car.
2635,"September 20, 2003 4:03PM",fenn,"At one level, or another, all of the other luxury manufacturers used Mercedes as their target, whether they emulated the style, or coveted the high position that Mercedes has in the automotive market. I doubt that there is any argument about that here."
2636,"September 20, 2003 4:18PM",syswei,"To my personal tastes, I also find Lexus weak on styling. I think the LS is the least-attractive looking car in its class, actually. It is very likely my next car nonetheless, because exterior styling just isn't that important to me (others may differ). I have said before, maybe on the Lexus vs MB board: how much time do I spend looking at the outside of the car I own, as opposed to the time spent actually driving?

Maybe if I were single, and impressing the ladies with better exterior styling and a 3-pointed star were important, things would be different for me."
2637,"September 20, 2003 4:36PM",ljflx,"The problem with the E has always been a simple one for me. It's the size of a Camry and thus I couldn't fit my family into it comfortably. Plus I found it too small for me as a driver. Therefore no matter what anyone says about it from a value standpoint it never makes my short list in the next 5-7 years. It's too small and not in the same league of luxury as the LS, S, 7, A8, XJ or the Q in my opinion. It's a very good car, definitely sportier and a better handler than an LS but it doesn't meet my needs or requirements. If it was just my wife and I or if we had just one child I'd give it a lot of consideration."
2638,"September 20, 2003 5:30PM",b4z,"Re: Audi A8
Just saw a review on Motorweek or Spike TV. Can't remember which.
Check your local listings, it will be re-aired.

I was very surprised how negative the review was.
They said that the ride quality was not good at all and that bumps sent loud shocks into the cabin.
They also felt that it was slow and that the 0-60 time was only 6.4 secs. I don't know how you feel but, 6.4 secs is pretty quick to 60.

They really hammered it on the weight.
Said at 4400 lbs it was heavier than the last gen car and the heaviest aluminum bodied car they had tested. It really seemd to bother them a lot.

Only thing they liked about the car was the interior. Which is terrific.

i have never been in an A8 but have always heard that the ride is choppy due to the extra drivetrain weight up front.

I can guarantee you that the Audi will be in the shop more than ANY of the other cars we are talking about here."
2639,"September 20, 2003 5:45PM",syswei,"As ljflx is saying, I also don't find the LS and E an appropriate comparison. When it comes to sedans (as opposed to sports cars), roominess is a key factor and differentiator between different classes of cars.

Here are the figures (in liters, I couldn't find a site with cu ft):

LS interior 3036 liters, cargo 572 liters

S interior 2973, cargo 436

E interior 2752, cargo 450

I think its pretty clear that the E is in a different class, i.e., the E midsize and the others fullsize.

You may argue the same about MB but that just hasn't been my experience. Maybe I've just been lucky so far.

So if I want a luxury car with AWD (and I do) and don't like SUVs (and I don't) what options does that leave me with? Looks like the E or S class.

 I've had a 1992 Lexus LS400 from the beginning. I can attest to the bulletproof LONG term reliability of the car. I've probably spent $3,000 in scheduled maintenance. I've spent $3.00 in a blown tailight bulb. That's it. Well..It was until some idiot girl smashed into my Left Front after blowing through a Red Light yesterday.:(
I won't belabor the board with that story.

Merc,
  Last time I checked, my LS430 sure as heck didn't drive like a Buick. (I had an '89 Park Ave, Great car) I've consistently agreed with you when you criticize the styling of these cars. You're right in saying Lexus has taken a step back from the innovative designs that allowed them to establish a foothold in the industry.

I think others have pointed out well that the LS is a better value for money. Considering the S430 is more expensive, it ought to at least beat the LS in the numbers game performance. You're correct, however, in saying that these numbers are only a part of the story.

I think we all can agree Lexus fundamentally changed the Luxury car industry with it's entry in 1990. Attempting to classify any car as ""better in design, prestige"" is a subjective judgement at best. Lexus has proven it can play with and even beat with the ""Big Boys"" in virtually every arena, ""Reliability, value, 0-60, Customer Service..."" My personal opinion mirrors most on this board. Lexus needs to improve their exterior designs.

BTW: heard about MB's new 7 speed Transmission...Question: Is there really a need for all of this?

Boo20 - I understand your point and agree with you completely. But I have an LX470 which treats 2 ft. of snow like a car treats a 2 inch hill pile of dirt. Nonetheless I, like Syswei, wish Lexus would make AWD available in the LS. But my old boss, who had the A8L I drove occasionally in the past (and it was a nightmare and in the shop so often I lost count of it) had to put snows on in winter otherwise the car was not that effective in the snow even with AWD. That is according to him as I never drove it in the snow. But from a financial standpoint (and since I prefer an LS430 over an S-500) I could lease an LS430 and a RX330 for a tad more than an S-500 AWD and I'd go that route first. But that is me. Now with all that said I will tell you that I love the S-500 and would be driving it (probably with AWD) if Lexus wasn't around. I think MB's reliability is far removed from Audi but it seems very difficult for anyone to replicate the exceptional reliability the Japanese have brought to the table. But if anyone can it will be MB and possibly BMW in the longrun. But only if both fix the issues at hand without rushing onto the next level. I'm convinced that is why MB reliability has slipped so much. I don't for a second think its the engineering or drivetrains."

Of course a Lexus drives better is easily 5 times the car, when it comes to build and engineering etc etc, but what they do share is the same philosophy. Neither of them are really that satisfying to drive. They're both dull in styling and design and do nothing for the lust factor, and they both cater to being quiet and lush above all else. There is never any mention of actual driving. Incidently, the press has also said this same thing, especially about the SC430 and the ES300. Buick also just identified Lexus as their target, so obviously they see some similarities. Again, I'm not saying that Lexuses are buicks, I'm saying that aren't worlds apart either. They're more similar than not.

I am curious if those who found the new A8's ride to be choppy, were driving cars with the 19 inch wheels..and, what was the adjustable suspension setting on, since the A8 has multiple suspension modes.

By contrast, I enjoyed a relatively smooth ride in the A8 that I took out for a long demo ride, but it had the 18 inch wheels. I noted that the test report which mentioned the ""busy ride"" of the A8 all used a car with the 19 inch wheels.

I35..??:

I am a long time Infiniti fan, having owned a few Q45's...but the I35 is out of place in this thread. I am very familiar with this model since I have had them as loaner cars on several occasions when my Q45 was in for service. It is a very nice, comfortable car, which offers lots of bang for the buck, but it is not in the same class with its big brother, the Q45, or any of the other cars in this luxury class. It is also a ""lame duck"" in its current configuration, as the car is get replaced in the next six months in it's new incarnation.

6 Speed:

This is not another copying issue....I think that 6 speed transmissions are the evolution of the transmissions for most cars in this class. The new Jaguar XJ's have 6 speeds. I find the main virtue of the 6 speed to be an improvement in fuel economy due to a more efficient drivetrain. The upcoming seven speed Mercedes trans is a further incremental step in transmission evolution.

6 cylinders vs 8 cylinders:

I think that a very nice car can perform quite well with six cylinders, but for high output performance, and ultimate smoothness, the V-8 seems to be the choice. I doubt that this will change. Of course, Acura has stuck with a very smooth 6 cylinder in their flagship RL, but that car is a notch below these cars.

I think that some of the Jag owners who say the old six is smoother than the V8 may be trying to talk themselves into this, or they are comparing it to an older incarantion of the Jaguar V-8 engine...By the way, it should be noted the new XJ is being offered in a 6 cylinder form in England to offer the big Jag in a more affordable and economical configuration..."

PS Your comments about not needing to have owned a car to post your opinions are absolutely correct and I don't think anyone on this board has ever stated otherwise:

I would certainly agree that the Looks of a car does not require prior ownership to have a very valid opinion on, it is a totally subjective judgement that we all can make.

I also think you would agree that having driven a car would lend someone more credability on issues like fun to drive and handling, comfort and quiet then a person who has never driven the car would have.

Finally I am sure you would agree that Someone who has owned a varity of cars like Mercedes and LS and BMW would probably be in the best position to compare the vehicles one to the other and would therefore demand the most credability.

Speaking for myself I own an LS 430, I have only driven a Mercedes S class and have never driven a BMW. My knowledge beyond that is gathered from friends and car magazines.

It has nothing to do with what I drive. You wanted to make a big case of .4 of a second when comparing a 130k car to a 75k car...You used to terms like ""smokes"" ..and other over the top descriptions.

Meanwhile, I quoted two major sources in the automotive press which seem to put these cars in a similar class.

However you did not use the term ""smokes"" when comparing the .4 of a second difference between a Mercedes S430 and a Lexus LS430....That is actually an even larger differential, as a ratio of the speed. Hmmm?

Being the one who actually buys with these vehicles and lives with them, as opposed to being a rooting section for Mercedes, is a big difference. To be quite candid, some of your opinions are very strong for a fan, rather than a driver.

Styling is very subjective. Strongly comparing a Lexus to a Buick is harsh. By comparison, I think that some folks might see a resemblance between the discontinued Buick Skyhawk and a Mitsubishi Eclipse too, but that is subjective. I might say it once, but I would then back off, and try to respect your opinion as an Eclipse driver."

You're right I didn't use the word ""smoked"" to describe the difference between the LS430 and the S430, because you need at least a half second to make difference, if you were racing the two cars. However, the difference between those two other cars is more than 4 tenths of a second, it would be like a full second, and thats just from 0-60, if again the tested R&T figure for the XJR (5.1) or Car and Drivers figure of 5.3 secs is compared to that other similarly powered S-Class. That would be only the beginning of the performance gap between the two cars, if you really looked at figures here. I didn't any time state that one car was in different class from the other based on it's performance. I merely said that there wasn't much contest between the two cars performance wise. The data you listed was from 2001 and was irrelevant.

I like looking at, reading about and occasionally test driving the higher-end marques. But, when it comes to spending my own money [or my family's or friend's :-) ], I'm big on value, getting the most bang for the buck. For me, the I35 fits. I hadn't given the ""I"" a second glance in years, but last fall I happened to look at the I35 and was impressed with the refinements and improvements Infiniti had made to the car. It fit the bill for my mom and she ended up getting one. I've been home several times recently and I've been surprised how much I've enjoyed driving it. It kinda grows on you. Anyway, my real point is, to me ""High-end Marques"" covers a fairly broad range. (btw - I think Infiniti is doing a pretty good job of closing the ""status gap"" between itself and Lexus. Of course, my view is affected by my perception of value.)

I haven't read way back in the posts here, but I get the impression from what you said that the discussion is of the more lofty luxury representations. There are several cars priced as high as $45-large I'd love to have the opportunity to own. Cheap (Frugal sounds better doesn't it?) as I am though, I'd have a hard time moving into the $50K and above arena. Going over $35K is a stretch for me to consider. I think the '04 Lexus LS430 is a gorgeous car, but even if money was not a consideration for me, I'm not sure I could justify to myself spending that much. But, of course, that's just me. Then again, I saw a Maserati on the Speed Channel the other day.....I'm just a contradiction in terms, aren't I? Oh, well.

SV - I read an article several years ago in Popular Mechanics that said the engineering characteristics of the in-line six make it the most inherently balanced engine design. They were assessing BMW's V12 in the 7 series. They compared the sound of the engine on acceleration to ripping silk. Said the engine was like multiplying the benefits of the in-line six by two, making it twice as good. I've wanted a straight six ever since. I hope BMW never goes the way of Mercedes; succumbing to market forces and going to V6's. Even having said that, I must admit I love the Audi A4 Quattro with it's V6. I really like the V6 in my mom's I35. :-)

b4z - I'm curious. When you drove Infiniti ""I""'s as loaners, were they I30's or did you also have the opportunity to drive an I35? I've driven several I30's as loaners [1st gen (barely not a Maxima) and 2d gen) and I was never impressed. That's why I hadn't given the I30 a second glance and was quite surprised by the improvements in the I35."

The I35 and I30 are birds of a feather, but the I35 got an evolutionary tweak with a bit more engine power/torque, and slighly better handling, due to the bigger tires and wheels."
2674,"September 23, 2003 4:56PM",tturedraider,"I don't mean to be rude, but you're not saying anything I'm not already aware of.

A 12%, 28hp increase and a 13%, 29lb-ft increase in torque. The I30 was very floaty. The I35 is very well controlled.

btw - Just for complete accuracy, Infiniti has announced that the I35 is continuing as a 2004 model. There is no reliable information out there right now as to the exact timing of its replacement. It may indeed have a short model year run or it may run for the complete model year. You are correct, it is pretty well accepted that 2004 is the last year for the current iteration. But, the prevailing opinion of those who speculated about the '03 I35 was that it would not continue as a 2004. Nissan has a model sold in Japan called the Teana that is ""based"" on the Maxima with more ""luxury"" styling. The Teana is offered with AWD in Japan and the the current prevailing speculation is that it will be brought over as the I35's replacement. This fits with Infiniti's stated plan to concentrate on RWD and AWD vehicles.

2675,"September 24, 2003 12:28AM",pablo_l,"As an ex-owner of a 2001 XJR and a 1996 XJS previously, I can attest to the fact the i6-cyl was a smoother engine. Not that the V8 isn't civilized, but still an I6 engine has and will always have the better natural balance. It's well known in engine circles that I6 and V12 (two I6, basically) offer the best balance and smoothness. Physics facts about secondary vibrations and such.

The gruntier V8 note in the higher revs is actually a rason for the popularity of the V8, since it's macho since the days of big V8s in the USA.

In the end, the quest for total smoothness is self-defeating, though. Thnk of floating in a perfectly idolated, noiseless car... is that fun when you go for a spin?"
2676,"September 24, 2003 12:37AM",pablo_l,"Actually, the Jag I6 in the XJS was so silky smooth that I think it outsmoothes the V8 in my ""special occasion"" car, an early 90s RR Corniche.

But it's also a matter of the character of the particular engine (and exhaust system).

It's one of those things - within the BMW range, for instance, I also think it's well-establshed that the I6s are actually smoother than the slightly more raucuous V8s: when the latter revs up it develops attitude, whereas especially the smaller displacement 6s just spin up like a little turbine.

But at the same total displacement, it's easier to make make the 8 cyl spin higher, and probably -I suspect- make it more efficient all in all - smaller cyls can be fed more efficiently.

2679,"September 25, 2003 11:29AM",fenn,"I have mixed feelings about this review. I did not agree with some of the reviewer's findings, however, I lack objectivity, since I have an XJR.

However, let it suffice to say that some of the Edmunds reviewer's conclusions are different than those in recent reviews of the XJR in both ""Road and Track"" and ""Automobile Magazine""...

In particular, I cannot agree with the reviewer's thoughts about the handling, and cornering, since I find the car very tight, and the steering quite responsive. The XJR feels like a much more responsive and sporting car in the curves when compared to the S430, S500, and Audi A8, which are luxury cars are in the same price range as an XJR.

If you want to compare this car with an M5 or E55, the XJR may feel a bit softer, but this is a larger, luxury class vehicle. Therefore, the review's final comparison of the XJR with the smaller E55 seems inappropriate, since are obviously two very different types/sizes of vehicles.

I will agree with the reviewer that the base XJ8 offers many of the XJR's attributes at a much lower price...In fact, I have mentioned that in my comments earlier in this thread. However, for me, the supercharger and the performance tweaks of the XJR do make a difference....Only the buyer can decide whether this is worth 12k to 15k of their money.

One major error did stick out. The reviewer's complaint about the brake and accelerator height differential is way off base---since the XJR's brake pedal height is quite adjustable. Other reviewers commented favorably on this adjustability and adaptability. Hmmm? I guess the Edmund's reviewer could not figure this out.....So much for being a thorough journalist."
2680,"September 25, 2003 1:18PM",pablo_l,"I have always been amused by most reviewers inability to relate to the British concept of a ""gentlemen's GT"". It is not supposed to be a sharp sports-car, for which it would have to give up some of the coziness that -as the whole itnerior treatment shows- are of the utmost importance to the car's philosophy. The fact the car comes with abundant performance is nearly a case of British humor: you sit as cozy and comfortably as if you were reading The Times sitting by the fire-place in your library, bloodhound at your foot, a cognac-dipped cigar in the corner of your mouth... and yet you can still set things ablaze. Look up ""Bristol Blennheim"" to try to understand the basic philosophy, but the new XJR does without the quirks and impracticalities. I find it brilliant.

Reviewers seldom reward ""personality"" in cars - they tend to always go for the ultra-clinical and sharply performing, even when it's somewhat sterile. I admire German cars -heck, I am half-German- and have had a view, but think they're a tad too damn functional and lacking in humor. To me, when you get into the $50k+ car realm you are giving up rationality anyhow. I'd demand custom-to-fit, and since no one will design a car to my spec, it typically leads to a car with some traits that appeal to me, but deter others.

I think it's stupid to make car recommendations for other people based on the premise that one knows which one the ""better car"" is, a presumption that unfortunately is common to car journalists. Instead of trying to understand the differentiating attributes and putting themselves in the shoes of the true target audience, they measure the car by never-changing standards that might work on $25k cars, but are somewhat laughable in luxury territory.

It's idiotic to claim people should buy the E55 instead of the XJR because they'll lap the Nuernburgring 3 seconds faster. A $7,000 motorcycle will trounce them all into oblivion, so geez, save yourself $65k and buy that. All these performance sedan represent compromises, it just so happens these compromises make them the best choice for their very particular target audience."
2681,"September 25, 2003 2:00PM",fenn,"pablo:

I agree. For me, each car has its very own character, yet many reviewers love to compare apples with oranges, in a less than realistic manner.

The greatest feature of the XJR is that I can cruise around most of the time in gentlemenly comfort. It is big, refined, luxury car...Yet, I can agressively unleash the supercharger and use the car's high performance side at the drop of my foot.

A Jaguar driver is not typically going to be comparing the XJR with an M5 or E55. The Jaguar driver is likely a person that likes the Jaguar characterics and cache, and opts for the performance variant with the XJR."

Fact is, it's probably harder to find a bad car that is over $30k than it is to find a truly bad wine that costs over $10 these days - and that is bad enough: there'll be wines you don't like, but it's hard to find truly bad ones.

A wine enthusiast would not tell another ""I think you should get the $20 Merlot because it's a better wine"" when he knows the other guy is a Sauvignon Blanc fan and is considering to buy a case of Marlborough stuff...

2685,"September 28, 2003 5:24PM",pablo_l,"Saw a RR while out on the motorcycle, and honestly I thought it underwhelming. Truly a sign of the times: European car design for the most is in unimaginative trouble, it seems largely disoriented on how to combine tradition with elegance and yet introduce innovation, and in my opinion this is opening a huge window of opportunity only (and inexplicably) the Nissan group is benefiting from.

I can't think of the last high-end car design I truly liked right now. By far, I think the best design of the last few years is the MINI, which is a devastating score card for high end car designers."
2686,"September 28, 2003 5:40PM",ljflx,I would tend to agree with you except that I did think the S-class was a fabulous design and I think Audi found a good balance with the A8. The new SL is nice looking though I don't find it as appealing as when it first came out. Long-term - I don't think it is going to be the classic car that the old model was. In NJ I saw one ad that listed about 30 of them for sale so the sales trend must be slowing. Nonetheless I still like it. There is nothing special about the rest of the MB line-up. BMW's new styling under Bangle is AWFUL and the new 6-series looks like a Pontiac Bonneville to me. The A8 is the only Audi design I like out of Audi's lineup. Jaguar styling has always been classic and remains so in my opinion. Maybe that is why they are so hesitant to make the revolutionary changes that MB and BMW are making.
2687,"September 28, 2003 9:28PM",merc1,"It does appear the European car community is at a styling crossroads of some sort, though I hardly think that a few misteps in styling signals a crisis. Especially considering how many good looking cars they make compared to a few that aren't. Unlike the Japanese brands, which is servely the opposite.

The BMW 7-Series started it, followed by CLK, Maybach, and now the 5-Series (more on it in a min). They all range from ugly (7-Series) to just not quite right (CLK). BMW may have missed it with the 7, but the 5 *might* prove to be a different story. Bill Jacobs BMW (Naperville) has a new 5-Series on the lot and it's not nearly as bad as the 7-Series, dare I say I kinda like it. It's kinda big in the hips and much more substantial looking that the old 5. The interior is so futuristic for a BMW and moves clearly away from the old ""cockpit"" theme of every BMW prior. I finally got a good detailed look at a Maybach 57 today also. MB of Naperville has a 57 model out front with MFR plates on it. One look and you can tell it's being driven by a MB/Maybach exec, the interior and exterior were very dirty and the tires looked as though someone had been playing E55 driver with the car. Anyway, I like the styling a little bit more now, it doesn't look at Lincolnish as I first thought, except for the grille. If anything it looks like the previous S-Class, but rounded off. I really didn't realize how big this car is, as it made the E55 next to it look like a C-Class. I still hate the rear end's red light strip.

ljflx,

I know you like or liked the SL, but what do you think of the CL. IMO, it's the best looking Mercedes going today. What changes do you think Mercedes is making that are revolutionary?
BMW is the only one I see taking some serious styling risks.

M"
2688,"September 29, 2003 5:50AM",ljflx,"I'll have to take a look at the CL when I have a chance. The last S-class body style which has now transcended to the E and C was a revolutionary change for MB in my opinion. It took the line to a sport luxury look from a classic luxury look. The latest design is best suited for the S - again - just my opinion. Actually when you look at BMW designs - particularly the 7 - they are going in the opposite direction.

I still like the SL - very much. But when it first came out I thought it was a knockout. It doesn't bowl me over like that anymore but it is still a wonder car."
2689,"September 29, 2003 5:26PM",pablo_l,"The CL happens to be my favorite current Merc design, too. It is elegant and to the point, without unneccessary distraction thrown in meely for effect. I think excessive ""character lines"" are a general malaise with many current European designs, it seems the designers got tired of the clean surface, but I am not sure the public ever did.

The purposeful, simple predatory feel of the traditional BMW design has given way to a ""shock"" design, and I have no idea why they want to play rebellious ""let's shock our parents"" teen strategies. It's a sign of insecurity, I guess, for according to CAR the 7 series re-design is complete and due for next year, an obvious admission of a blunder. BMWs always looked planted, now they look more bloated and top-heavy, and, dare I say it, Japanese.

Audi and Jag merely stick to what works for their identity, and are successful with that perception wise. And I think that's what many high-end customers actually want: they want to buy into some notion of heritage and tradition, and that's better underlined design wise unless you want customers to re-consider things with every product generation..."
2690,"September 29, 2003 9:16PM",merc1,"Well get ready because Audi is going radical too. The new 05' A6 (March 04' debut) is supposed to have the double grille design of Audis last three show cars, Nouvolari, Pikes Peak etc.

I don't remember either of those colors being available in 2001. The tectite gray on Edmunds looks too light but I remember that color very well from 2001 as it or the brilliant silver were the colors I would have gone with had I went the MB route. The tectite gray was darker in actual appearance than it comes across as on edmunds and it's possible it was that color. But the color I saw had a very rich lustrous look, one I can't ever remember seeing which leads me to think it was the designo graphite. A knockout color for sure - but unfortunately I didn't get a chance to see the interior of the car which likely would have confirmed it.

DonFenn,

I would call it being a true fan, certainly not an obsession as I could have gotten any old (read cheap) Mercedes just to say I have one. When I do step up I'm going to do it oh-so right. Mercedes remains my favorite brand, if not always my favorite car in each segment. Entry level, I like the Audi A4 better than the C-Class for example, but when it comes to the S, SL, CL and E there is precious little else that I like more, as far as luxury cars go. Audi is just a redesign (A6) from replacing BMW as my second favorite, as BMW seems determined to erase all of their design language from the past 15 years (that I can remember).

Unfortunately they didn't have the non-sport model so I put the suspension in the most 'comfortable' mode. My first impression is that this is an absolutely solid car. Nothing that Lexus makes comes even close. I also felt that the ride of the S class was much better. How much of that is simply based upon design and how much were the large wheels and sport suspension of the E class I don't know. I have heard it said that the air suspension on the E is almost as good as the S so I'll just have to try another one and see.

Obviously people have different opinions. No one car is for everybody. But I'm curious if you saw this letter in the most recent AutoWeek:

""I have owned three E-Class Mercedes: a 1990, a 1994 and a 1998 4Matic. The quality between the 1990 and the 1998 is quite different. Gone is the rock-solid feel and the parts quality...Mercedes has changed the quality of its cars, and I will likely not buy another one."""
2712,"October 3, 2003 7:52AM",sv7887,"""My first impression is that this is an absolutely solid car. Nothing that Lexus makes comes even close""

I just love these unsubstantiated statements..Everyone knows that Lexus builds cars with bulletproof reliability. Even the diehard Benz loyalists on this board acknowledge the Lexus edge in the realm of quality. I don't think I need to start the usual rant about how the surveys show this..

 As for comparing the E500 to a LS430, you might want to mind the $15-20K price difference. The LS doesn't compete with the E but rather the S-Class.

Something I wanted to bring up...The Lexus dealer and the body shop have had a jolly good time repairing the damage that fool wreaked on my 92 LS. They've literally had to replace everything attached to the Left Front Wheel. (The car took a 30MPH impact on the Left Front) The body parts are more expensive than those on my LS430! (Scarcity I assume?) I demanded that no aftermarket parts be put on the car. The Lexus dealer didn't even think aftermarket body parts existed for the LS400. (I'm somewhat skeptical.)

The body shop warned me that they might have trouble matching the paint on a 11+ yr old car, and have requested an additional week to get it right. (It's already been 11 days) Does anyone have any experience with this?

Sorry - I'm not a person that has to knock one car or one brand to praise a decision I made to buy another. If you want to knock a car because your a fan that's a different story. But this isn't a sports type of board. The LS430 is probably the most bullet proof car made based on everything I've read - reliability studies, awards and accolades year after year plus my own personal experience for 8+ years now. There are a host of other cars that are probably as or nearly as reliablle but they are all made by the Japanese. But regardless of reliability the body build on an LS430 is incredibly high quality. I've driven the E-430 4natic many many times, admittedly the old model - and it isn't close to an LS430, nor is it close to an S-class. Among other things it rattled annoyingly. The e is a completely different car. It doesn't have LS430 or S-class refinement, smoothness or quietness. Now the S-class and LS430 are quite close and here it is a matter of preferences. Neither car blows the other way."
2714,"October 3, 2003 12:05PM",boo20,"My comments were about the 2003 E class. When I bought my first Benz in '94 (C class) I had test driven the LS and liked the ride of the C class better. Thought it felt more solid although it had a very conservative design before they redesigned it. This is not ""bashing"" Lexus in order to ""elevate"" MB. It is a statement that I drove both cars and was sold on the MB. Since then I have purchased a '99 SL and '00 E 320 4 matic. I completely agree with the observation that these cars do not feel as solid as (even)the '94 C class. However the 2003 E class I test drove the other day seemed to exude the solidity that MBs of old had a reputation for. Note that saying that MB has a more solid feel than a Lexus is not the same as saying that they are more reliable. On repeated occasions I have ackolwedged that Lexus is more reliable. I do think, however, that this difference in reliablity is over-rated and is complettely trumped by MBs better aesthetics, ride, safety and innovation. The E class is the appropriate comparison to the LS430. I believe that the E is a btter car overall. The S clas is in a different class (no pun intended) altogether and is so superior to anything Lexus makes that it's not a fair comparison (also different price point)."
2715,"October 3, 2003 12:20PM",nvbanker,"Yes, but, your power windows in the LS430 will probably not fail and drop into the door, and your A/C will probably work without a problem. In the S class, that's not a sure thing, trust me.

Superior to an LS430 - not in my book. They are pretty much equals. The E vs LS - Everyone I know who plays in this league shops the LS vs the S for a very simple reason - size of car. I looked at the E a few years ago and dismissed it immediately because of its size. I honestly never realized how small it was. I wouldn't buy it anymore than I'd buy an ES300 because I could'nt fit my family into it comfortably.

NYbanker - agree - but I've never driven more than 110mph in my life - and when i did that speed it was in a 1995 LS400 which handled it with ease."
2717,"October 3, 2003 2:05PM",syswei,"Well, since the S430 costs 31% more than the LS430, is 9% slower 0-60, has 5% less HP and 8% less torque, it had better be ""superior"" in SOME ways to SOME people, else MB would sell zero units.

Hands down, MB wins in sheer prestige. Aesthetics are a personal judgement, and in my personal opinion the S does offer more attractive exterior styling (but not necessarily interior).

As far as ""ride"" and handling, I will agree that the LS is more oriented toward luxury. But Lexus isn't the slouch you seem to think. Here's a quote from the only available review of the 2004 LS: ""...lead some to believe that the LS 430 doesn't handle well when compared with such European benchmarks as the BMW 7 Series or Mercedes-Benz S-Class, but we haven't found that to be the case. The LS 430 can, in fact, be driven hard, whereupon it reveals lots of grip and very good handling."" (The full review is at http://www.nctd.com/review-intro.cfm?ReviewID=1432 and the writer, btw, ""won the California Rally Series championship in 1993 and was named Rookie of the Year. He went on to win the SCCA Southern Pacific Division Pro Rally championship in 1994"" so one might think he knows a bit about cars.)

Yes the S might be better in some things but not all, else why would the LS win plaudits like Automobile Magazine's ""best luxury car over $40k"" (Feb 2002): ""Quite simply, the LS 430 nails the luxury-sedan formula in all the key areas.""

For you to state that the S is ""so superior to anything Lexus makes that it's not a fair comparison"" is your OPINION based on what you find important. It is not an objective statement."

Hmmm. I would guess that the 2,000 E-Class owners who had to have their cars bought back by Mercedes because of problems would disagree. In fact, these problems have caused Mercedes to publically announce they are scaling back on some innovations."

To each his own as far as what constitutes a satisfying driving experience, and as I've said the LS does tilt more toward luxury.

But your use of the word ""comparable"" is interesting because there is no comparability when it comes to price: the base S500 goes for 46% more than the base LS430 (2003 MSRPs). If MB sold the S280 in the US, it would list for about the same $55k as the LS430 (based on UK prices of 50,757 euros for the S430, 38,187 for the S280, and US price of $73,320 for the S430).

An S280 would be priced like a LS430...Just how fun would the S280 be to drive???

2722,"October 3, 2003 3:58PM",b4z,"It is my opinion that the S class is probably superior to the LS 400 dynamically.
I think at 9/10s or 10/10s the S class will show it's heels to a Lexus.
98% of you will never drive that way.

I have a particular road that I drive in NC that
tells the tale of how well a car's suspension is sorted out.
A hard left sweeper at the bottom of a hill.
It pushes the supension down as hard as it ever will go.

In my Camaro the back tires rub the inner fenders.
In my Intrigue the inside wheel would squeal.
In the Impala I can get all four ties squealing.
I have driven 2 LS 400s on it and they understeer and feel a tad flabby.
The S class I drove was remarkably composed and level without any bump stop or jounce problems.

Which car would I buy?
The Lexus, because it will provide me with years of reliability.
Maybe the '04 Sport package will make it a contender."
2723,"October 3, 2003 4:01PM",ljflx,"It is really not fair to compare the S430 or S500 price to the $55.5k base of the LS. In truth an LS430 ultra will list at $71k and is equally equipped as an S430 that would go in the $76-77k range. What makes Lexus different is they don't shove everything down your throat and force you to buy every option the ultra has. You'll never see a $55k LS430 because Lexus, at a minimun, puts the premium package on it which gets you to $58k. From what I've been told you won't see too many cars with just the premium package this year. But you will see a good balance of cars that are priced at $61K (that modern lux package), $66k (custom lux) and $71k (ultra lux). So from a price/options choice perspective you get more choice from Lexus to hold prices down.

pathdoc - I found in 2001 that the LS430 with euro suspension easily outhandled a base S430 or S500. It still road incredibly smooth and quiet and don't ever expect Lexus to move away from there. The 2004 outfitted with that euro suspension is supposed to be the best handling car yet. Automobile mag said on one hand that the euro was better than air suspension and actually handled very well and rode better than either the air or standard suspension. On the other hand they also said the car does things so effortlessly that it reminds them of a first class hotel and makes you forget the road. That has always been the knock on the car so if you want that hard road feel you'll never get it at Lexus. That in turn means Lexus will never win one of those comparos the mags love to put on. that is money in the bank for the next 25 years or so. BMW is the place to go for that and they will win most of those comparos. Those things aren't about the cars they are about the drivers preferences. I'm a ritz carlton type hotel person when I'm not renting condos on vacation and that is exactly what I want then and the Lexus LS430 is the closest thing to the ritz on the road. The 2004, from, what I've read so far delivers what I'm looking for more than ever."
2724,"October 3, 2003 4:11PM",pathdoc,"I realize that the LS430 is much less expensive than a S500. I guess my point is that if you can afford either and want the best from the point of view of handling,ride and performance I have chosen the Mercedes. The article which I listed came to the same conclusion. I am sure that if soft ride was the number one criteria lexus would probably prevail. I still have an open mind and after driving a new XJR last week may take an entirely different route next year. The new Jag. may be more of a (price) competitive vehicle. The list price is not much more than a loaded LS430."
2725,"October 4, 2003 6:01AM",syswei,"In maybe 2-3 more years we'll see a hybrid LS, and that sort of powertrain should be like adding 2 more cylinders to the engine...and the engine at the time may be greater than 4.3 liters. And hybrid will give you awd, not to mention better fuel economy. So there is a very good chance that, depending on what MB comes up with, the LS will significantly out-accelerate the S500 of that timeframe...and still be priced way less. But as ljflx suggests, Lexus is still going to give you less road feel than MB."

2727,"October 4, 2003 11:59AM",pablo_l,"Several factors are at work there, and they affect *all* car brands.

First of all, the trend is towards *many* people owning luxury brands. It used to be 10 years ago that cars like the Ford Taurus outsold the BMW and Merc models of similar size by 5 to 1 or more, but by 2006 market research indicates the trend will have reversed.

People's car buying habits have changed. Most people only keep their car for 3-5 years, as opposed with the old pride in keeping a quality car going for as long as possible. Thus, 20 year longevity is something that car manufacturers could do, but it simply doesn't pay fr them to do it anymore, because the vast majority of buyers couldn't care less.

Between semi-luxury cars becoming the most popular car segment, and people keeping cars for only a lease period, the priorities in car design have changed. Of course brands like MB have to go with the times, and introduce elements of European fashionista flair to differentitiate - which also automatically means cars will age less gracefully than they used to.

Back in '90, when you saw a 10 year old MB you didn't think twice about it, and thought ""hm, nice car"". These days, if you see a '93 MB, you go ""harrumph, time to replace that, what"" - MB has actually been one of the last brands to become part of this movement, they held on to the concept of building to a standard, as opposed to a cost point, for the longest in those segments.

*Everybody* builds cars to a cost point there days. No one blatantly over-engineers. Those are the facts of the car industry in the new millenium, and to single out individual players in this respect is a fallacy."
2728,"October 4, 2003 12:56PM",merc1,"lenscap,

Those 2000 03' E-Classes that were bought back because the new DVD-based Nav system couldn't be retro-fitted, not because those 2000 E320s and E500s were lemons. I think they handled the problem in the best way possible.

ljflx,

Why do you insist on comparing the LS430's so-called ""Euro"" option to the base Mercedes S-Class when Mercedes has a ""Sport"" package of their own designed to improve handling/braking etc? That isn't a fair comparision. If you compare the Sport versions of each car you'll find that the S is the more capable road car, at least until 04's models are tested.

I still think you're promoting a double standard when it comes to magazines, because one minute their right on the money and they next minute they don't have a clue. BTW, there is no ""hard"" road feel in a BMW 7-Series or S-Class, they ride smoothly too, difference is you can still tell what the car is doing, unlike the LS430. You're making it sound like the 7-Series rides hard or something and it doesn't. And yes I have driven both the 745i and 760Li, the V12 extensively.

Switching gears here a little. I don't know if you've ever been to one of BMW's Susan G Komen charity events? Its the best way to experience their cars without paying for their other driving programs. I spent the entire afternoon a few weeks ago driving the Z4, 330i, 745i, 760Li and 540i. Man what fun it was! There weren't many people on this particular day (a Friday) so I got to spend some real quality time with the 7-Series, especially the 760Li. What a car, turbine smooth and deceptively fast. The writers are right about I-drive. Get this, even the BMW reps warned not to try and use it while driving. Well being who I am I did so anyway. I honestly couldn't do anything with it more than adjusting the radio and air conditioning, and I'm not afraid of ""tech"" like a lot of people are, but I feel the need to shake a few BMW engineers for this overcomplication. The best thing I found out, is to simply use the voice command. We've talked about the styling before and its still ugly to me. That trunk lid is just unacceptable. I got to race a guy in the 760Li when I first took the 745i out, the V12 needs lots of space to show it's superiority as we found out it doesn't really start pulling hard until you're really ""speeding"". Still this is a direct contrast to the previous 740i/750iL relationship because when I drove those two cars the 750iL didn't seem any faster than the 740i, just a lot heavier.

sv7887,

Why all the what if scenarios? Mercedes isn't going to sell at 6-cylinder S-Class here again, so whats the point? At least not until they new direct injection (read: more power) V6's come out, even if they do it then I'll be shocked. Boo20 spoke about solidity not reliability, two very different things. You really hold CR and JDP as the end-all bible reguarding everything concerning the automobile, even things they can't measure...amazing as no one said anything about reliability. BTW, where can I get a LS430 for just over 40K? Since we're using Automobile Magazine...did you see what they said about the 04' LS?

""Lexus continues to portray this car as a competitor to the S-Class and 7-Series, but the LS430 actually follows the same archly conservative formula that once made Cadillac and Lincoln the big dogs in this class. The LS430 is still the best car in the world to own. However the luxury here is simply that you never think about driving the LS430. This is the ultimate in consumer goods, not the ultimate in luxury goods.""

Wow, exactly what European car fans have been saying all along. The LS is the worlds greatest appliance, reliable, but boring and totally uninspiring, with nothing for a ""driver"" to appreciate. I guess they're wrong about this right?

M"
2729,"October 4, 2003 3:23PM",ljflx,"Why? It's simple - the cost of the euro is $0! So if you want the sportier handling you can have it for less than a penny. That is why I compare it.

As for magazines - I said for a long time now - the singular car stories are worth it and provide valuable info - at times. The comparos are worthless because mag drivers have their favorite brands and find it hard to choose against them (most favor BMW until Porsche or some higher performance brand comes in - thus I can safely predict the results of comparo tests for the next 25 years even though such cars are not yet made. Do you have any doubt of who will win if the 2025 LS is compared with the 2025 7 series - care to make a wager? I'll take the 7.) and mag drivers come in heavily biased toward handling and performance and not the balance of a car that a high majority of the buying public is looking for. They also don't care about price or reliability. Plus they think customer satisfaction is 90% determined by how a car handles a sharp turn or drives at 100mph+. If they were right the manufacturers would make nothing but performance cars. It's obvious from the handful of performance cars out there that they are wrong."
2730,"October 4, 2003 3:35PM",boo20,By the way if I wanted a decent looking car that was reliable I would choose Acura over Lexus any day of the week. Nearly as reliable and their cars look like their designers really care about the looks of the vehicle.

i am thinking about surprising her on her birthday (comming soon in mid-November); having the car out on the driveway. alas; she loves good deals, and won't be happy if i tell her how much i actually paid for it. so, i am wondering if any of you who have car-shopped for an S-Class, (OR BMW 745i) found a REALLY good price if i lease? I live in San Diego, California. this morning, i found an ad in the newspaper from Hoehn Motors: 2003 NEW Mercedes S430. $899/month, $4,671 due at lease signing. nicely equiped (does that mean it's stripped?). 5 to choose from.

2738,"October 4, 2003 11:28PM",boo20,"bz4: in my mind the presence of front wheel drive on the Acura is an argument FOR and not against it compared to the Lexus. As I want AWD in my winter car the Lexus is out (even if liked everything else about it--which I don't). The Acura is at least a reasonable second choice by virtue of its FWD, aesthetics and overall value for the money. If I couldn't afford an MB I would definately go with Acura rather than Lexus. When we are talking about cars costing over 60 K value isn't really in the equation at all. Nobody buys an LS430 or S class because of ""value"". They are just not ""worth"" it on an incremental cost basis. If you can comfortably afford these cars then cost should be considered essentially to be a 'burnt offering.'

i_drive: I'm in the market for an '04 S class. Unfortunately there are plenty of unsold '03s laying around in dealer inventories (here in the midwest) including AWD models. Dealers are anxious to move these out before the '04s come out at the end of October so I'm certain you can get a great deal on them in the next few weeks. I saw an S430 with MSRP of 78 K on which you could probably have picked up at least a 5 K discount. That's a pretty good deal on this incredible car. Go for it.

Unfortunately for me this probably means no deals off list price for the '04s. Maybe I'll go for one of the leftover 03s myself."

Well, this might be true for SOME buyers, but I hardly believe that its true for all buyers in that price range. If an extra 10-20-30k doesn't matter to someone who has already decided to purchase a 60k+ car, why does MB sell any S430s at all?...why don't all the S buyers get the S500 (or higher)? Why does BMW sell alot of 745s? Why don't all the BMW buyers get the 760?"
2741,"October 5, 2003 6:50AM",syswei,"You said that ljflx's comparing an LS430's ""euro"" option to the base Mercedes S ""isn't a fair comparision""...even though, as he pointed out, the ""euro"" is FREE to any LS buyer who cares for it.

Well, if you are into ""fair"" comparisons, can you see that fairness is why I brought up the S280? Someone was trying to compare performance of the S500 to the LS430, and my point is that its unfair to compare the LS performance to a car that costs 46% more. It isn't even that fair to compare the LS to the S430, since the S430 costs 31% more (though the LS nonetheless beats at 0-60 and in HP and torque). I was saying that if MB sold the S280 in the US, it might (based on UK price differentials between the S430 and S280) cost the same as the LS430. And THAT would be a ""fair comparison"" (to use your words)."
2742,"October 5, 2003 6:58AM",syswei,"You asked ""where can I get a LS430 for just over 40K"". I don't know either. Maybe you should read posts more carefully if you are going to reply to them, because I never suggested anything less than 55K for an LS."

There are probably some MB fans who are thinking, ""if they didn't pick the S, Automobile Magazine's criteria must be flawed"". Hardly. It just means that their criteria are DIFFERENT from yours, not necessarily ""right"" or ""wrong"".

I have always said that Lexus tilts toward luxury over sport. ljflx has said that in his opinion, the LS with euro suspension ""easily outhandles"" the base S. But we also know that Lexus doesn't do anything like the S55 or S600. So I think is fair to say the the LS (base) starts more on the luxury side of the spectrum and MB (S55) can be had more on the sport side, and that there might be some overlap in the middle (LS euro vs S base).

If an individual buyer's definition of the ideal car is tilted more toward luxury and less toward sport, he can get an LS non-euro and it can be ""best"" FOR HIM. If his definition of the ideal car is more sporty, he can get an MB sport edition or S55 or BMW or whatever, and it can be ""best"" FOR HIM. Trying to espouse that either the S or LS is objectively better for EVERYONE is just plain silly."

At the very least, your point here avoids the subjective considerations of looks and aestethics that are often touted here when doing LS_vs_S_vs_7 comparos. I certainly don't see anyone arguing against this position that syswei articulated (eloquently, imo) above here."
2745,"October 5, 2003 2:27PM",sv7887,"Merc,
  I don't remember talking about 6 Cylinder MB cars..What I did take issue with is comparing a LS430 to an E Class. I'll leave that argument alone for the moment.

  The hyperbole on the part of the MB enthusiasts on this board is amazing. ""Lexus is no comparison for the S class"" Really? If the LS was SOO inferior then no one would buy one! What you MB guys keep missing is that that None of these cars are made for heavy performance driving. The average buyer of a LS is a 57 yr old Executive making $125K + a year. (Source Lexus Website) We're hardly the Indy Car Racing Group. None of these cars whether it be a LS, or S class can beat the true Performance Lux cars out there, such as the M5 or XJR.

As of yet, all this bashing about the Lexus lacking a ""Solid"" ride is purely Subjective. I always have pointed to Objective stats to point out that Lexus is at parity in nearly all areas.
The only thing MB loyalists can complain about is the overly Smooth ride (Is that a bad thing?) and bland design. Basically, it's Snobbery. You guys are like the Old Gentlemen's Club thumbing your nose at the younger generation.

I paid $67K for my LS430, and $51k back in 1992, for my 92 LS400..If I really wanted a S class, like any LS owner, I could afford one. Like my fellow LS owners out there, we've gladly taken the $10k + we've saved and laughed to the bank!

We've gotten a car that more reliable than anything on the road. Oh! you Benz loyalists moan, ""The LS430 is SO unoriginal will get SMOKED by the S Class"" The LS has a potent V-8 and drivetrain that will keep at or near parity with it's competitors. As for Originality, look at the newest Lexus designs. I'd say they are pretty original. Keep in Mind Lexus is only a 13 yr old company. You'd ought to give them credit for completely shaking up the Lux car industry. Now that Toyota has given Lexus their own identity in Japan, we ought to see them carve ought their identity in the coming years. As for now, I think I'll take my $10K and superior ownership experience thank you very much.

With Lexus you get superb customer service and one hell of a car..These performance characteristics mean nothing on the Real road. What % of MB, BMW, or Lexus owner race their cars? I'd say the majority of them are primarily commuter cars, and are seldom raced. Who wants to debate that?

Cheers,
SV"
2746,"October 5, 2003 4:23PM",boo20,"There are many things you said that I disagree with but let me focus on just one point you made that is easily refuted. Consider your contention that ""You guys are like the Old Gentlemen's Club thumbing your nose at the younger generation.""

Very interesting. Let's look at the demographics of the average LS vs S class buyer (source is MS Carpoint): The average age of an LS430 buyer is 64. The average age of an S class buyer is 58. So it seems to me that it is the older Lexus owners who are thumbing their noses at the younger MB buyers. Now I wouldn't make a big deal out of this and claim that this means anything other than refuting your contention that buying an MB as opposed to buying a Lexus is a manifestation of an older demographic.

Also you said: ""I paid $67K for my LS430, and $51k back in 1992, for my 92 LS400..If I really wanted a S class, like any LS owner, I could afford one. Like my fellow LS owners out there, we've gladly taken the $10k + we've saved and laughed to the bank!""

I'm sure you could afford either one. However, once again, lets look at the demograhics here (again, MS Carpoint is the source): The average yearly income of an LS buyer is 186,000. The average yearly income of an S class buyer is 284,000. At 90 K an S class is 50% of a typical Lexus buyers yearly income. I'm sure that many people in this group have settled for the Lexus because they couldn't afford the more expensive MB. Another way to look at it is that, although if you can afford an S class you can afford an LS, the opposite is not necessarily true."
2747,"October 5, 2003 4:51PM",b4z,What is the average and median age of the LS and S class buyer?
2748,"October 5, 2003 5:12PM",boo20,"bz4: unless I missed it somewhere MS Carpoint does not tabulate both of these but simply states ""age"". So technically I'm not sure if this is mean (as I assumed) or median age.

I should also add that Lexus' styling and marketing stategy makes more sense now that we understand the demographics of the luxury car buyer: Lexus is trying to appeal to an older, less affluent, group. Nothing wrong with that. It's just different than the average MB buyer. This appeal to an older buyer is probably why Lexus styling is so consistently more ""conservative"" and less exciting and innovative, if you will, than that of MB.

To elaborate on my point about income and affordability consider the following: If Lexus raised the price of the LS430 to the level of the S class would they sell more or fewer cars than they do now? What do you think? My guess is FEWER because they have now priced their ""average"" buyer out of the market. This makes the success of cars (which some percieve to have ""lessor value"") such as the S class all the more amazing."
2749,"October 5, 2003 6:11PM",sv7887,"You've misinterpreted what I said. MB as a car company is the Old Gentlemen's Club. I wasn't referring to the age of the owners. Lexus as portrayed is the young upstart. I was in fact referring to the Snobbery of the MB community.

You're taking the highest price of an S500 at $90K. I don't know what % of S class sales are 90K S500's (Merc do you know?) but my point was, anyone paying 65K+ for a LS can afford an S class MB (Perhaps a S430 or lower End S500)

The LS debuted at $35K in 1990. I distinctly remember a MB VP complaining on PBS that Toyota was selling them for a $10K loss as they thought it cost $45K to build. By the time I bought mine it was $51K. (All taxes included) You'd think people might have been discouraged, as Lexus as a brand name was still very vulnerable at that point. But the rising prices didn't deter anyone.
Reason? The original LS was better than the competition in the early 1990's. People paid the price, b/c it still was a bargain relatively.

A purely speculative point on my part..

How many Lux car buyers pay cash for their cars? (Open question to the board) I can imagine many leasing, or simply financing these days. Old timers like me prefer to pay cash, but I don't think this is universally true anymore. The Lexus dealer always points out to me in negotiation that they make more money on Leases and financing, than straight out cash transactions like mine.

Essentially the post was hitting at this point. Criticisms of Feel and design are purely Subjective. 0-60 times, Indycar handling, feel of Suspension have very little relevance to Real World driving. I sincerely doubt the majority of Lux owners race their cars where these specs might make a difference. I rarely can even hit 90+ on Massachusetts roads. These statistics are essentially Marketing fodder for the Auto equivalent of Pilot's Bull Sessions.

The points of Unparalled reliablity and superior customer service ARE applicable to the Real World. I don't have time to waste waiting for a service to be completed or having to deal with irritating defects/glitches.

A real world example:
Ever since my 92 LS was damaged in the accident, my Lexus dealer has provided me with a Loaner and is taking care of everything..(Insurance providing OEM parts, Body Shop hassles, and ensuring everything is done to my satisifaction). They are even going to drop off the car at my convenience fully detailed. A major headache has been reduced to a minor annoyance. That's called service.

I'm surprised that the MB loyalists fail to see the draw of Lexus. Lexus appeals to the affluent driver seeking a No Hassle experience. For the money I've spent on 3 LS cars in 11 yrs I've got a completely hassle free experience. The US workforce boasts the highest productivity rate in the whole world, so it's no wonder many affluent buyers opt for Lexus.

I invite my Fellow LS owners to chime in on this. Do you agree with my perspective? Also, Why did you buy your LS?

Cheers,
SV"
2750,"October 5, 2003 6:29PM",habitat1,"For what it's worth (not much), here's my take on the S-class vs. LS debate.

The Lexus is clearly the leader in reliability and dependability. How much that is important to you in a luxury sedan is a personal decision, but I know of many MB loyalists who are less and less enthusiased with what they perceive is the decline in the marquee over the past few years.

Unless you step up to the S55, the performance difference and driving dynamics are only slightly in favor of the S class, IMO. I agree with sv7887, neither are designed with the enthusiast in mind.

The LS430 probably isn't going to steal sales from the S-class among those who find the S the standard of projecting personal success. Take that for better or worse.

I briefly considered the S55 18 months ago, but ended up with an M5. I don't need the extra room of the S class and prefer a crisper handling car. But I never thought I'd end up with a substantially more reliable car to boot. Total number of unscheduled maintenance trips in 18 months: 1 for a check engine light that came on by mistake the 1st week I owned the car. None in 32k miles since.

So, is the S class worth the premium over the LS430? Perhaps to some. But to others, the LS430 is a heck of a good car that is unlikely to frustrate you with more trips to the dealer than you really want to make."

You're not comparing cars of equal specification. Thats like me saying the E500 Sport outhandles the regular LS430, that simply isn't a fair comparision.

I really think you're making to broad of a statement when it comes to the press. They do care about price. Haven't you noticed where a Mercedes gets knocked for costing too much more than it's competion. If not check out the comparo in Road and Track (I think two months ago) in which the SL500 came in forth, behind a Cadillac, Jaguar and a Porsche...due to price. Clearly the car would have ranked much higher if weren't for it's 98K price, the number tally confirms this, as the only place the SL really got dinged was in the value equation. They even stated that the SL500 was probably the best all-arounder and best car for everyday, in the test. You seem to equate a comparison test with only being a track meet, and that simply isn't so. How can they talk about reliability when they only have the cars for a few days, or a week? In order for them to include that into their deliberations they'd have to keep all 5 cars for a months and months. Not feasible. Their tests are to gauge a cars abilities, and yes they do drive the cars out in the real world. It just appears by the posts in this thread that when they slam an Audi A8 they're so right, but when a Lexus gets knocked for not being anything special to drive they don't know what they're talking about, or at least they aren't being through enough. Thats a double standard. The best example of this is the SC430 vs the segment.

Yes I'll wager about the 7-Series, because I'll be shocked if such a overcomplicated car wins any of the inevitable comparisions between the new LS, S, A8, and XJ. We should start seeing these next month, I'd say. Seriously, I'd be shocked if it does win, the car is a ergonomic mess. If they put it over simply because it handles better your point will be made, at least with that publication.

Also, check out some of the British mags take on the 7-Series. (I don't know if anyone here reads magazines like CAR, Topcar or EVO, but I think anyone that doesn't is missing the best automotive writing to be read today.) Anyway, I don't think I've seen the 7-Series win yet in one of their tests, its either the S-Class, XJ or A8 that come out on top, most of the time. Now I already see the A8 loosing over here, at least in a C&D comparo since they've pretty much said that they don't care much for the car because of it's ride. MT has a comparo of the XJ8 and the A8L in their Nov issue, btw.

I disagree with you on the demographic between the S and LS. They are not the same. Their has to be a difference between the average LS (55-60K) sold and the average S-Class (73-85K) sold. There is no way this is the same exact group of people. A lot of people that like the LS430 are stepping up from GS and RX models and the S-Class is hardly ever mentioned due to it's starting price. I realize you can ""take"" a loaded S500 later this morning if you choose, but from what I've seen that isn't the case with *most* LS430 buyers.

No I didn't get to attend the AMG event, it was sold out. There is always next year huh?

syswei,

You're talking about a car that isn't sold here for one, the S280. Next up, who is doing all the comparing between the LS430 and the S500, Lexus is. Lexus is the one billing the LS430 as the S-Class competitor so the imaginary comparison with a S280 is really pointless.

It's not Mercedes' fault that Lexus tries to cover two different segments with the LS430, which by the way is a wise strategy in most respects. None of the full size luxury cars are the same in price as the LS430, not the A8, 7 or S. Only the base XJ8 is in the same ballpark.

My point about the Automobile Magazine award is that the price cutoff it way too low because you can't get a S-Class, 7-Series or LS430 for anywhere near 40K.

""There are probably some MB fans who are thinking, ""if they didn't pick the S, Automobile
 Magazine's criteria must be flawed""

Not hardly, I'd suggest you read back to their 2000 issue in which they picked the S-Class for that very same award. Didn't say their criteria is wrong, just that the price cutoff is misleading.

sv7887,

Now I've said a lot of things, but I don't recall ever saying that the LS is no competition for the S-Class, that must be an actual owner saying that. Lets just say that if you think the LS' design is ""original"" I'll just cut this short by saying that I completely disagree with that. I don't see anyone complaining about the LS430 having an ""overly smooth"" ride. What I do see people complaining about is the control of the body and the handles that results from that compared to a German car. Who is going to complain about a smooth ride if the handling is up to snuff, that doesn't make sense. You're saying that suspension feel doesn't matter? You're kidding right? That is what makes a car ""drive"" the way it does. German cars have this in spades, hence their following. Nobody is saying that any of these cars have ""Indycar"" handling. You're blowing it out of proportion. If feel didn't matter then Lexus owners wouldn't harp about how smoothly their cars ride. In all these cars, from Audi to Mercedes to Cadillac and Infinfi, ""feel"" is what people look for in their first test drive. The ideal ride/handling mix is what will be debated forever, I personally just like Mercedes' take on the question. Just like Jaguar, Audi, BMW and Cadillac have their own definition of this.

Styling and design are personal things and it's easy for a Lexus owner to dismiss these as a grip because that is what the car is least good at. Just like MB fans don't see surveys as being the bible.

I'm not sure what the ratio is between the S430 and the S500, since 2002. Now before that, especially upon it's debut in spring of 1999, they sold almost equally. I do know that the previous S500 outsold the S420 by a pretty good margin from 1992-1999.

I disagree !

One (looks and styling) is subjective (personal opinion); the other (surveys) is objective (many opinions)

Think about how developed countries conduct business, politics, policies, etc. Many decisions are based on formal and informal surveys. For example, there is incontrovertible evidence that smoking leads to lung cancer ! How do we know ? Bcos a vast amount of data and records (statistical surveys) exist that show a correlation of long years of smoking to emphysema (?) and other lung diseases. That you and other Merc fans choose not to accept surveys that cast your brand in a weak position is only ignoring the obvious. OTOH, DCX is quite concerned about its current lack-lustre reliability issues with 300+ repairs per 100 cars over 3 years (2000-date). That ain't something to be proud of especially if you are behind the likes of Ford in this area. Yikes!"
2757,"October 6, 2003 9:11AM",sv7887,"Merc,
  I wasn't accusing you of saying a LS was no match for the S class. That accusation was meant for someone else. I haven't said anywhere that the LS design is original. However, I did say the newest Lexus designs seem to be. I'm using examples of the RX330, ES, and GX. The pictures of the new GS seem to corroborate my point.

Question is, do LS owners complain about this? Using your argument, it can be said that the LS followers in fact DO like their smooth rides. I think it's the German followers who have a problem with it, not the LS owners.

I'm not a suspension expert, but I'm going to guess that you probably sacrifice the smoothness of a ride when you go for sharper handling. (Correct me if I'm wrong) You make it sound like the LS handles like the 747 while the German cars handle like a F-22. Having driven both cars, the difference is perceptive, but not especially drastic. I really think this whole Handling issue is greatly blown out of proportion. I've said this repeatedly, those seeking a superb performance car would probably opt for a M5 or XJR. Also, unless you plan on racing these cars, it's just a pointless argument.

As for Demographics..The avg price of a LS isn't 55-60K. Even the typical base model is $58K. The common midrange one will cost around $65-67K. (I'm sure these prices have changed somewhat since I bought mine in '02). At $67K it's not that big of a step to an S430. Those paying $73K probably can step up to the base S500. That's all that I was trying to accomplish.

I preach about JDP and CU assessment b/c they consider the practical aspects of owing the car. I've always found that the testing criteria of Car and Driver and others to be unrealistic. Like I'm really going to take corners at 100+ MPH..

 They rate the Lexus # 1 with the Mercedes a close 2nd. BMW is last. What is more interesting is their comments on the highs and lows of each.
The Lexus gets high marks for ""ride,quietness,powertrain refinement,fit and finish,reliability,turning circle and ergonomics"" and lows in ""agility"" with a comment that ""body lean in corners is pronounced,steering lacks feedback and while the car was secure in our emergency-handling tests it didn't shine."" I would say that these are the negatives I have found when test driving the car in the past. If the Euro tuned suspension makes as large a difference as posters on this board have indicated I will try one with an open mind.
 The Mercedes highs were ""ride,handling,quietness,rear seat"" and lows were ""reliability and cup holders"". CR would not recommend the Mercedes because the predicted reliabilty was poor (solid black circle).

Someone asked about finance vs cash - I think here in Silicon Valley I am the last of the dying breed of people who buy cars cash.

Seeing these 80 year old guys puffing on cigars driving their Lexus--how many more years have they got? Will they still be driving in a few years to purchase another one? Cadillac was worried enough about the demographics of their buyers to do something about it. Will Lexus follow suit before it's too late?

With few exceptions, and contrary to what the Lexus enthusiasts seem to think is fair and proper, MB cars are sold out. You can't get an SL, CL class without an 18 month wait or sold used above MSRP. Look at the E class board where the '04s are sold out through March of next year before they have even hit dealer showrooms. The S class will not sell as briskly but still does well considering that it is in its last year of this production cycle with a new model coming out in '05.

Now with these surveys. There is a reason why European car owners/fans don't see them as the bible. Right here on Edmunds I can read about Acura TLs having one transmission problem after another. Also on here I can find more than a few people complaining about the ES300's transmission. What I really want somone to answer is how BMW managed to place 5th(?) in one these surveys, when the 7-Series by all accounts was the most bug ridden car of the year. None of this is reflected in these precious surveys. Why is that? But yet I can read on how Mercedes' have brake dust problems, how Minis have a bad ride and how a Hummer has bad gas mileage. My point is that these surveys are not conclusive to a point to assume that Mercedes' are breaking down at the side of the road. There is a lot of detail missing, especially with JDP data. There is no way I'm going to blindly accept these as gospel ever, because they simply don't tell the whole story. Yes, a Lexus is more reliable than a BMW or Mercedes, but how much so is the questionable part.

You're still missing the point about the handling of these two cars. Nobody is trying to make it seem like what you're saying when comparing a 747 to a F-22. Where has anyone said that the difference is that drastic? I don't know how else to explain to you. If you can find me one road test comparison of luxury sedans in a U.S. magazine that actually said one car was better than another simply because it could take a curve at a 100 mph better than the next car, I'll eat that issue. That simply is an exagerration of whats been said here.

Demographics. Ok so the average LS430 leaves out the door for 58K or even 68K, thats still about a 15K difference between it and a S500, there is no way everyone going for the Lexus can afford the S500. My point is here is that there is a different demographic for the S and LS, they aren't nearly the same, the only place where they would be is in the case of the S430.

pathdoc,

They actually knocked the S430 for it's predicted reliability, of which they don't know squat about yet due to the car being facelifted for 03', and for it's cupholders. How ridiculous.

2763,"October 6, 2003 9:35PM",ljflx,"There were about 35 SL's here in NJ listed for sale at ray catena each of the past two sundays. I don't know of any business that advertises anything that has already been sold. These waits are always badly overstated and disappear long beforehand.

I saw that demo on Lexus in microsoft car point and found out that it is from a census they take. I've bought Lexus vehicles since 95 and now that I think about it I've never been asked nor have i ever provided them my age. They did ask for a bracket of what age group I'm in though - if that counts.

I looked at some of the reviews at carpoint and the inconsistency is something. They say the 7 loses value quickly and the S and LS don't but then they rate the 7 as a higher percentage (70-60 if I remember right in the scoring to the other two). They praise the LS' interior quiet and jump on MB a bit for not being as quiet then score them the same way. I don't think there is any bias there (the scoring was unfair to all three cars in different instances), just a general inconsistency (the two I gave are just references - there are plenty more amongst the three cars) and when i see that I don't take the data seriously as no one is checking what is printed. I mean if I catch such mistakes with a 5 minute (if that) review than its obvious no one is edit checking them for a living.

2765,"October 7, 2003 2:14AM",boo20,"These are used SLs. No dealer has 35 NEW SLs in stock. Most have none. The ones that have 2003s in stock have been sold and bought back by the dealer and sold at, or above MSRP. Look at Ray Catena's website: http://www.catena.mercedescenter.com/mbcenter/b/index.jhtml. You can do a search and come up with five 2003 SLs. One has 15,000 miles and is still selling for (approx) MSRP. I know that this is a concept that is hard for non-MB enthusiasts to comprehend but let me explain to you how it works: Dealers sell these cars based upon a priority list (generally you have to get on it about 18 months in advance). They are driven a few thousand miles and then sold back to the dealer at or near MSRP. The dealer is then no longer constrained by MBUSA as to what they can charge for these cars and they go to the highest bidder. MB does not allow dealers to sell NEW cars above MSRP but they have no control over the used car market.

The rare NEW SL you will see at dealers is typically an SL55 which goes for 130 big ones. The market for these cars is small, almost as small as Ferrari.

The marketplace has basically spoken. I have never seen used Lexus vehicles go for MSRP. I have never heard of an 18 month waiting list for a Lexus.

On another point my comment about 80 year olds drving Lexi was clearly hyperbole and intended as a joke. Clearly, however, the demographics of a Lexus buyer is different than an MB: he's older and less affluent. There's nothing wrong with that but it helps to explain Lexus' marketing strategy. I think Lexus' main competitor is Cadillac and not Mercedes. <JOKE>Who else would want to drive a car that looks like a coffin (and when your time comes you don't even have to get out of the car! )</JOKE>

Incidentally, studies have shown that people spend about 4 months gross salary on a new car. With this perspective Carpoints stats are right on target (which makes me believe their demographic data is accurate): So for an average yearly income of 186 K Lexus buyers purchase a 60 K car (4 months income). At an average income of 286 K MB (S 500) buyers pay about 90 K (again 4 months income)."

They do have lower defects per 100 than many other manufacturers, including MB. The detail data are available to the auto manufacturers...for a big price tag. The reason you do hear of some detail data (like the Hummer stuff) is that when the press reports on JDP, they will mention a few items that contributed to the poor ratings for manufacturers that didn't fare so well in the surveys. They don't happen to mention the items that the more reliable brands had problems with. It doesn't mean, as you can tell from the aggregate problems per 100 data, that Lexus or Acura have zero problems. Nor does it mean that the surveys fail to catch the problems that show up in Lexus or Acura cars.

On average, models by domestic automakers outperform the Europeans by 49 problems per 100 (PP100) vehicles at three years of ownership.

Examples: A 45 year old business school classmate of mine sold his company in March, 2001 and personally cleared $440 million. Drives: LS430. A 65 year old real estate executive with 6,000 apartment portfolio - S430; his 41 year old son, S500. I could go on.

My former classmate with the LS430 also has a 911 Turbo in the garage which is his ""fun to drive"" car. His opinion, the LS430 is 90%+ the luxury auto of the S500, with 0% of the maintenance headaches and hassles. He values his time very highly and if he's going to have hassles, it will be over a sports car like the 911 rather than his daily driver luxury sedan. In spite of his success, he has no apparant ego need to flaunt it.

In my circles, the number of people who buy an LS430 (or Q45) because they can't afford an S500 is less than the number who have drifted away from the Mercedes brand over quality control and reliability issues over the past few years.

An interesting calculation: with his net worth of $46b, if we included EVERY LS and S owner in a demographic analysis, Bill would, all by his lonesome, skew the LS average (mean) net worth upward by $230k! (I am assuming 200k LSs on US roads, which is just a guess based on a 2003 run-rate of 20k or so cars. I am also assuming that he no longer owns an MB...I know he once did, before the LS, but don't know if it was an S or if he sold it.)

They are not even remotely close. Anyone can put out a financial tool linking car price to some income threshhold but that hardly means that is who the car is being sold or marketed to. Secondly as syswei states why does it even have any relevance. For what it's worth someone I know well in the $100mln+ wealth range has an LS430, an LX470, 3 old MB's from the late 70's to the late 80's (two of which are SL's) and a VW beetle.

These stats have little to do with who can afford what car. Income should not be confused with wealth, which are two different things.

Somebody may have an income of $300,000 but also have two mortgages, car payments, credit card debt, very little in the bank, etc. They may only be able to afford an Accord. They have a big income but would not be considered wealthy.

On the flip side, somebody may make $100,000 but have no mortgage or any other debt with lots of money saved up. This person could easily buy most any car with cash.

I think both the Lex and the S (and others discussed here) are the type of car people with high yearly incomes consider, because I think they target primarily business customers - a large sedan seldom is a choice out of passion.

It seems to me that the people who are attracted to Cadillac would also be attracted to the Lexus.

As far as selling new cars it may be true that MBUSA cannot legally compel its dealer network to sell them at or below MSRP they CAN exert considerable ""influence"" on them by regulating the allocation to each dealership. If this were not the case how can you otherwise explain the shenanigans going on with the SLs where they are sold back to the dealer with 15,000 miles and resold at MSRP? This is a common ccurence with MBs and rare or nonexistent with Lexus. 18 month waiting lists are also unheard of in Lexus country. Buyers selling their waiting list position for cash to more eager buyers is also common with the more popular MB models and would be laughed at by Lexus where you can go into any dealership and buy these cars right off of the lot. There's a reason that MBs are much more desirable than Lexi. Some of us have figured this out already.

I am still waiting for an answer to the question I posed previously: what would happen to LS430 sales if they raised the price of their vehicles to the level of the S class? Would they sell more or fewer vehicles? My guess is that their sales would plummet. Why would that be if the LS430 is as good or better than the S?

And none grew up as a kid in a family where the parents aspired to own Lexus. That&#146;s a handicap that constrains pricing.

What other company besides MB could get away with charging $10,700 for a designo edition (S500) that basically gives you some unusual color choices (unusual for the US, they are apparently standard in some other countries) for exterior and interior, plus a wood/leather steering wheel and shift knob (which are standard on even on the base LS)?

If you slapped a Lexus badge on a G500 it would sell very few, perhaps close to zero, units. Even the car rags suggested such in their reviews...that for the price the G had little to offer except the three-pointed star.

If you put a Lexus badge on the S and tried to sell it at its currently high prices, it would sell fewer units.

Conversely if you slapped a MB badge on a LS without raising the price, it would sell lots more units."

As we business folk know, stretching 10 year trends to a century is questionable. Many things can happen. It'll be interesting to see which brands are still around in a century. That is speculation.

> what Lexus has achieved in 12 years is stupendous

That, of course, is absolutely true. Lexus is a no-doubt bone-fide luxury player. Globally, though, the MB brand name still carries far more value, and car marketing folk claim it's Merc and Porsche which have the highest global brand equity. And given the mismanagement of Merc in the last 12 years, that is a testament to a powerful brand name and mass psychology...

> Plus Lexus builds the cars more efficiently
> and hence has a lower cost of goods than MB.

I am not sure if it's still the case, but I thought histrocially Merc's margins are way higher than Toyota's. They've both managed to run up huge losses as of late, so for now it's a bit of a moot point.

> MB has been forced to lower prices. What does
> that tell you?

Not a lot, since lowering prices can be done for a variety of stratgic business goals, and MB still has more than enough models that sell at $90k plus - more so than any other vendor. The fact they've managed to hang in competitively despite compromised ""design for excellence"" benchmarks also says a lot about the other players. It is obvious Merc made a decision to build their core models to a cost point, and no longer to an uncompromised standard, which allowed them to lower prices and benefit from the trend towards ""luxury for the masses"" which they for a large degree initiated. If there's a brand that knows how to exploit their brand equity, it's MB, no question about it.

End customer perception always lags market reality for a while, and I wonder how long it'll take consumers to realize MB and BMW and others are increasingly creeping downmarket, and when it'll dillute the true luxury perception..."

Couldn't be more wrong, if that were the case the much cheaper LS would have ran the S-Class off the market long time ago. They don't drive the same, nor do look and feel the same. The vast differences of opinion (from owners too) on this board should illustrate that to you. I don't expect anyone from the Lexus crowd to understand anything about chasis dynamics as it's not as important as stereos and nav systems. Yes these two cars are similiar in mission but how they get there is different.

You're really surprising me with the theory that a waiting lists is a bad thing. Now if I go to the LS topic I can find ""The first 2 months worth are sold out"". What is that? Saying that a waiting list is a bad thing is sheer resentment over the fact that Lexus doesn't have one. Lexus wishes the SC430 had a following like the SL. BTW, the ES300, LS430 all had slight ""waiting lists"" when they were first introduced no? I'm sure the RX330 has one now too. People that want a car like a SL, SC430, Ferrari, or even a 350Z don't go anywhere in a month or so, if that were the case these car's sales would fall flat 6 months after their introduction. People have been waiting since the mid-nineties for a new SL, ditto for a new coupe from Lexus, as both of their predecessors rans for years and years. So when a new one comes out all these people who've been wanting for a new SC or SL for years are going to walk because they have to wait a few more months. I know you don't really believe that. It's not like this group needs a car per say either. A waiting list is the best thing any carmaker can have in todays market. It means you have a hot product. BTW, good design last as the previous SL had its best sales year well into it's production run, like around it's 6th or 7th model year. Though Lexus will never attain that, their previous SC430 was a highly reguarded car that many Lex fans were anxiously awaiting it's replacement. They aren't going to walk away from purchasing a SC430 because of a waiting list, because of it's design compared to the old car possibly, but not because of a waiting list.

syswei,

I'm not blindly trusting a survey like you're doing. You think they're the end-all for car ownership and they aren't. You missed the point about the Acura and Lexus transmission problems. When Benz owners come in here and post about a problem its seen as an epidemic, but when an Acura TL or Lexus ES owner says something about a transmission failure it's not even mentioned. There is also a need for a clear definition as to what exactly qualifies as a repair as a opposed to maintanence. How you can you put so much faith in something and you don't even know the criteria they use (JDP)? It doesn't make sense.

Also on the trans problem. Your thinking doesn't even allow for the possibility that not everyone who had a trans failure got a survey in the first place. There are millions of cars sold here every year and you're drawing a conclusion based on 50,000 of them, spread out among more than a few brands. No where did I state that the survey wouldn't ask about the engine/transmission, i.e. drivetrain of the car. Why twist what I stated? I said that if the problems were as widespread as they seem, by reading this board, then Acura and Lexus should have been affected more because (per you) these surveys are always correct and flawless.

I think I already agreed with you that designo editions were not worth the money, so you're repeating it for....?

You Lexus guys are really going to have to get a better grasp on all this data you all love to post about. ""Days supply""...traditionally meant how many cars are in the U.S. sales pipeline, not how many cars are on the dealer's lots. Do you really think all, or even the smallest fraction of the 300+ Mercedes dealers in the U.S. have 12+ days supply of SLs on their lots? Thats about as far fetched as thinking one dealer has 35 SLs in stock.

The old standard of ""days supply"" means that under normal conditions they'll sell all the SLs in both ports (Jersey, Cali) in 12 days. If you can find more than 2 or 3 A8s on any Audi dealers lot you get a gold Audi ring set. JDP really needs to stop it with these bs factoids. Anyone who knows anything about cars could tell you that their list of cars/suvs/vans are all the ""hot"" ones right now. Any one of these brands aren't going to have many if any of these models in stock, especially the luxury cars.
______

I'm hesitant to join in on the demographics debate again, but I think overall it's the type of car (i.e. price, size, luxury first or sport first, or a good mix of, etc) that dictates the ""demographic"" as to who will be looking at it. Secondly it would be the brand and it's heritage, name recognition etc. In either case it's probably less than 5 years that seperate the LS and S from each other, as both are older than the guys looking at 7-Series BMWs.

2805,"October 8, 2003 11:14PM",bluestar1,"my .02cents worth

I think it is interesting to read boo20 assert that LS owners or buyers are LESS affluent than S500 buyers, simply bcos of the price difference b/w these two cars. So what is a $30K difference in monthly lease payment ? What ? Another $500/mth ?

Seriously though, Mercedes higher price is based on the marque brand name recognition, and aspirations of many people wanting to own a Mercedes. That is the heritage that Lexus lacks, hence Lexus must price below Merc to achieve market share. What is most noteworthy is that Lexus market growth is at the expense of Mercedes. Therein lies the greatest danger Merc faces. The longer Lexus remains at the top of most surveys, the longer Lexus continues to innovate with cutting-edge techno-gizmos, and revolutionize the car industry with hybrid SUV's, the longer Lexus builds it marque-ness, and I dare say, the pricier Lexus will become.

In 15 years, I will think that Lexus will be at par with Mercedes in brand name recognition. It is inevitable giving the divergent directions both car makers are taking lately. Toyota/Lexus innovating and racking in big profits, and DCX getting bogged down with its ill-planned merger with money-losing Chrysler Corp. By the time Mercedes rids itself of DC, it will be way too late and their present problems will catch up. Sooner or later.

Yes, Lexus may be a *copy* of Merc, but a darn good one, for a lot less. I'd gladly pay less for more, unless my ego is the size of Planet Holywood Well, Merc would you pay MORE for LESS ?"
2806,"October 9, 2003 12:22AM",merc1,"I think that generally speaking people buying a car that ranges from 55-72 are little less deep in the pockets than people looking at a car that starts at 73K and goes to 125K. Yes there is some overlap for sure, but to say its the same exact demographic I think is incorrect.

Yes Lexus has grown market share, but its been at the expense of every import luxury brand on the market, not just Mercedes. Mercedes is on a sales roll also these days. The whole market exanded somewhere in the 1990's to the point where Lexus, Mercedes and BMW sigularly sell more cars than all three combined did just a few years earlier.

I seriously doubt Lexus will ever be even with Mercedes in name, simply because Lexus doesn't have the lineup. The ""wow"" AMG cars add a lot of luster to the Mercedes brand as do cars like the SLR. There seems to be this theory that Mercedes is forever reaching downmarket and that couldn't be more incorrect. If anything they are trying to cover all aspects of the market. Yes they have a 25K hatchback, but they also have a 350K+ exotic coming and the Maybach is already here, which everyone knows is just a super Mercedes. Mercedes' next round of new cars/suvs are not downmarket: CLS/E (which I hope they change before production), GST, ML and the next G-Wagen are all upscale products. Not to mention that the next S is supposed to move a few notches as well.

Until Lexus gets some diversity, like true 4-seat convertibles, coupes, wagons, awd, performance variants, etc, they'll never reach Mercedes' brand recognition level overall. Mercedes' appeal goes far beyond what we all regularly debate here too. Racing plays a part in it for a few AMG buyers. If Mercedes could wrestle a Formula One title away from Ferrari you'd hear about it all year long with special F1 versions of various Mercedes models. They've done this before. Lexus simply doesn't compete on the world stage.

There is no way Mercedes is going to let Chrysler pull them down the tubes, they'll cut them loose before Mercedes suffers.

2807,"October 9, 2003 12:43AM",boo20,"bluestar1: I didn't say MB S class owners were more affluent than LS430 owners because the car is more expensive. I said that because the demographic data presented on Carpoint listed the average yearly income of Lexus LS430 owners as 186 K and that of S class owners as 286 K. If you consider that in each case the car cost about 1/3 their respective yearly income that makes perfect sense given what we know about what people feel comfortable spending for a car. Let me also point out that the fact that SOME LS430 owners can also afford an S class is irrelevant. The point is a simple one. Let me spell it out for you: If car A is more expensive than car B than everyone who owns car A could also have purchased car B. But the opposite is not true. I.e., invariably there will be people who could afford car B (because it's less expensive) but not car A. Substitute A for MB and B for Lexus.

skinnygboss: You stated ""He also went on to say that overall, the highest single percentage of a car make traded in on a Lexus is a Lexus."" My point was that when people mostly trade in a Lexus for a Lexus how do you know what they previously drove before their first trade in for the Lexus? How do you know what 'market segment' they were shopping in?

As far as waiting lists is concerned I think it is good (for MB) that MB has unmet demand. It enforces pricing at MSRP for the dealer ensuring higher profits. It maintains a mystyque for the brand. People have actually been forced to wait 18 months or more for their cars. Says alot about brand loyalty and the dersirability of these cars that they don't jump ship and buy something else. Of course when the option is buying the hideous SC I would wait (indefinately if necessary) for the SL. Thank you very much.

Do me a favor. Go into any MB dealer and ask him to show you his 12 day inventory of NEW SLs. Say to him ""Sir, let me see your 12 day inventory of new SLs. They said on Edmunds that I could pick one up right away."" LOL!! What's a 12 day inventory of SLs anyway? The monthly sales of the previous generation SL was about 1000 cars. For the 2003 its probably less. How many MB dealers are there in the US? I don't know maybe 300. They'll each sell an average of 3 SLs per month or one every 10 days. So a 12 day ""inventory"" of SLs is like ONE CAR. (and it's probably an SL55)!"

There was some negative reaction to the S class's styling and also a problem with the tires flatspotting due to the weight of the car.

The tankish, bank vault S-Class (W140) came out for 1992. It was the one that had problems with it's tires. This generation of MB engineers hadn't build a car so heavy and big before and they misjudged the tire required.

There is something to be said about Mercedes' prices back in the day. For that same 76.5K that the 300CE Cabrio listed for back in 1993, you can get within 4K of a new CLK55 AMG Cabriolet. Quite a difference in cars. An AMG version of the old car would have been a 100K at least. The 300CE Cabriolet's equivalent today is the 52K CLK320 Cabriolet. The only thing the old 300CE/E320 Cabrio (arguably) has on the new cars is it's build. The performance and technology difference is like night and day. Still that particular E-Class was such the definition of Mercedes back in the day, it's a classic.

My response is: how can you put MORE faith in the anecdotes that are related on boards like this one? Anecdotes that are few in number and that are from self-selected individuals?

No one has ever said that Acura or Lexus or any other brand is problem-free. And some of the problems that people have do show up in these boards. But to judge whether, for the entire population of cars, one brand is more ""problematic"" than another one, you need a large, randomly-selected sample. Which is what JDP, not these boards, gives you.

 It is inevitable ..""

Speculation. It is not inevitable, it is not a foregone conclusion, and car makers' ability to execute to a standard of exellence for 25 years has often been tested by history, and most have failed. All credit to Lexus for where they are today - but none of us has a crystal ball, let's be honest here.

Besides, one thing that will keep on hampering the Lexus image of hyper-luxury is the lack of true $100k+ ""superstar"" cars. Merc understands that is integral to the ""lower range"" desirability, which is why they crank out such a variety of super-cars: the press keeps reviewing them, they keep enforcing the image of the top of the range that most people only dream about. Lexus will always be perceived a notch below that, and given the fact they didn't come from the very top down, unlike most of these brands, it'll be hard for them to crack that image.

Moreover - they don't need to. They have loyal customers, and there are plenty of people that seem to appreciate Lexus for what it represents: superb Japanese engineering ability combined with a very plush and luxurious driving environment. If there's one criticism I have of German brands, it it the teutonic chilliness of their interiors. Look at a $100k plus Merc or Porsche, and compare the interiors with a Bentley Continental or even a $70k Range Rover - they can't hold a candle to them. And I think it's one of the reasons Lexus managed to break into the top realm: they offered a plusher interior wihtout foring people to go for Cadillac-esque driving dynamics."

The current argument is so skewed in the direction of merely criticizing the other brands, and over-praising one's own brand of choice, that it's become childish. We *know* owners are more critical than that, and that this illusion about this or that supposedly being the perfect car that has to be conjured up to defend it from criticism is unrealistic.

As for the ""merits"" of all these cars, I for one have been extremely pleased with the reliability and lack of unscheduled maintenance with the M5. In 33,000 miles, it was only to the dealer once for a little item in the first week of ownership. The M5 has been no less relaible than the 540i 6-speed I traded in for it and comes darn close to the same mileage (24+ highway). Makes me want to petition for a refund of the $2,200 gas guzzler I paid. Our Range Rover is lucky to get 15 mog on the highway.

As a former owner of an M1, 930 Turbo and 300 SEL 6.3, I am increasingly impressed with the fact that exceptional performance can also be reliable with todays ""M"" cars, Porsches and AMG offerings.

There was an article about the merger in the 9/29 edition of Business Week. The headline reads ""Was the Daimler-Chrysler merger a mistake? Many say yes and call for Schrempp's head.""

Some of the problems:
1. Chrysler was supposed to make $2 billion this year. Instead it will have a $1 billion loss in the 2nd quarter to pull down the year.
2. The latest surveys ""revealed embarrassing quality deficiencies at Mercedes itself, raising questions about whether the drain on management from Chrysler was affecting the classiest of German marques.""

Other bits from the article:

Daimler market capitalization prior to the merger was $47 billion. Today it is $38 billion. BMW in that same time is up 27% to $25 billion.

Daimler erred in merging luxury and mass--market brands since it offers limited benefits and requires twice the expertise and effort to manage.

Under German management Chrysler's US share has fallen from 16% to 13%. Shoring up Chrysler will require Daimler to add billions, resulting in some Mercedes dealers calling Chrysler ""the downfall of Mercedes.""

In order to cut costs Mercedes has resorted to buying cheaper parts, including leather from Bulgaria.

The S class has never had an order backlog as has some of MBs ""sexier"" models: CL, SL etc. or even its bread and butter E class whose price point is more in line with what the average luxury car buyer is willing (or able) to spend. As I've indicated before the LS is not in the same league as the S class. People shopping for the LS would generally choose between that and an E class. They are much closer in price and the demographics of the E class buyer is more in line with that of the LS. If you are looking for an LS you really should be looking at the E class. Right now the waiting list extends to March for the E class so good luck. It's really an unfair comparison to put up the LS as a competitor to the S class. The latter is a more sophisticated vehicle (and appeals to a more sophisticated buyer) than the former.

Whether you are interested in buying an SL or not is not pertinent. My point simply is that MB is a very desirable brand and that several of their vehicles (even the 2004 E class) has a waiting list. The conclusion I draw from this is that, quality issues notwithstanding, many people find these cars to be very desirable and are willing to wait long periods of time and to pay MSRP.

They sell MB, BMW, Porsche etc. Natives of this area know who I am talking about. Anyway one of the saleman there told me that MB and BMW buyers were fundamentally different, in his experience, in that BMW buyers frequently lease their cars whereas MB buyers usually pay cash. Take a look at the leasing board here on Edmunds. Although unscientific, questions about leasing BMWs far exceeds that of questions about MB leasing. I have paid cash for all of my cars in the past 20 years (including the 3 MBs I have had over the past 9 years.) I could continue to do the same. Nevertheless I have seriously considered leasing my next S class because 1) a new model comes out in 2005 and I would be gambling as to what the market for the current generation S will be when I trade it in 2) my cost of ownership is KNOWN ahead of time. I.e., no haggling with the dealer about my trade in 3) I don't have to write as big a check all at once and it makes it seem as if I'm not spending my money with such reckless abandon (even though I am 4) I have two cars and thus drive less than 10 K miles per vehicle per year and generally take good care of my vehicles 5) I don't like the idea of keeping my cars beyond the manufacturers warantee period etc. Because of these considerations I think that many people who could afford to purchase outright choos to lease instead. So I thought of doing a pre-paid lease. However, when I looked the amount of interest that I would be paying on the residual I had second thoughts about it. Clearly buying outright is cheaper in the long run.

Anyway to answer your question, although I don't know what the percentages of lux cars are leased my guess is that it is a minority. And, yes, there are huge numbers of very sucessful people out there. Consider that 1% of families (about 1 million familes I guess) have a declared annual income of greater than $500,000 per year. And that's according to the IRS. The underground economy is several fold larger than this and I'm sure there is a HUGE amount of undeclared income.

2842,"October 10, 2003 11:07AM",syswei,"Just my opinion, but I think that we shouldn't over-read the importance of waiting lists and low inventories of cars. Waiting lists and low stock can reflect a number of things:

- desire by the manufacturer to keep up the brand image

- poor planning/forcasting of demand

- supply/manufacturing constraints

If the idea of looking at the waiting lists / dealer stock is to guage ""desirablility"" or ""popularity"", it is better to look at actual sales figures of comparable vehicles. By this measure the SL for example appears more ""desired"" or popular than the SC, for instance (outselling by about 11% in unit terms).

If you look across the entire product lines, Lexus outsells MB (adding cars and SUVs together), while MB does better in cars and Lexus does better in SUVs."

As far as reliability is concerned consider this. I will be spending more time in the shop for repairs of my MB and you will be spending more time in the shop for scheduled maintanence. Because of superior engine technology (compared to Lexus) MB vehicle maintanence averages once a year and 12,000 miles and can be as long as 2 years or 20,000 miles.

Alot of people here seem to think that we have to get our MBs towed everytime we drive them. LOL. Since I bought my first MB in late '93 ('94 model) I have NEVER been stranded. The two MBs that I own now have rarely seen the inside of the shop outside of scheduled maintenance.

Keep away from the sport package and avoid the stiffer ride. Brakes alone are a reason to get the 'bimmer. Although, the X5 weighs 500 lb. more than the RX (and is a great deal more sturdy) its stopping distance in a 0-70 panic stop is about 2 car lengths shorter. The V6 in the toyota is not as smooth running as the inline 6 in the 'bimmer. Lower entry height in the BMW makes it easier to get in and out of.

Anyway my main point is that the public percieves Mercedes as very desirable cars. This in spite of the fact that it is more expensive and less reliable than Lexus. Why do you think that is? Why are people willing to wait 2 years for an unreliable MB when they could just as well walk in and get a Toyota (er..Lexus.

Haven't we been over this? MB has higher prestige/snob appeal, and that matters a great deal to some people. Some, myself included, think it has better exterior styling. It offers a wider range of sportiness (i.e., base S, S with Sport package, AMG S55) which is preferred by some. Finally, it has a much broader product line in cars (not SUVs)...click on the ""model selector"" feature on their website and there are fully 33(!) car variations...whereas Lexus has just 8.

So it is no surprise that MB still outsells Lexus in cars (again, not SUVs). If they keep up the lousy work in the quality/reliability department (where they were number 1 in 1990) that standing may not last indefinitely."

2870,"October 10, 2003 8:24PM",sv7887,"Hi All,

I'd like to address the following:

""As far as reliability is concerned consider this. I will be spending more time in the shop for repairs of my MB and you will be spending more time in the shop for scheduled maintanence. Because of superior engine technology (compared to Lexus) MB vehicle maintanence averages once a year and 12,000 miles and can be as long as 2 years or 20,000 miles.""

Superior Engine Technology? I think not...I only take my cars in for service every 15,000 miles. Check the Lexus maintenance schedule before you make statements like that. The car, like practically any other, requires an Oil change every 5000-7500 miles. Any decent mechanic will tell you frequent oil changes are probably one of the best things you can do for you car. Obviously, the Duration depends on how much you drive.

I'd bet my maintenance costs for my 1992 LS400 are lower than any comparable luxury car of that year. $3,200 over 11 yrs. That's $290/ yr. As for spending time in the shop...Never been stranded ever. It's all been routine and I was provided a loaner car each time. They even pick up the car and drop off the loaner.

Don't you think those infrequent service intervals have something to do with MB's spotty record these days?

As for the Seven Speed Issue...Don't you think this is overkill? I don't see anyone else rushing to adopt a 7 Speed Transmission. Even a high performance car like a Corvette, Aston Martin Vanquish, and Porsche 911 only have six speeds and can probably beat anything MB has to offer.

Incorporating a Seven speed transmission is just more Marketing fodder for the MB bull sessions that we repeatedly hear on this board. Why hasn't Lexus built one? They don't see a need for it. That's the key to the bulletproof reliability of their cars. They don't implement needless technology and complicated designs.

I'll leave the ""waiting list"" issue to the rest of the Lexus loyalists here.

SV"
2871,"October 10, 2003 8:45PM",ljflx,"I have read so many of your posts putting Lexus down everywhere you can for reasons only you could possibly know. Just as an example look at the E-class board at your post 5232. This is probably the post skinnygboss was referring to earlier today. You imply that any Lexus can be had at steep discounts while people get in line for MB's. You then hedge yourself by quoting waiting lists for the low production cars (the E is the exception and no one buys a 6 month wait let alone a 6 week one)and compare that to all Lexus cars. So do I sense an exaggeration. Yep - big time. Those hefty discounts are on 2003's just like the ones MB dealers and the rest of the car world are discounting to sell.

What I'm curious about are the putdowns. Does bashing Lexus make you feel better about your purchase or yourself? Can you not deal with how quickly and effectively Lexus penetrated the US market? Does the quote - which I've heard often about other things like ""it's as reliable as a Lexus"" bother you to no end? Anyway - and to be honest with you - it's all rather pointless because both brands are heavily desirable and comparisons to MSRP have to include a lot more than desirability anyway. They include everything from production and inventory controls to flexibility of pricing a manufacturer allows his dealer (Lexus is broad, MB is tight) and a lot of things in between. So let's put an end to these fruitless, rather tiring and most certainly boring points."
2872,"October 10, 2003 8:46PM",boo20,"syswei: you stated on post #3104 that ""I have news for you. The 2004 E does not come with the 7 speed.""

Well I have news for YOU. Here's a window sticker from an '04 E class car . The very first item on the upper left lists the 7-speed transmission as a standard feature of the '04 E 500.

sv7887: you state ""The car, like practically any other, requires an Oil change every 5000-7500 miles. "".

Yes EXCEPT for MB. The oil changes are done on average every 12,000 miles but can range from 10,000 to 20,000 miles depending on driving conditions. These conditions are determined by computer sensors which constantly monitor the quality and quantity of oil. The system is called FSS (flexible service system).

You also state ""As for the Seven Speed Issue...Don't you think this is overkill? ...Incorporating a Seven speed transmission is just more Marketing fodder for the MB bull sessions that we repeatedly hear on this board. Why hasn't Lexus built one?""

I see. So if the MB seven speed transmission is overkill why is Lexus going from a 5 speed to a six speed transmission?

The rationale behind the seven speed is twofold. It improves gas milage by about 5% AND AT THE SAME TIME improves 0 - 60 times by about 0.3 seconds. Tests of passing ability such as going from 40 - 70 mph are improved by 2 - 3 SECONDS! If you can get better performance AND fuel economy at the same time then why not?

ljflx: where exactly, other than my criticism of Lexus styling, have I shown disrepect for the car?"
2873,"October 10, 2003 8:59PM",ljflx,I'm done with this exchange. Just go read your own posts.
2874,"October 10, 2003 9:14PM",boo20,"I'm not trying to be argumentative. I have acknowledged that Lexus makes more reliable cars.

I like the styling, safety and innovaton of MB and think that the reliability question, although real and measurable, is not important. Also my personal experience is that MBs are reliable. I guess I must be lying about this too, huh?

Here's an example where MB leads Lexus in innovation and safety. In the '04 S class e.g., MB has introduced ""pre-safe"", a feature where, if the onbaord computers detect a hazardous situation, they will automatically lower the rear part of the drivers seat and simultaneously raise the front part of the drivers seat to prevent submarining under the seatbelt. The sunrroof will also close automatically etc.

I've really approached these discussions in good faith. I've tried to explain some MB features to the readers. When I stated that the '04 E class has a seven speed transmission I was told this isn't true. When I documented that it is, indeed, true I was told it wasn't an important feature and was just a ""marketing ploy"". When I showed why it was important I'm now anticipating the response that ""OK, it's present on the '04 E class AND it's a useful feature BUT MB reliability will be so poor that it won't work."" You keep changing the bar and changing the subject.

I'll tell you what: if you want I'll just withdraw from these discussions. Then the Lexus people can have the floor all to themselves, not hear any contrary opinon and spend all of their time massaging each others egos and complimenting each other on the great decision they have made."
2875,"October 10, 2003 9:51PM",oac3,"7-speed tranny is not a biggie as you make it to be. So it improves gas mileage by a whopping 5%. Whopsie doo... So what REAL difference b/w an 0-60 of 6.1s and 5.8s. Both times are FAST enough.

It's the little things that are getting left behind by Mercedes, hence the deteriorating reliability of their high-priced cars/SUV's. Lexus got it right in the little things, hence riding high in the reliability sector. Design ? That is in the eye of the beholder. Nothing wrong with the 1st and 2nd gen LS's. I don't particularly like the '01-'03 redesign, but the small changes to the '04 makes a huge improvement. I cannot wait for the MY 2006 redesign, which hopefully will be based on the HPX platform."
2876,"October 10, 2003 10:07PM",ljflx,"I'm not one that knocks MB cars. They make spectacular cars and they are number one in innovation - both on the safety side and they push the envelope on the automotive side. But they have suffered a great fall in reliability. It's posted and quoted everywhere and just about everyone I know has had problems with MB cars in the past several years and a number of those people have switched over to Lexus. My experience is the same that Donn Fenn posted a few days ago. CR, JDP and now even Germans themselves in a JDP survey are rating MB quality lower and lower. If MB loyalists choose to belittle those surveys that is their perogative. But the damage from them will show up in the future unless it is fixed soon - you can bet the value of your car on that. Perception always takes a while to catch up with reality but inevitably it does. People aren't dumb they are just hesitant to change their views. Look at the stock market for proof of that.

I'm a person that believes you fix what is broken before you make new innovations. MB has not had too many things that were broken in the past so they've never been down this road. But continuing to lead innovation at a time when buyers are showing lowering quality numbers doesn't go well together long-term. This is all happening in the last 5 years and it seems to be worsening. That doesn't mean it is happening to every MB car buyer just like it doesn't mean every Lexus car buyer is getting the bulletproof car they thought they signed on for.

So do they make great automotive cars - yes. Would I buy an $88k S-500 over a $67k LS430 (which, by the way also has a pre-safe collision option in 2004). No, not me. It's not the price its the fact that the Lexus is the better car for me. As well I'm used to perfection and I have full confidence in the Lexus and not a lot of confidence in the MB.

Sometimes, I wonder where you get your &#147;facts&#148;. Do go into a local MB dealership, talk to a salesman, and then make the dual mistakes of (1) believing everything a salesman tells you, and (2) assuming it applies to all dealerships?

I found a MB dealer, Power Automotive in CA, that seems to have an online realtime inventory. Maybe there are other MB dealerships that do this, this is just the first I ran across. Go to &#147;Find a New Vehicle&#148; here: http://www.autonation.com/Content/HubNewInventory.asp?SiteId=430 to check the facts; this particular dealer has in stock (as of the time of this post):

36 E&#146;s, including 18 2004&#146;s

4 SL&#146;s, including 3 SL500 and 1 SL55

So, are you going to stand by your original statement, that &#147;every E-class car coming into a US port for the next 6 months is already sold&#148;. Do you still doubt the 12-day AVERAGE SL supply figure, gathered from a survey of 3000 dealers (don&#146;t know how many MB dealers)?

7-speeds do seem in shorter supply at Power Auto, but I think this has something to do with MB&#146;s late delivery of 7-speeds. I noticed that as of a couple days ago, the MB website had info on all the 2004 models except the ones that come with the 7-speed, like the S and SL. It is only in the last couple days that they added this info. This might mean the cars with 7-speeds are on a later delivery schedule than cars with 5-speeds, like the E320.

Slightly changing the subject, your original post on the E was: &#147;The reason the '04 E class are sold out and there is a surplus of '03s is because the '04s are percieved as being worthwhile waiting for by virtue of the new 7 speed transmission.&#148; Since you said &#147;E class&#148; rather than E500, I didn&#146;t check both the E320 and E500, only the E320, which for 2004 still has the 5-speed transmission. I was wrong to assume that this applied to the entire E-class. But can you see why this happened? Your original post made it seem like ALL 2004 E&#146;s had the 7-speed, which is not true."

Look I have been shopping these cars for many years. When I say that a new model introduction requires a wait list, sometimes up to 2 years, I mean it. I tried to get a CLK when it first came out about 6 years ago and you had to put your name on a list. I tried to get an SL500 (R230)when it first came out but had to get on a list. When the SLK was introduced there was no dealer stock for the first 2 years or so and, guess what, you had to get on a list.

Power Auto is actually part of AutoNation, and if you go to their national site, http://www.autonation.com/Corporate/Default.asp?Page=Home, you&#146;ll see that they have 11 MB dealerships in total, and that between them they have 32 SLs in stock, or 2.9 per dealerabout a 27-day supply."

Mercedes:
Soul ***

Summary: Consistent, but avoids extremes by design. Their diesels and some lower end models (not in the US line-up) continue to have legendary longevity.

Lexus:

Interior ****
Reliability *****
Service *****
Summary: Slanted towards trouble free experience and coziness. Great service experience.

BMW:

2883,"October 11, 2003 10:12AM",boo20,"Well if that's the case then these cars are just now starting to become available. I've been shopping for several years and most of the new models require being placed on a waiting list. I would understand how that is hard to believe for a mass marketer like Toyota but it's a fact. After a variable period of time these cars do become widely available in stock but it takes awhile.

Indeed, just the other day I posted a link to an MB forum (that was removed by Pat) in which someone just took delivery of a 2004 SL500 after a 2 YEAR WAIT. This is precisely the reason I did not want to place myself on a waiting list. They are so long with the introduction of new models that by the time you get your car they are widely available at the showroom. This appears to be what is happening now with the SL but the R230 has been out quite awhile already.

It's pretty clear to me that none of the Lexus ethusiasts here have ever tried to get a more popular MB model. They have never shopped for an SL, CL, CLK, SLK etc at their introduction or, in some cases, within, a few years.

There is a good reason for this: people desire these cars to an extent that Lexus could only dream about.

Oh, by the way, have you heard about the ""cornering xenons"" that MB is introducing in some of the '04 models. This faeture actually turns the headlights INTO a turn so as to better illuminate the path of the vehicle. This will have Lexus playing catchup once again.

Oh, I know. Don't bother to tell me: like the 7G transmission it's not considered to be worthwhile feature by the Lexus people (who surprisingly can't get it). Still waiting on an answer to my question as to why Lexus has upgraded to a 6 speed transmission if the current 5 speed is good enough."

MB invented the automobile. Chrysler, by contrast, wasn't even on the distant horizon. Chrysler does not design MB cars. Toyota designs and builds the Lexus. In fact Lexus is basically a big Toyota and is marketed as such in Japan where their populaton is not so naive as to believe otherwise.

And I'm not even sure that Lexus was first with this. So, did MB ""copy"" and ""play catchup"" with Lexus (or whoever was first)?

As far as the 7-speed transmission, I for one see it as a valuable incremental innovation. But it is downright silly to assume that Lexus introduced a 6-speed as a direct competitive response solely directed at MB. Auto transmissions over the years went from 3 speed to 4 to 5 to 6/7. It takes YEARS of engineering work make any one of those jumps. Only a fool would believe that Lexus heard about the MB 7-speed and then started a crash program to go to 6-speed, and managed to get it to market so quickly. No, it is much more reasonable to assume that Lexus assumed the industry would progress from 5, to 6, to 7, etc and has had long-running development programs intended to keep pace with the industry, and competitors like MB, BMW, Audi, etc generally, not the MB 7 specifically.

By the way, since you are so impressed with the acceleration and fuel-economy benefits of the 7-speed, what are you going to say when Lexus is the first in the industry with hybrid powertrains? Hybrid technology is going to give acceleration and fuel-economy benefits that make the 7-speed benefits look like small change. Just wait and see."

The reason for wait lists is easy: no one wants to keep a large inventory of $30k items, the concept of ""just in time"" manufacturing is integral to car makers' ability to compete. These are rule *all* of the discussed vendors abide by, and it's idiotic to try to claim it detracts from one or the other vendors' appeal. And it's very easy for demand to outsize supply initially, since many customers put in their orders before cars are available, and the early fashinability of the model or sustained desirability adds to that. It would be suicidal and stupid of vendors to size production numbers to cope with that initial demand boost early in the model's lifetime."

In fact, the Merc dealer where my wife bought her car tried to sell me an SC430 they had at over MSRP at that early time, they'd scored it at somewhere and surely made a bundle on it.

Indicentally, wait lists are a dangerous game to play, because customers do grow tired of them and cancel orders left and right, wrecking havoc all around, and also test customers' patience. One of the reasosn Merc lost luxury sedan market share to the Beemer 7 series in Germany was the fact that MB had ridiculously long wait lists, and customers migrated over to the BMW dealerships at a time when BMW still had somewhat questionable luxury sedan appeal, put off by MB's wait lists.

I have cancelled cars that were on wait lists. I did want one of the early Minis, the dealer was an idiot, my order got delayed 6 months and I grew tired of waiting, and the novelty value had worn off anyhow. I for one will *never* wait 2 years for a car, it puts me off big time. I briefly considered a CL500 back in 2000, but when the dealer said 12 months I just laughed.

I said no such thing. What I did say is that when the SLK, CLK (which have been around quite a while) were introduced and for a few years afterwards there was a waiting list. Just as there has been (until recently apparantly) for the SL. Let's not even begin to discuss the issue of 7G-tronic transmssions where the bar is constantly being changed when you have been proved wrong. By contrast there is never a waiting list for the big Toyota.

Lexus is always playing catchup in technology. That along with its uninspired styling, reminicent more of a hearse than a luxury car, are two reasons that I don't see much of a future for Lexus in this market unless they get their act together.

By the way, does Lexus have all wheel drive on any of its sedans? No.

Does it have ANY car that competes with the incredible AMG designs (E55 469 HP, 0 - 60 4.5 sec)? No.

Does it make any high end vehicles like the S600, SL600 or CL600 (12 cylinder. all available for '04)? No.

But they do know how to make a good and reliable Toyota. I'll grant you that much. And at least, unlike some of their proponents, they know a Toyota (Lexus) when they see it.

NO IT DOESN'T.

Let's see Lexus' description of their ""pre-collision system"": ""The Pre-Collision (PCS) System [2] uses radar to detect possible obstacles ahead. Sensors then determine in advance whether a crash is unavoidable. Once an accident is calculated to be inevitable, a computer immediately activates the Pre-Collision seatbelt, which restrains the driver and front passenger, and the Pre-Collision brake assist, which applies maximum braking force once the brake pedal is pressed.""

Here is MBs description of their ""Pre-safe"" system: ""PRE-SAFE® helps prepare occupants for a possible collision before it occurs. If ESP and/or Brake Assist areactivated upon sensing certain vehicle dynamics that suggest an accident is possible but, according to system sensors, are not correcting the situation, PRE-SAFE snugs the front seat belts via electric tensioners, adjusts the front passenger seat (and rear seats, with 4-place seating package)2 for more favorable seat-belt and air-bag effectiveness, and (if a possible rollover is detected) closes the sunroof. If no collision occurs, PRE-SAFE reverses the front seat-belt tensioners, and occupants may re-adjust their seats and the sunroof.""

By ""adjusting the front passenger seats"" what pre-safe does is to prevent submarining by lowering the rear of the drivers seat cushion while simultaneously raising the front of the driver's seat. ""Brake assist"" is also a feature of all MBs whether they have the pre-safe feature or not.

Clearly the MB version is much more sophisticated and well thought out."

In it a high ranking exec of a company many of us have likely purchased from made the following statement. ""We're not first. We just do it better. We're not embarrassed to admit it. We've come out of nowhere to be the No. 3 consumer brand in the U.S. in less than 5 years, while Coca Cola has been doing it for 100 years. Of course, we're not in this to be No. 3. No.1 is the only target around here. Who's the company?

Dell.

How did they do it - they copied others and then innovated a new way of selling and manufacturing. They turned the whole industry on it's ear. This whole innovation issue and who is leading it is absurd in my opinion. Auto manufacturing is a business. There is nothing wrong with making another company be your R&D department. It's actually smart business. The company that changes the way an industry does things is the ultimate innovator. That is the big picture. Things like a pre-collision systems and the like are little parts of the story. Of course Dell did innovate one thing as I noted earlier - that is for sure. They changed the rules of how the game is played by selling a computer differently then anyone else and out of nowhere pulled ahead of the likes of IBM (the innovator of the open PC in the first place) and HP. That is called smart business.

Toyota was first with a commercial vehicle, the original Prius, and has sold over 100k units worldwide. The 2004 Prius is much improved, offering more room (midsize rather than compact class), but at the same time better acceleration AND better mpg. I think there is a short review in the current R&T and/or C&D.

Of course with the Prius, Toyota chose to emphasize fuel economy...using hybrid to downsize the gas engine to 1.5 liters.

With Lexus, we will see the same size gas engine as in the standard vehicles, so hybrid will be additive to performance (while offering a still impressive but lesser fuel economy improvement). As a sign of the performance angle, the RX hybrid as I understand will be called the RX400H (despite having the same 3.3L engine). Also as I've posted before, hybrid has been banned from Formula 1 competition, apparently because it would have given too big a performance advantage to those teams that incorporated it first.

Boo,
How can you compare an E55 to a stock Lexus sedan? That comparison doesn't make any sense. How much does an E55 cost anyway? I'm guessing it's somewhere near the price of a 911.

Anyone know if there are any modified GS cars out there? Lexus doesn't seem to have a dedicated Racing outfit like MB and BMW. But, for stock sedans they're pretty good in performance specs.

I seem to think the advantages of AWD are grossly overblown. I'm not saying this b/c Lexus doesn't offer it, but b/c of my 35+ yrs of driving experience. I've driven in the worst of weather with a variety of cars. I found the Range Rover (Back in the mid 70's) to be the best in harsh Scotland winters. In New England, I've had little trouble with my front wheel drive cars. The LS cars I've had needed snow tires, but drove fine otherwise. I didn't bother putting snow tires last year on my '92 and didn't get stuck anywhere.

For those who've driven AWD...Is there a perceptible difference in ride quality vs RWD?

bmwseller,

When I first saw you on this board I remembered Edmunds' agreement that prevents from saying anything about you as far as your motives go.

syswei,

In you post 3048 you stated:

""Not a judgement that runs something like ""gee, the Acura TL has had some transmission problems, and although I have no idea how widespread the problem is, it shows that the ENTIRE Acura brand might be just as unreliable as brand X"".""

Exactly! You don't know yet you assume the best. I can't wait until the 02' and 03' model Acura TL comes up in the 05' and 06' dependability survey.

""I have news for you. The 2004 E does not come with the 7 speed.""

The 2004 E500 does too come with the 7-speed transmission, the dealer here just got 3 of them today. Check the MB website if you don't believe it.

Thats funny you have to compare the acceleration of the LS430 to the SL500. Is Lexus really that bad off?

When and if Lexus' hybrids actually make V8 power and V6 gas mileage a reality, I'll be the first to congratulate them, until then however it's just wait and see.

Still reading through the posts. RE: #3153.

Do we have to go through this innovation and technology thing again? When are you going to realize that your list of what you think Lexus does so well aren't innovations? Do you not realize that Mercedes is responsible for your Lexus' ABS, crumple zones, stability control etc? You gave your list of things in reply to what boo20 said about technology. What in the world is technical about customer service, which you try to list twice as service and then customer service. Value? What does that have to do with technology? Thats good marketing. You're confused as to what innovations and technology are. Hybrid technology is just that, technology and innovation.

The adaptive headlights were on sale here FIRST by Lexus with their 04' RX330, but you do realize that certain 04' BMW and Mercedes models will also have these? We're not talking about the years lag like when Lexus finally gets something Mercedes has had for years, like Keyless Go. They're basically being introduced by all three brands for the same model year, if no the exact same month.

BTW, JDP can't tell you what every MB dealer has in stock. Only the larger-volume, more affluent area dealers are going to have SLs in stock.

boo20,

""Another reason people may be waiting for the '04 E class is because this is the first  year that MB is bringing back the legendary E 500. The '03s are only available with 3.2 and 4.3 L engines.""

You're letting them force you to spread yourself too thin. The 03' E-Class was available as a E500 model.

sv7887,

The car, like practically any other, requires an Oil change every 5000-7500 miles. Any decent mechanic will tell you frequent oil changes are probably one of the best things you can do for you car. Obviously, the Duration depends on how much you drive.

Right and Wrong. Wrong as far as Mercedes goes. The FSS (Flexible Service System) computes when a service is do, unlike Lexus which needs an oil change every 5000-7K miles, a Mercedes doesn't. Mercedes also specifies synthetic for all its cars no, so no they don't go back for service every 5-7K miles like any other other. You're right as duration dictates the service interval, of which a Lexus can't determine for itself. The Lexus way is low tech in this reguard. Did you know that a very much dissed American car brand has the technology to read it's own oil and determine the service interval?

""As for the Seven Speed Issue...Don't you think this is overkill? I don't see anyone else rushing to adopt a 7 Speed Transmission. Even a high performance car like a Corvette, Aston Martin
Vanquish, and Porsche 911 only have six speeds and can probably beat anything MB has to offer.""

At first I would honestly say YES. However if the new trans delivers on it's promise of better acceleration and fuel economy whats not to like? The Corvette doesn't compete with any Mercedes, so whats the point of bringing it up? The Aston Martin Vanqish gets beat by a the SL55 AMG, with it's 5-Speed, so image what will happen when AMG tweaks the 7speed for their cars. The 911 Turbo in automatic form I guess you could say competes with the SL55 or SL600, but they are vastly different types of cars. Yes the 911 TT is faster than either, but it should be considering it's 1000lbs weight advantage. The SL is a GT car, the 911 is a purebread sports car. When you want to compare the GT cars (you know actual competitors to the SL55) to each other, let me know and I'll show you where you can read about the awesome SL55 AMG and it's capabilites.

The real test of the new 7speed will be in the E500, S430, S500, SL500 and CL500, when they are tested by the automags and prospective buyers.

You're knocking Mercedes for going further because Lexus doesn't and isn't a leading innovator. It's the same old story, unless Lexus comes up with it, it doesn't matter. Mercedes is bringing a 7speed to the market for the same reason Lexus is bringing a 6sp to the market, better acceleration, fuel economy and just more all around flexibility, and lastly competition. Truth be told, a 5-speed trans is more than an ""enough"" in these cars, or are you telling me the current 5-speed in the LS430 is so lousy that a 6-speed was actually ""needed""? I know that wasn't the case. If Mercedes is bringing needless tech to the market then so is Lexus, and Lexus is doing it ""late"" as usual.

ljflx,

Now as always I look forward to your take on this issue, but there are a couple of things you've missed.

These surveys. I don't know what you think Mercedes' problems is specifically, but you seem to think that these are breakdowns by the side of the road. A lot of this ""survey"" hoopla is bs because when I see certain cars getting knocked for cupholders and stereo systems and fuel economy there is a problem. Fuel economy on a Hummer? Thats the most ridiculous expectation any Hummer buyer could have ever had. Cupholders on a Mini Cooper? Ditto. Now when it comes to Mercedes...........and before you say it....I'm not saying that this simple stuff is causing their downfall. From what I've read, seen, etc etc, it seems to be smaller electronic glitches, especially dealing with the Comand system. I've also seen things about ABC when it first came out, ditto for Airmatic. The problem is that you guys who think these surveys are king don't even know the criteria they (especially JDP) uses or what they feel is a ""problem"", because fuel economy in a Hummer surely isn't a ""problem"" in the basic sense of the word, it's more like a unaviodable trait of a 6000lb tru"
2932,"October 12, 2003 11:34PM",merc1,"There is something the Lexus faction will never grasp. People who really like cars (dare I say enthusiast) aren't going to want a car like a LS430 no matter how reliable it is because of it's design. It doesn't help that in the AutoWeek buyers guide they list the LS430 as being a JDP star. To some, not all..that says boring.

Now a few days ago you stated that the same dealer has 35 SL's in stock now they have 9? Come on now. I think you know you were mistaken on the first number. SLs like any other high-end car are sometimes ""flipped"" back to the dealer for more than the person paid for them. No, I'm not saying that this is the case with the 6 SLs you're saying (not sure if that is true) have come back to the dealer. This is something a Lexus buyer couldn't do until the SC430 came out. Unfortunately for Lexus that practice died quickly with the SC430.

Yes I see that Lexus has something similar to Mercedes' Pre-Safe system for 2004, and they also have an option similar to MB's Keyless Go for 04' also. It's about time since MB had Keyless entry since 01 and Pre-safe since last year. Lexus is always the come from behind, late as usual entry, that isn't always the MB's equal, like their so called pre-collision system. When are they going to do something first? They've cut it down to 1 and 3 years repectively, 300eguy05.

pablo_l,

I don't see how you can equate Mercedes and Chrysler's relationship as being the same as Toyotas and Lexus'. There are no gussied up Chryslers running around as Mercedes'. Chrysler is raiding Mercedes' old parts bin, not the other way around. The IS300 is just that, a Toyota....outside the U.S. The ES300 is much closer to the Camry than any Benz is a Chrysler. The GS, LS and SC do stand alone as they don't have Toyota cousin in THIS country.

_________________________________________________________________- - - ___

Waiting Lists. They vary by area and by model of car. Simply put there may be one (there is) here at Naperville for the SL55 or just introduced SL600. Yes they do have one used SL55 in stock, but there aren't any new ones. The CL55 or E55 are also in high demand here. They have a pretty good mix of 03 and 04 E-Class cars on the lot right now, some are tagged as ""sold"" some aren't. If there is a waiting list for the E-Class, its probably for the 4Matic models being offered for 04', there is good chance that dealers have people on a list for these as they are quite popular, especially in the Northeast and Midwest. There is a ""waiting list"" for the new CLK Cabriolets. I'll bet that no Lexus fan will find 6 of these sitting unsold on a MB dealers lot.

Overall it depends on the model and where it's being bought. There are no blanket rules for this nationwide after the first year a new Mercedes has been out. Right now the only MB I can see that would have a waiting list nationwide is the CLK Cabrio, and possibly the E55.

A ""waiting list"" is just the time between when a person orders a car and when its delivered. This is not anything new for Mercedes-Benz or any other luxury maker with a hot product. The difference is that Mercedes' rarer cars are limited in production, unlike certain Japanese makers who will ""ramp-up"" production to meet demand. That will satisfy the market, but it kills the brand image. Lexus doesn't have anything comparable to the AMG cars or the CL in general so there is a big difference here. How many Lexus fans are awaiting Lexus to come out with awd, of course there will be some sort of waiting list for the first year's worth of GS or LS cars when they get awd. So why is it so unbelievable that the E-Class 4Matic models don't have a waiting list? There also seems to be a theory that just because a dealer has a SL that was returned for some reason or have a stray SL55 in stock nobody else is waiting for their car to come it. Thats ridiculous at best. What does this have to do with people who have ordered a specific color and/or options and don't want the dealers leftovers and/or traded back cars? Nothing.

They are mass producers, MB every bit as much as Toyota. Check out the German MB site and tell us how the A class or cars such as the A class or the C180 contribute to the exclusivity of the brand.

Does MB have higher brand equity in the luxury sedan market? Yes.
Does Lexus have good brand equity in the luxury sedan market? Yes.
Does Toyota have the same - no. The argument is a fallacy. Toyota successfully createda different brand.

  I agree with everything you said. I do feel as if a 5 spd transmission is enough. I suppose Lexus doesn't have much choice but to update, lest they be left too far behind. They've stayed out of the Horsepower races, simply updating the cars enough to remain competitive but not win.

I think Lexus is making a smart corporate decision by letting someone else spend all the R/D $$$ and gamble whether the marketplace wants the feature. It's good business, but not good for matters of prestige. I've noticed Lexus seems to wait until certain options have matured in their product cycles.

As we've all stated, Reliability is Lexus' chief Marketing tool, so it's no surprise they lag in adopting cutting edge technology. I suppose they don't want to rush something to market and find that it brings down their reliability ratings.

At least they're being ""innovative"" with their adoption of Hybrid technology. This is a considerable leap forward in automotive technology. We'll how the Hybrid RX does (Mid 2004?) The Prius is a pretty good car, so my expectations are high.

As for me, with both 740 and LS400's in the family, I feel qualified to comment.

Simply put, the BMW is more rewarding to drive, the Lexus more rewarding to own. A few things about the BMW after 3 years and 57k. Why can't the Europeans get electronics right? Both the NAV display and the dot matrix driver info center on the BMW have been and still are on the blink. If you don't think that's a big deal, try driving 500 miles in a day looking at a display with missing letters/numbers in the display. Of course BMW says, ""Couldn't duplicate the condition"". The 18"" staggered wheels and performance tires look fantastic and ride well, but... cup very easily and get quite noisy as early as 9k miles. I've tried Continental, Michelin and Pirelli, all do the same. BMW's MacPherson strut front suspension is harder on tires than unequal A-arms on Mercedes and Lexus. BMW resale is also quite suspect. A 72k car, now 3 years old with 57k miles is worth 25k at trade. The 50k Lexus is worth the same.

The LS is simply the worlds best built Lincoln Town Car, with better shock and tires. Not at all rewarding to drive, but bulletproof and simply not an aggravating ownership experience. Everything works, always! Can't say that about the Bimmer.

My prediction: the Japanese brands will continue to gain, the Euorpean prestige brands will have to fight harder to defend their remaining market share. At this point, the Japanese brands' trendy offerings are gaining ground in Euopren at a very fast pace...

I was driven around Boston in a '03 Honda Accord today, and couldn't help but marvel at the fantastic price-performance-value that car delivers on. Really: S-class quiet and composed, C-class economy. I have to yet repeat on my Japanese ownership experience, but I do believe they're one to something..."

sv7887,

That is the most level post I think I've ever seen from you, and I really can't take issue with any of it. Lexus is smart, no doubt. Ferrari did the same thing back in the day when Porsche switched to rear and mid-engined cars....Ferrari waited until Porsche perfected the concept before adopting it. Somewhat similar to MBs and Lexus' relationship, both are great companies, but one just carries more weight with the enthusiast crowd.

Interesting question. Unfortunately, ""none of the above"" seem to apply right now. As a driving ""enthusiast"", I have yet to drive anything from the Japanese marques that impresses me. (Sedan-wise, since I'm not going to include the little Honda S2000 which I do hold in high regard compared to a nearly twice as expensive Boxster S). The Q45 clearly has the LS430 beat in this area, but it still isn't a 7 series, and nowhere near the AMG or Motorsport level. On the reliability front, I have been extremely pleased with the BMW 5-series (540i 6-speed and M5), but I know far too many friends and associates who have not had good experience recently with the E-class, S-class or 7-series.

merc1, boo20, pablo, et al.

You don't have to convince me of the value of heritage and automotive engineering excellence. Over the last 25 years, I've gone from an original BMW M1 to a 2002 M5 and in between had, amoung others, a 930 Turbo, 300SEL 6.3, and several other ""heritage"" cars.

That said, I am not willing to overlook the basic reliability factor, especially when it comes to an everyday driver like the E, S or 7. These are not AMG or M supercars. I hope your consistent cheerleading for Mercedes and against Lexus is not to suggest satisfaction with mediocraty in this area. It clearly needs to be improved, if not for the next quarterly report to Wall Street, for longer term strategic competitiveness.

I feel strongly about this. I took over controlling interest in a company several years ago at a time when most in the industry thought that we were ""doing all right"" in the area of customer satisfaction. After firing the senior managers who though we were ""doing all right"" and promoting those who had a desire to do better, we have gone from a market value of under $100 million to over $1 billion.

I, for one, sincerely hope that Mercedes in particular does not waste away its heritage with delivering less than acceptable levels of customer satisfaction. The notion that, because Mercedes has lowered it's relative price points, a $50k+ E-class is allowed to be less relaible than a $20k Honda Accord, is completely unacceptable to me. And I hope to every Mercedes enthusiast and Daimler Chrysler executive out there."
2949,"October 14, 2003 7:05AM",lenscap,"""All ""Lexuses"" are Toyotas in their own homeland, and in other countries.""

This statement is so misleading (and incorrect) that it warrants clarification.

First of all, Lexus models have been sold in Europe for several years now. In fact, the SC 430 had a waiting list for quite a while in England.

Second, and most important, Lexus models are not simply sold as Toyotas in Japan. Yes, they have ""Toyota"" spelled out on the trunk but that is a very misleading comment. You see, in Japan their culture is different than in the US. Toyota has such a powerful brand equity that Toyotas are not sold under different division names - it's not needed. It would be as if all GM cars were badged ""GM."" You would have a GM Cavalier on up to a GM STS.

Knowing that there are different price points, Toyota has grouped certain cars together and sells them in one of many sales channels. So, go into the ""upper"" showroom and you'll find cars like the Celsior (LS 430), Aristo (GS) and Soarer (SC 430) - cars that are every bit as expensive as their Lexus counterparts in the US. These cars were developed as premium cars and are not marked up in the US. Go into another channel and you'll find the RAV 4 and Celica. These cars do not share the same channels and showrooms because they cater to different markets.

All world markets are not the same. That is why Toyota needed to come up with a different brand name in the US, Europe and elsewhere. It's no different than Mercedes labeling its upper cars Maybach. Now that the Lexus name is established it will be incorporated into the upper sales channels in Japan. Lexus models here will be Lexus models there in just a few short years."

   NOT that a few doodads justify the HUGE price difference (though the Heritage does, to an extent). RadioShack-level Stereos/NAV, cheap cupholders, poor Manuals trannys, rough 4-cylinders, ugly hatchbacks definitely hurt the value quite a bit. With Benz it's six of one, half-dozen of the other.

That makes the M5 a sissy car. Yes, my tongue is a bit in my cheek, but this gender characterization of the RX330 by a guy who sells BMW cars for a living is a big laugh.

Trying to decide who is an enthusiast by the marque that they drive. That is a good one! So, I have noted that most of the S class Mercedes at my club are driven by men in my father's age bracket (70's to mid 80's) These are auto enthusiasts? Yeah right. Some of them have a hard time finding their car in the parking lot.

Certainly this board is filled by lots of auto enthusiasts. It seems that anybody who takes the time to participate here is very interested and enthusiastic about cars. So explain to me, why is the owner of a Lexus less of an enthusiast than a guy who has never owned any of these cars, but still bleeds Mercedes Benz blood? ...

  We all need to keep in mind how young Lexus is. 14 yrs is pretty young for a car company.
 For all those Auto Historians..How long did it take for MB to carve it's niche out in the industry?

From the beginning Lexus has played it safe. As a young upstart they simply took what the Best (MB) was doing and attempted to improve on it. If you remember their Marketing in 1989-90, you'll recognize the textbook job. Infiniti took a different route and got poor results. (Even though the Q was a fantastic cars.) Sometimes it's how you present things.

Lexus' prime Marketing tool is the Reliability coupled with Service and High end electronics. They definitely do follow MB's lead in deciding what options belong in cars. Given their young age, it's hard to blame them for that...BUT, I think we're going to see Lexus start to establish themselves as something other than a Benz imitator. Models such as the RX330 (Hybrid) and Future GS are indications of this.

Now that Toyota has really given Lexus their own identity, I hope it will translate into a distinctive Brand Identity. I'd love for them to embrace their initial designs of the LS and SC and apply them to the future designs. This upcoming Hybrid launch may indicate Lexus' niche will be in technology. Time will tell.

With the HPX concept, Lexus truly is branching out on its own identity. There is a real anxiety as to what the new GS will look like. That will truly be the beginning of the new-look Lexus.

2974,"October 14, 2003 7:52PM",tasillo,"I'm a little confused by the constant reference to Lexus ""copying"" Mercedes in their offerings. In my experience (again, having owned both), Lexus has not copied Mercedes (or BMW) in declining reliability, reduced customer satisfaction, poorer dealer experiences or accerated depreciation curves. Yes, the original LS400 looked a lot like the S-class, however Lexus failed to copy the Germans 50k + sticker.

The most interesting part of this debate for me is how Lexus and Infiniti have been able to methodically move their mainstream product up in price and content, while the Europeans have been forced to hold or in some cases reduce pricing despite obvious advances in their products. Witness a 2004 E500 vs. an early 90's E400 or 420.

The Germans engineer great cars. They've expanded their product offerings to touch most price points north of entry-level. They've become more accomodating to American requirements of options, colors and trim choices. But while the Japanese were smoking the world on reliability and owner satisfaction, the Germans seemed to be concentrating on playing catch-up with the electronics and ""features"", at the expense of their well earned reputation for engineering excellence. Not to confuse engineering with execution, but a well-engineered car still sucks when the NAV doesn't work, the reliability is less than stellar and the dealer is less than empathatic. I'm glad my BMW feels like it was carved from granite. But I'd also like the trip computer to work more often.

Finally, just because I respect the Japanese manufacturers, don't think I'm not an enthusiaist. I'm a motorsports junkie, have raced both motorcycles and showroom stock and generally love anything that consumes gasoline! I just also respect great quality, customer satisfaction and constant improvement. When Mercedes and BMW match Lexus and Infiniti in the reliability and durability classifications, we can settle this debate once and for all."
2975,"October 14, 2003 9:04PM",ljflx,"Great post - again. I know I said that to you once before on another post a while ago.

You also capture an essence that Merc1 misses badly, perhaps because he doesn't have a car in this grouping. That being that many of those who want to dismiss the reliability issues - which seem to be deepening for the Germans - comfort themselves by saying it is not related to the drivetrain or other mainstream automotive components. Wow. When and if the real automotive stuff starts to misfire it will be time for someone to turn the lights off for the last time and put up a ""for sale"" sign. When you pay this kind of money you want something as close to bulletproof as possible. Isn't that a true luxury that is a required component to match all the other great amenities of these fine cars. I think I'd be pretty pissed if I'm paying $86k or $1300 a month on a lease and my car is in the shop while my neighbor's kids' Honda Accord or Toyota Camry, at less than a third of that cost, works flawlessly all the time.

I've read a lot about pre-collisions systems here lately and other new technologies and who is innovating first. That is ridiculous because competition requires the others to follow suit. Does anyone really think that the others won't follow Lexus once the hybrid technology hits? That is normal (and natural) business and the last time I looked auto manufacturing was a business. Many of these innovations will be governed by mastery of electronics in your car. That means the more important question is which one of the manufactures do you have trust in when the need arises which hopefully, in the case of pre-collision systems, is never. Well I'll put my money (and trust) on the Lexus systems working best as they have demonstrated great mastery of electronics while the Germans still have a lot to prove in that arena."
2976,"October 14, 2003 9:35PM",fenn,"An everyday driving and ownership experience is the essence to most of us. The earlier comment about the importance of a car's reliability and a positive ownership experience is a really important issue to a car owner. The fantasy crowd, who has never dealt with these issues can lust for the car of their dreams, but owning and dealing with a car on a long term basis is a total experience. It is real life.

I must admit that I had a hard time giving up my Infiniti Q45 ownership experience. That experience was a pleasure. Bullet proof, no trouble, and a fresh free loaner waiting for me when ever I went in for service.

I love my new XJR, and have not had it long enough to comment on the ownership experience. If it proves to be a problem, I will not look back on it favorably, no matter how nice the car feels.

The people that I know who have jumped the Mercedes ship did not jump because they disliked their cars. They jumped ship as a result of the issues related to the ownership experience. I imagine that owning a Lexus can be much less stressful.

A great performer is a nice thing, but it is not all about 0-60 times or slalom times with this class of luxury cars. Sure, I love to let my car loose on Mulholland Drive, or a open highway, but most of the time I am just stuck in traffic. Most folks who drive luxury marques want a balanced relationship with the car that they drive. They do not want frustration with the service and reliability. Or frustration with new-fangled complicated gadgets like BMW's I-drive.

By the way, I have no axe to grind. In fact, I have never owned a Lexus, and I admit that I have periodically lusted for a Mercedes or Beemer from time to time.

However, I think you will find far more former Mercedes owners driving Lexus' than you will Lexus owners switching to a Mercedes. It seems to be a matter of ownership satisfaction.

I'm sorry, but all of which you've stated I see an excuse for one reason:

""Yes, they have ""Toyota"" spelled out on the trunk but that is a very misleading comment.""

The cars are still branded as Toyotas, just like I stated. You're first few statements contradict the end of your post. If there is no need for an upper-class nameplate in Japan because of the culture, then why would the go through the trouble of introducing ""Lexus"" in Japan. Also, there is quite a difference between Maybach/Mercedes and Toyota/Lexus. The Maybach started out as purpose built car for seperate nameplate, it wasn't an existing Mercedes rebadged for the purpose of selling it somewhere else. Nor was Maybach thought up at a board meeting, it's a legendary nameplate in it's own right.

syswei,

Haven't we been over this before about ABC? I said Mercedes did it before Lexus, I didn't claim that particular innovation was done first only by Mercedes-Benz. One such innovation would be SBC.

ljflx,

What you're missing is that reliability is either a) not as all encompasing as you'd like to believe it is for everybody. Obviously it isn't becasue why would anyone continue to buy German cars. Or b) the reliability of these cars isn't as bad as the survey clutchers would like to believe it is. I don't know how many times this has to be stated. People place different weight on different things. For you it's reliability, stereos and nav systems. For others its styling, performance, and design. When you can find one instance of Mercedes' safety technology not working as advertised, let me know. FYI, Mercedes' fall in the surveys has nothing to do with any of their safety technology, which they were pioneering before Toyota even had a clue about automotive safety. Mercedes keeps track of nearly every severe accident involving their cars in Germany for the sole purpose of advancing safety in their cars, they've done this since the 1950's. Even the most unreliable brands (per the all important surveys) don't have much in the way of problems when it comes to safety equipment.

2984,"October 15, 2003 7:27AM",sv7887,"Hi All,

I think the branding issue is just part of the maturation process of Lexus. They were smart enough to realize that no one was going to shell out $50K+ in the US for a Toyota. We all can look at VW's Phaeton as an example of what not to do. (Incidentially I hear this car sells well in Europe)

Of course, when you pay that much $$$ for a car, there is a certain snob factor to it all. I'm surprised it took Toyota this long to give Lexus their own brand identity in Japan. It doesn't help the prestige argument when MB fans point to the fact that the LS is sold as the Toyota Celsior in Japan. As I've discussed in my last point, it's just part of the growing process.

Tasillo,
The MB crowd knocks Lexus for copying styling cues from MB models and stealing certain options. I'm assuming they want Lexus to have their own identity rather than borrow from others..I've always felt the first LS was the best..The next models got blander and blander. When I look at my LS430, I do see a strong resemblance to the old S class.

It's annoying. Lexus has shown us that they can build unique looking cars with the RX, old SC, and GS. However, the future of Lexus looks good with the HPX. That's once nice looking car..

As for stealing options from MB, it's just smart business. (Although bad for prestige discussions like this) The Japanese are known for mimicing others. They take apart someone else's invention and simply make it better. Sony did this with TV's and chased the American companies out of business.

To me, it really doesn't matter who invented it, but who makes the best product. But I suppose when the discussion involves high priced luxury cars, things aren't so clear cut.

2985,"October 15, 2003 7:45AM",syswei,"""To me, it really doesn't matter who invented it, but who makes the best product."" I agree with your sentiments, and lets keep in mind that what's best for one person isn't necessarily best for the next guy."
2986,"October 15, 2003 8:36AM",tasillo,"The interesting thing about Lexus styling is that the only vehicles that receive criticisim are their two flagships, the LX470 and the LS430. Both of these vehicles play to a pretty conservative audience and have been well received despite their bland appearance. The ES, RX, GS and certainly SC lines all have unique styling, regardless of whether you think they are pretty or not. I find the LX470 most disappointing in that there's no attempt to differentiate it from the Toyota Land Cruiser, an exceptional (and expensive) vehicle in it's own right. I agree, Lexus needs to be a little more adventursome with their styling, but avant garde hasn't exactly worked well for Infiniti with it's flagship, Q45.

Different strokes for different folks..."

Actually, the Phaeton is not doing well in Europe. I believe it is only selling around 1/3 of what they thought it would."
2988,"October 15, 2003 11:14AM",lenscap,"""If there is no need for an upper-class nameplate in Japan because of the culture, then why would the go through the trouble of introducing ""Lexus"" in Japan.""

With Lexus having succeeded in North America they are turning their attention to the global marketplace. In order to be a global brand it's best to have your products branded the same everywhere.

""The Maybach started out as purpose built car for seperate nameplate, it wasn't an existing Mercedes rebadged for the purpose of selling it somewhere else.""

Nearly all Lexus models have also been purposely built under the Lexus nameplate. The Celsior (LS), Aristo (GS), Windom (ES), Harrier (RX), etc. did not exist prior to the start of Lexus. They were not existing cars rebadged. Since the Lexus name was not used in Japan these cars were sold under a new premium channel, which also did not previously exist.

""Nor was Maybach thought up at a board meeting, it's a legendary nameplate in it's own right.""

What's wrong with creating a new brand? That's excellent marketing. In fact, the creation of Lexus was so successful that a Harvard Business Review case study was written about it. The best marketers in the world develop new brands all the time. Mercedes hasn't been around forever; at some point it had to be a new brand also."

Thanks lenscap for pointing out the obvious that Merc1 and the Lexus bashers fail to understand or even know. So, what's next to bash besides styling ? Which btw, is too subjective to make it a worthwhile discussion topic.

I own an LS and love it. Not a single problem since day 1 of purchase. I am looking to buy an LX470 anytime from now. Just looking for the right color and price point. I put my money where my mouth is ! Like DonnFen, I have more respect for owners than from wannabe's, who only hypothesize from the few times they have access to their nephew's, niece, or friend's Mercedes car. Add in a good writing skill and voila, you are a Mercedes officianado and auto enthusiast extraordinaire !

Guess many 50-ish business people driving their S-class Mercs around are buying it for the *performance* or for the *marque* name brand. Jury says: name appeal and snob appeal of the 100+ yr-old Mercedes BRAND. Performance cars are left to the Porsches and Lambo, and Ferraris, AMG's and M."
2990,"October 15, 2003 12:24PM",digital_b,the original lexus es was based on the camry and actually the lowest end es250 WAS a camry. the old boxy version before they created the early 90s sensational camry. even after that the es 300 was just a camry with a different nose and in fact one of the car mags which I cant remember the name of did a comparison between a loaded camry and an es 300 and asked the question was the es worth the extra 5000 dollars over the camry.

But it has been a success, so others must have a better appreciation of design than myself (see why I drive an LS ?). But, the HPX is a much sleeker looking concept, imo, than the FX is. Remember, it is a concept car, and the final release may have little to no resemblance to the concept. I guess we shall see by Summer 2005 what Lexus does with its new releases purported to be based on these new concepts."
2994,"October 15, 2003 1:24PM",lenscap,"1. ""the original lexus es was based on the camry and actually the lowest end es250 WAS a camry.""

The original ES 250 was based on the Camry, yes. But there was no ""low-end"" ES 250, and they were not the same car. The similarities, though, didn't matter because the ES 250 was only meant to be around two years until the ES 300 arrived.

2. ""even after that the es 300 was just a camry with a different nose""

Not true. The cars had far more differences. As an example the ES 300 from 1992-2001 had a unique pillarless hardtop structure which the Camry did not. Further, the only part shared by the two cars that a person could see, inside or out, was the windshield.
  
The Windom (ES 300) and Camry in Japan have always been different cars selling through different sales channels. And, the Windom did not exist prior to Lexus coming - again, it was not an existing car rebadged. You are confusing platform-sharing with being the same car - which the Camry and Windom/ES 300 are not. No different than other platform-sharing cars such as the Jaguar X-Type/Ford Mondeo, Cadillac STS/Olds Aurora, etc."

there is also seriously wrong with my S430. after getting into the garage in the morning to go to work, i find my COMMAND Nav-Tek CD out of the CD-slot! I don't know why. When I pull the car in the day before in the afternoon, it is still in, and no one goes into the car. but the next day, it is ejected, and most of the CD is sticking out. Also, the COMMAND switches into German, and if i leave the CD out, it says ACHTUNG! and other German words i don't understand (i studied German a long long time ago). i have to then manually switch the language back into ENglish and have to pop the CD into COMMAND. i am sending in my car to the dealership soon. has this happened to any of you?????

i know this has compeltely nothing to do with cars whatsoever, but do any of you Mac-fans (i'm not really one) know if a Powerbook G5 is comming out? I was going to buy a 17"" widescreen Powerbook for my son's birthday, but it only has a G4 processor, and wanted to wait for a G5. the guys at the applestore deny that there will be one comming out. could any of you help me???? i only have less than a week to decide...

3000,"October 15, 2003 6:54PM",ljflx,"Let me know what pricepoints you get on the LX470. I'm also buying or leasing at the end of the year or in January. If you are still shopping then I'll let you know prices I am getting as well. In the meantime check prices and lease deals at LexusUS.com to keep your dealer honest on prices he gives you. It's a great suv with an LS430 like ride if you can believe a truck that big can ride so gracefully. The TLC may look like it but it lacks the LX refinement.

By the way that site is being changed to fleetUS.com (I believe) and will also do deals on MB, BMW, Audi, Porsche and others in the very near future. So if you are shopping the other brands it is worth a check to keep your dealer honest.

Lenscap - great posts as always. So the Celsior is a Lexus afterall. Believe me, some people around here will still not accept that. One question though - did Toyota have the v-12 Crown prior to 1990 or was it also introduced at the time Lexus was born. That v-12 has always been the rumored upscale engine for the LS. But the hybrid technology may blow it away. As well I believe the sports car in the link you posted is that V-10 super car that they are coming out with supposedly in step with the next GS.

HPX - Super looking vehicle. I saw HPX and the Infiniti at the NY auto show and people were ga-ga over the HPX. It is far more sleek and lower to the ground than the Infiniti and much better looking.

Syswei - thanks for the links."
3001,"October 15, 2003 7:29PM",ljflx,"I had only looked at the front of the car on your link and didn't realize they give you an all around look.

3002,"October 15, 2003 8:22PM",pablo_l,"I don't get the platform sharing bashing at all. It results in better cars, not worse ones, because it allows manufacturers to truly invest money where it makes the most difference. The tuning process turns shared-platform cars into utterly different cars anyhow.

On the Bentley Conti, good luck, 'cause they're sold out well into '05 at this point. It seems to be the only one of the recently introduced supercars that is meeting/exceeding expectations. Awesome car, I saw it at the intro to the US market last year (or perhaps early this year? I forgot) in LA, and the interior is out of this world."

It was the brilliant move on the part of Toyota because nobody here would be paying LS430, GS, and SC prices for ""Toyotas"" in this country. They had no choice but to come up with a fictional name that they had to go to court to keep because it belonged to someone else.

The ES300 started life as a Camry, and the IS300 is just a Toyota with a ""L"" on it for the U.S. market. The first generation ES, the ES250 was a Camry with a different grille and nothing more. A teacher of mine had one and it was about the worse rebadge job I'd seen outside of GM. How in the world could anyone think that the first generation ES250 was truly a seperate car is beyond everything automotive. The GS, LS and SC may have been purpose built as higher end cars, but they are still marketed as Toyotas in Japan...they're not Lexuses. These cars are just badged as Lexuses for U.S. consumption, for in Japan they are just upmarket Toyotas. There is no ""Lexus"" nameplate in Japan, yet.

3005,"October 15, 2003 10:35PM",bluestar1,"OK, let's consider this scenario:

Toyota Corp, a huge conglomerate based out of Japan, decides to expand their base into the luxury market. Decide on their intended target segments, and make elaborate and very strategic plans on what the future will be for this new branding. Then go out and execute flawlessly. Trouble is Toyota's brand in Japan is very strong, and hence cannot be diluted. Toyota's brand in the biggest car market, the USA, is that of a stodgy but reliable means of transportation. Nothing fancy nor luxurious about Toyota. So how about a new brand name they can build upon leveraging Toyota's strengths - reliability and value; package this with great luxury amenities, solid build quality and an exceptional customer service organization ? All recipes for success if executed flawlessly. Lexus begins life in the US. Platforms are shared to contain cost and push the cars out quickly. The Camry is rebadged as the entry level ES250. But they build from scratch the LS, GS and SC. Upmarket these within Japan and Asia as Toyota cos that's what the public out there identify with as a strong brand. Later, Toyota adds in the LX as a rebadged LC with a few frills and nicer interior amenities and more cushy ride. The RX, IS and GX come merrily along later.

Now fast forward 15 years, and the home market has had plenty of time to adjust to Toyota's other brand - Lexus. And this baby has come of age and bested the best of the best at what they do best. The foundation for the future has been built from ground up. Now it is necessary to let this grown up loose to chart its own future.

If I were Merc and BMW I'd be real worried about a *free-er* Lexus from the clutches of Toyota. Lexus has a deep pocket, a worldwide brand awareness, excellent market share and still growing, and now its own INDEPENDENCE to embark on its own future. Look out !

Main Features of Concept Cars

FUGA
Proposing a new direction in luxury cars that are both sporty and roomy
- Fuga&#146;s styling achieves two elements of a sporty exterior and roomy interior without tolerating any compromises.
- The FR-L Platform (FM Package), which is also used on the new Skyline, delivers superb driving performance.
- Interior spaciousness surpasses all other sedans in this class. Fuga&#146;s tall overall height that provides ample headroom, and legroom is expanded for rear-seat occupants.
- The interior&#146;s overall tone is unified in Japanese imagery and a modern design.
- Human-machine interfaces (HMI) that are simpler and easier to understand and operate are located in the middle of the center console. Control switches mounted on the steering wheel reduce the driver&#146;s workload substantially while providing multifunctionality.

I am guessing that these ideas may appear in a 2006 Infiniti model."

speaking of mercedes, i had the opportunity to test-drive the 2004 S430 and S500 with the 7G-TRONIC transmission. all i can say is ""WOW."" this is something to be marveled at. at first, i thought ""well what could be the difference?"" but believe me, it was so smooth that in my opinion, it is superior to that of the Lexus LS430 transmission (which is already the smoothest one I have ever seen) one of the things that I loathe about my '02 S430 is the 5-speed automatic, which I find extremely jerky.

also new for 2004: it looks like Mercedes has replaced the a MERCEDES-BENZ product sticker on the lower right corner of the windshield with a new one, which looks much more modern (21st century), while retaining the ""y Daimler"" signature. a very small detail but I'm obsessed with the small details. ;-)

also, I saw the new Maybach ""50-something on the showroom. looks very impressive, and the price tag was over $350,000. i asked how many they've sold to date: 2.

something quite amusing that i feel i must add: after test-driving the S500, i sat in a new 2004 E500 wagon. but after asking where was the third-row seat in the back, she said: ""you know what? Mercedes forgot add the third row seat in the first 715 E-class wagons! when the people at the port opened the rear door, they couldn't find the rear seats!"" so there is no third row seat and instead, mercedes supplied a black plastic crate (seriously resembling those pre-school milk-carts). i don't know how you could sit in those things (they look SO uncomfortable and small; i asume that only one person can sit in it).

for some reason, I can only imagine Mercedes for doing something like this. i guess when the seats come in, the owners have to bring their new car back in to install them?

and finally, after thinking it over, I have decided to keep my '02 S430 until next year when the new 2005 S-Class comes out. i just signed up on the wait list. can't wait to come out, but unfortunately, it looks like the S430 won't come back..."
3029,"October 19, 2003 8:18PM",ksurg,"Thanks for the input. I would love to buy or lease a Mercedes, especially one of the upcoming 2005 models but I need something sooner. I've gone through an interesting evolution when it comes to cars. What I have concluded is that you can't make a car that is everything to everybody. That is to say in my experience you can't make a full size sedan that offers the excitement of an all out sportscar. No matter how fast an E55 AMG is it won't provide the thrill I get driving my 996 C4S. By the same token a Porsche Cayenne can't duplicate the utility, towing capacity and payload of my GMC Yukon XL. So the question is for the money what is the best full size luxury ""uber"" sedan? Before you answer the LS 430 realize that I am biased towards German auto's( nobody's perfect ). Also it doesn't need to out accelerate my porsche in a straight line."

Although, I am not sure about Ksurg's mention of the ""cheaper"" price issue, because the A8L with convenience package and wheel options will be in the $74,000 range, which puts it in the same range as an S430 or 7 series.

I was very close to buying an A8L before getting my new XJR. I really liked the A8L. As I mentioned a while back in this forum, I think it is one of the ultimate luxury cruisers. It is spacious, well built, and it oozes quality.

So, why did I not get an A8L..? Well, for me the A8L felt just a bit too large, and it was not quite as sporting and quick as the XJR. That is not a negative comment. For somebody that wants a big luxury/sport cruiser with a limousine-like accomodations, the A8L is my choice.

I have mentioned my feelings about the '04 XJR earlier, so I will not tout it again. Let it suffice to say that I find it a perfect balance between luxury and high performance at its price."

As for price it is cheaper...look at comparisons here on Edmunds and keep in mind the options it comes with as well as the fact that it has standard all wheel drive. Lastly, it does look big but it is within an inch in length of the 745iL and the S500( interestingly there is a 4"" discrepancy in width between published spec's and those here at Edmunds).

3035,"October 20, 2003 11:07AM",fenn,"I know what page you are on. I am talking about the new '04 version. It has been discussed here previously.

You need to read back through the older posts on this board to see some of the comments.

I found this a link to the Car and Driver review of the '04 A8L this past August, which said: ""It's a stiff ride for such a lavish luxury liner, but one that doesn't come with terrific body control. The A8 actually shivers side to side as the car clomps over broken pavement, a slightly more disconcerting feeling in a new $74,090 German autobahn inhaler than in, say, the 1953 Ford Mainline we recently drove across Mexico.""

I think that a few other Edmunds posters made the same comments in July after the car first came out. It may have been a problem with early production cars. I know that I did not find those ride issues to be present when I drove the A8L, but I thought that I would share the informantion anyway. (I was thinking that the car may ride rougher with the optional 19"" wheels that they had on the test car).

The only version of the new A8 that is being imported to the U.S is the A8L. This is the long wheelbase version.. I drove it after driving the XJR and BMW 745, and it did feel bigger to me. It is the ultimate large grand tourer. Drive the car and see what you think. If you often carry four or more in your car, you will appreciate the commodious back seat area too."

One person in my office has an A6 that, after a few months of ownership, lost all interior and exterior lights. She was about 75 miles from home and called Audi roadside assistance. They said since the car could be driven they would not send help, so she drove 75 miles in the dark just to get home.

Another person in my office also has had numerous electrical problems with her Audi. Too many to even list here, but it's been one thing after another. One odd item was the car just died once while she was driving it on a highway. The car was in for service for a week before the dealer discovered a problem with the temp sensor. The car thought it was 50 below outside and shut the car down. To make things worse, the dealer rented her a Chevy Cavalier from Enterprise because they offer no loaners.

You can also check out some guy in the A6 forum who had his A6 bought back because of the many problems.

Factor in the poor resale value and I could not imagine spending $70,000+ on a car no matter how nice it may be. A comparison article in a magazine does not give a true ownership experience."
3037,"October 20, 2003 2:19PM",ljflx,"I am one that found the Audi A8L ride rather harsh and uneven and it was on the standard tires. I test drove it a while back so DonnFenn may be right that it is an early production problem. I am quite familiar with the old A8L as well, having driven and ridden in it often. I never felt that its' ride approached the refinement of the S-class or LS430. What I found disappointing was the new car ride was even less refined than the prior model. But I found the handling on the new A8 to be excellent (better than before)and the interior was well crafted and definitely had high-end materials. I would rate the interior more in line with Lexus and Jaguar and above the MB S-class. It is unquestionably spacious and luxurious and a nice place to live in.

My old office had a lot of Audi buyers, particularly the A4 and A6 and people often had problems, some pretty serious including tranny related problems, with the cars. But many people were quite loyal to Audi and the main reasons were the sportier handling and the AWD offered in all models. This is the Northeast and there has been an awful lot of snow lately so AWD is highly valued. What is interesting is a few Audi owners had Toyota and Lexus suv's in their garages and in the big rain and snowstorms they showed up with them and left the car at home for their spouse.

DonnFenn - I spotted a Q45 driving around a local strip mall the other day. It was in a dark burgundy color and I did a double take on it as the car seemed perfectly made for that color. Then the guy pulled right along side me and for the first time I realized that the Q's engine is as quiet as an LS430. I asked the guy how he liked it and he said he loved it."

There won't be a ""S430"" or ""S500"" either, there will be all new direct-injection engines of different displacements. Now Mercedes might ignore the actual engine's displacement and badge the upper V8 S as a ""500"" model because of the equity in that designation.

lenscap,

Ahh...what you're describing is the difference between reliability and build quality. Audi does make the best interiors of the German makes, and arguably the industry. Their cars are heavy, solid and generally very robust in their construction, but their ""guts"" just don't hold up as well as a BMW or Mercedes. The old A8 and current A6 4.2 basically use the same drivetrain and they are notorious for dropping transmissions. I've seen these range anywhere from 5-14K replace! It should be interesting to see the new A8's showing in this area since Audi switched to a totally new ZF 6-speed auto for the 2004 model. This is the same trans that Jaguar (XK,XJ,S-Type), BMW (5, 6 and 7-Series), VW (Touareg) and Rolls-Royce (Phantom) use.

Audi A8's ride quality is hampered by the couple of hundred extra pounds sitting over the front tires.

My guess would be that Audi tuned the A8's suspension for sportiness and the nervous ride is just a result of this, especially with the 19' wheels. Being awd has nothing to do with it. Wasn't Car and Driver's car suffering from a computer glitch concerning the suspension? Others like Motor Trend and Automobile haven't found fault with it's ride.

b4z,
 Keep in mind the majority of those repairs come well after 100K miles. I did have the rear shocks replaced on my 92 LS b/c I was getting annoyed with the soft ride. Cost: $325 at the Lexus dealer. The shocks themselves were only $65 each. Even the LCD displays are only $400 at the dealer. I pretty much agree with everything you said, just wanted to highlight that those costs are even lower based on my own experience.

I think b4z said 3-400, as in Hundred. You're not going to win the reliability debate. A Lexus trumps anything in long term reliablilty costs. It's how Lexus sell cars while BMW probably uses Sportiness to sell theirs.

I'm not saying BMW is a poorly built car, but in the Long Run a LS car will be better in that regard.

Merc,
In your opinion, what is Build Quality vs Reliablity? Are they mutually exclusive?

SV"
3046,"October 21, 2003 9:29PM",ksurg,OK guys I tried to do my homework. It is very curious that Car and Driver was the only mag to seriously criticize the A8L. I did an extensive literature search to see if there were any trends in regard to ride quality or other issues. Though many commented on the weight of the A8L and some visual obscuration from the rear headrests the reviews were glowing. As for refinement I find driving a LS430 equivalent to 10mg of ambien and the S500 like watching a rerun documentary. I suspect some of you believe if you can feel the road the ride is not refined. I enjoy driving and don't want to feel like I'm sitting in a sofa in my living room. So I wouldn't presume that isolated is synonymous with refined. In the end it is a matter of taste but for those of us who drive aggressively the LS430 and S500 are neither more refined nor appealing.
3047,"October 21, 2003 9:52PM",merc1,"""In your opinion, what is Build Quality vs Reliablity? Are they mutually exclusive?""

The short answer is no they aren't mutually exclusive. Lexus blends them very well, on the whole probably better than anyone else. I'm just guessing here, but I think you knew this, but wanted me to admit that? Anyway...with Audi they are exclusive traits. When you open the door of a A8, A6 or A4 you feel the heft, when you sit down your senses are delighted by the sheer quality of the interior plastics, wood, chrome, aluminum and the way it all all assembled. The A4 Cabriolet is stunning this reguard, try one out. The convertible top and it's folding structure are overbuilt. Look at the trunk hinges on the upcoming VW Phaeton, overbuilt and really not necessary, but they scream quality.

You'd think an Audi would be very reliable too, considering the last forever ""feel"" of their cars. Audi has more problem than either Mercedes or BMW, and gulp(!) admittedly more serious ones at that (trans, engine etc). So really the answer to the question depends on the brand being discussed.

Mercedes for example used to be the standard in build before they starting cutting cost. Mercedes' problem is that when they used to insist on overbuilding their cars they really didn't have much competition, yet when they decided to downgrade their interior fittings, the Japanese appeared and BMW, Audi, and all the rest got much better at it. The funny thing is that Audi and Mercedes use the same (French) supplier for the S-Class and the A8, but Audi pays for higher specification, thus VW's thinner profit margins. Mercedes specifies thicker gauge steel and sheet metal (Volvo does too) for safety purposes, magnesium seat frames and so on..all costing...while not really noticeable by the average buyers, unless you get into an accident.....while using lesser grade materials for things that didn't relate to safety. This is most easily seen in the 1999 S-Class compared to the 2000 S-Class.

The British and German press continue to insist that Mercedes is going old-school with build quality, and focusing more heavily on reliability with the next S-Class, but for a price. There was a tear down study done about a year ago comparing newer Mercedes' with older ones. Surprisingly they found that the newer cars structure/chassis was just as robust as the older cars, but the decontenting mainly came in the areas of interior panel thickness, plastics for just about everything and seat frames. Interesting indeed. All car companies decontent in some way or another, but they do it differently. Toyota does it where you can't see it and where the average car buyer is not likely to care. Or in other words where its not likely to show up.

These things can be very expensive. Cost on the Jag - just for the transmission before labor - $9,500. Ouch.

In my own test driving experience the A8L felt like a great luxury sedan. It was a really ""nice ride""-- but it was not particularly fast, sporty, or lithe. Despite Car and Driver, I did not have any complaints about the ride, but I found it almost sedate until pushed it hard in the ""dynamic"" suspension mode.

I am not an active member of the Lexus fan club, but I imagine that the new '04 Lexus LS 430 is actually quicker in acceleration, and may even equal or exceed the A8L in handling, with the optional handling package.

During my own recent car shopping experience, I also drove the MB S500 (your ""rerun documentary"")and found that it's powertrain and acceleration was pretty spunky compared to the A8L. So in my book, as nice as it is, the Audi is just as much of a sedate luxury cruiser as the Lexus or Mercedes.

Don't know about Lexus, but i think Hondas have thinner sheetmetal.

I believe GM was the first of the domestics to go with thinner sheetmetal.
In '77 with the redesigned/downsized Impala/LeSabre/Bonneville/Fleetwood,etc.

Yep, the Japanese have traditionally used thinner sheetmetal.

The system employs what is called ""active steering"" to keep drivers from having to countersteer to correct a potential spin when the wheels lose their grip.

It works by employing steer-by-wire software that automatically sends steering input to the wheels to make sure the car stays on course. Instead of waiting for the car to get out of control, it begins to modulate steering when traction loss is detected...it corrects the skid before the driver notices traction loss which makes countersteering unneccesary."

So I want to trade up from an A6 4.2. For those who wonder why anyone would want to go from 0 to 60 in 5 seconds with the kids in the back seat realize that the kids are only in the back seat maybe 20% of the time. The problem is they're big kids. What do you guys think. And does anyone know if there will be a 2004 RS-6?"
3068,"October 30, 2003 10:33PM",ljflx,"I'm going to have to eat my words after reading through Car and Drivers $70k sedan review this evening.

The LS430 was at the top of the heap with 184 points and the S430 was at the bottom with 163 points, trailing even the Phaeton. The Jag XJ8 in second place with 182 points helps to provide clear interpretation that the reviewers favored ride as a driving force in this one. All the normal words about fun to drive factors were in there as usual but this time the reviewers favored the type of things I look for in a lux sedan over those things. This does not - in any way - mean I change my viewpoint on the autorags nor do I agree that an LS430 is 21 points higher than an S430. It just illustrates that the reviewers will favor what they seek in a car just like buyers on this board will. If the car provides it than that is the car that is best for the person or that gets the highest rating in the comparos. There really is no ""generic"" best as far as I am concerned in this group when each car plays to a different strength or set of strengths.

With all that said - I did get to ride in and drive my buddy's 2004 euro LS last weekend - one that he had picked up a few days before. The car is virtually the same as my 2001 inside - except that he was able to show off his blue tooth technology and satellite radio (which is awesome) but the ride and handling is better than ever. It's amazing to me that as good as any of these cars are when you buy or lease them that the auto mfrs. continue to improve them noticably within a few years. I couldn't imagine a car riding better than my 2001 LS but the 2004 with a sport suspension rides noticably better and even quieter than my 2001."
3069,"October 30, 2003 10:47PM",merc1,"Officially there will be no ""2004"" RS6 models, but the 2003 models are being built until the end of the year last time I asked about one. I test drove an A4 a little while ago and the dealer had a RS6 on the floor for only ""90K"", you know the usual markup games. I think if you want an RS6 go for it, just drive sensibly when little ones are riding along. This the most awesome Audi to ever be sold here and the only one built by Quattro GmBh. Next up...a RS4, most likely with the same engine as the RS6!

ljflx,

Nice way of saying I told you so. I'm not surprised here due to fact that all those cars are newer and more powerful and Car and Driver's rating systems has changed to something similar to a Road and Track format. This cuts out some of the personal preference stuff that used to go into their tests. What all cars were in the test, and what was their final placement? Where did the 7-Series finish (if it was there)?

Speaking of the Phaeton, the V8 it was announced will start at 64K and change. The W12 between 80-84K for the first few launch edition models. What did Car and Driver say about the big V-dub?

But underneath the gross ratings it is easy to see how preferences come in to play and why scores could easily be different if those preferences were weighted differently. For example - fun to drive - 745I -9, LS, A8L and Phaeton - 7, S430 - 8. In powertrain performance the S430 scored a 7 but in chassis performance it scored a 10 (the only one to do so). In fit and finish and features/amenities (two things that drive me) only the LS scored a 10. Ride (which is also sky high with me) was an interesting one. The LS and XJ scored a 9 (though the article in verbage states that the Lexus ride is unmatched in this group). Here the 7 scored only a 6 probably due to the preference on handling.

Anyway - this is not at all an I told you so. It just shows the different strengths of the cars and that the audience of fans and buyers will always side with the car that provides what they want the best. The ""my car is better than yours"" and ""this car doesn't even belong in the group"" stuff is ridiculous."

It seems very clear now that the LS will be completely redesigned in the summer of 2005. Another article from Automotive News says that Toyota wants to revamp the entire Lexus lineup when Lexus is launched in Japan in August 2005 with L-Finesse-designed cars that have no visual links to Toyotas. Any further push into Europe will be delayed until the Japan launch of the new cars.

In an interesting twist of irony, Lexus does not want to sell any North American Lexuses as rebadged Lexuses in Japan (that's why the current Lexuses were not on display at the Tokyo Auto Show, only the two L-Finesse cars). In other words, the RX 330 will not all of a sudden become a Lexus in Japan in 2005. Again, they say they want a whole new lineup designed from scratch.

My guess is the RX, ES, LX, etc. will stay as North American Lexuses only until they're redesigned. At that time they'll get the L-Finesse treatment and be sold in North America, Japan and Europe. I wonder if that means names like Celsior, Aristo, etc. would be dropped when the new L-Finesse replacements come. We'll have to wait and see."
3078,"October 31, 2003 12:23PM",ljflx,The LS400 was developed as a Lexus here and as the Celsior in Japan and simply packaged as a Toyota instead of a Lexus there. If it weren't for the development of Lexus in 1990 Toyota would probably have never brought the Celsior to market in Japan in the first place. So I don't understand their logic on this one. Nevertheless - I'm sure they have done their market research so I'm not going to question it. I'm very curious as to what that next gen LS will look like.
3079,"October 31, 2003 12:50PM",fenn,"I read these tests and try to use this information, but I get a kick of how these tests and testers come ups with such a wide range of opinions.

For example I see that Car and Driver had the LS430 and XJ8 tied for best ride.. Contrast this with Consumer Reports (not a true auto authority) stating that the XJ8 ride was quite inferior.. and the LS430's superlative. The same two cars.. with different interpretations. Oh well.

The fact is that all of these luxury cars are pretty damn good. Each has its own appeal, whether it is ride, performance, status or amenities...

By the way I think that the Audi RS6 is a very cool car. It is a very hot performance vehicle. However, it is a high priced performance sedan rather than a luxury car. In my mind, it appeals to folks that might be M5 fans, rather than those that are looking at luxury sedans."
3080,"October 31, 2003 1:02PM",ljflx,"The S430 was optioned out to $87k with a sport suspension - which is crazy - because anyone in their right mind would take an S500 at that price level. The 2004 was unavailable so they used a 2003. Perhaps the 7 speed will help but they complained about lack of power and having driven the S430 in 2001 I know what they mean. They should have used a less equipped $85k S500.

An interesting sidebar is the complaint against the lawyers on the nav screens and against iDrive in particular. Many of us on the board said it was overkill and needless before the new 7 even arrived. The techies at BMW got far too carried away with making the simple tasks so difficult. But C&D condemns it and thinks it will make the resale values on the 7 series take a beating. I think they are 100% right on that one."
3081,"October 31, 2003 8:34PM",merc1,"Well you know I might register a small complaint with not using current cars, that really isn't a fair comparision to use different model year cars when the newer model has some valid improvements. I'm curious to see what the next mag will say. However you are correct...they should have used a S500, even I would rather have the S500. I'm sure the S430 got killed in the value equation too optioned out that way. The unfortunate part about comparisions is that each maker has a test fleet and whatever is in the fleet at the time of the magazines request is used so they don't always get the right car, or a correctly optioned one.

As far as resale goes, the 7 has always lagged. That said, none of these cars are going to be a picnic to own once they age, they all have a certain level or electrical complication that will be very expensive to maintain years and miles down the road.

As has been stated by many others, VW does NOT have the pizzazz, history, heritage and clout to retail $60K+ cars in the US car market. How many people will look to buy a $64K V8 or $80K V12 Phaeton ? At that price level, there are significantly better more name-recognized cars than a VW. I own an LS and would never consider a VW at a luxury car price range. Even a nicely optioned 2004 LS can be purchased for less than that. Now tell me if anyone believes a VW is in the same class as a Lexus ! And if VW's can be priced that high, whatever happened to Audi, their supposed luxury line ?

Meaning: VW's Phaeton, while a nice car, will not succeed in the US market."

3084,"November 1, 2003 10:22AM",ljflx,"At $69k (the estimated price C&D put on the car, which they thought might be low) the Phaeton is not worth it. Plus it is a very heavy car. I'd buy an A8L long before I'd ever consider a Phaeton. They aren't going to cut it here in my opinion and I still am missing VW's whole strategy. The US market is not big enough at this scale. You already have two exceptional softer riding cars in the S and LS and buyers are fiercely loyal to both. Then you have the more sport handlers in the 7 and the A8L (though it doesn't seem Audi is in BMW's league on performance in the big sedan from what I have read). Then of course you have Infinit and Cadillac waiting to pounce as well with far better buyer confidence and acceptance than VW. Plus they have whole lines of cars whereas the Phaeton is an oddball in VW's lineup. I hope their strategy isn't to be have a softer contra-Audi car at each level. They will get crushed.

If they want to have a chance they have to make the type of direct strike Lexus made in 1990 and then roll out more models right away. But if they do that then you have to wonder why Audi is here. I just don't get it."

Just sold a 2002 Lexus 470. She has a BMW 330 conv. and Im buying a new 'touring' car. So the top 3 were Lexus LS430, BMW 745, Benz S430/500.

We love the exterior of the BMW and its ride, we even blindfolded ourselves to overlook the awful rear end design they came up with. It was the I-Drive, however, that was impossible to swallow. Out of the question, especially if you have ever used the systems in a Lexus. As I said, she is a tech-phobe but she took my last Lexus on a 45 minute drive and had it all figured out without lifting the manual. So I took a drive to Lexus and took a look at the LS430. I was astonished at the superb job they have done in everything, (styling still a little stodgy but a lot better than it was). AND, for 15k LESS than the
BMW. So I was about to write a check to a dealer, and my wife begged me to look at the Benz first. When I saw the S 430/500, I was immediately (and very) emotionally hooked. What a GREAT style with that rake on the front end. It is, imo, the best looking car on the market at any price. However, once I got into looking at the reliability, and in particular the nav/communcations/environmental systems, the Lexus beat it in every single area. (They tie in comfort, the Benz a little stiffer for a sportier ride) I learned my lesson from my BMW what it is like to try and navigate yourself around in the European designed nav, twirling dials and pushing it every few seconds, even for a simple task like changing form FM to AM. And, Benz is traditionally, a couple of generations behind Lexus in tehcnology. E.G., how about Bluetooth technology for Lexus. Outstanding! Anyway, we've decided to go with the Lexus, and then realized we were also saving about 20k in the process (from the Lexus price I was able to locate). I can throw a heck of a party for that much money. Last week I got the current issue of Consumer Reports...they happened to be comparing these three cars (and Audi).

My problem now is that I drove a RS-6. Now consider that I'm coming from a C4S as my daily driver. Though not as nimble as the Porsche, the RS-6 truly offers hair raising acceleration and handling. Though the E55 AMG is faster in a straight line,in real life driving( i.e. aggressive driving) I think the RS-6 has the advantage. As for the venerable M5...it's close and I suspect the new V-10 version may outperform. Now for the bad news. The RS-6 starts out with a premium( approx. 10K fully loaded) and has a surprisingly low residual at 3 an 4 years. What does this mean? It means it is unbelievably expensive to lease. If another sales person tells me how much more it will be worth at the end of the lease than estimated I'll scream. So my choice is to buy or pass. If I buy it will be in December, a ""great"" time to buy an '03 model. No RS-6's are planned for '04. If this is the case I am willing to pay invoice and not MRSP. Does anyone disagree?

3089,"November 1, 2003 10:32PM",jamiem4,"Thanks for the info - we'll have to go to Lexus! We walked out of the Mercedes dealership today (after going back and forth all week with this decision). We test drove a S500 they shipped in for us and compared to the 2001 750iL the S500 didn't feel like much of a car (not as impressive to drive). We really dislike the new BMW body design and of course that nightmare i-drive, so we thought either the S55 or S500 was the next step (the S600 seems overpriced..). For 90k (sports package) it just wasn't worth it - like you say - for 20K we can have a great party instead! Much to the frustration of the dealer (we were very clear we weren't going to buy anything until we drove it) we told them ""maybe next year!"" - they still called us 3x today at home hoping to close a deal. After reading your message we'll keep the BMW and look at a Lexus. We have one of the last 750s shipped into the US and is just a great riding car.
Another question - is the Lexus easier on the gas? Between a 2003 Rover and the 750 we need to buy our own gas station it seems. The kids cars even drink gas but not like ours!

I think your sales person claiming it will be worth significantly more than the residual at the end of the lease should be immediately jailed for fraud. Everyone I know that has spent over $45k for an Audi of any kind has taken a complete bath at trade in time. There is just no demand for a used high performance Audi compared to an AMG or M car (or Porsche).

If I were you - and I am not, since I strongly prefer a manual transmission - I would go for a new E55 over the RS-6. The new E55 is a significant advancement over the previous version, not just in horsepower, but in handling. It's still not as crisp and fun to drive as my 6-speed M5, but it's likely to be a much better investment than an $80k+ Audi come resale or trade-in time.

3092,"November 2, 2003 9:24AM",ljflx,"Excellent review of the Phantom on the front page of the auto section of today's NY Times. If you read it you'll enjoy it. I didn't realize that this car has 31"" tires. Wow. But those tires let a lot of road noise penetrate the cabin, which is surprising. But other than that the ride is supposed to be great. One nice touch that I hadn't noticed before is that the rear seats are raised so that the rear passenger has the same view of the road as the driver. Smart.

A sidebar to the story asked different enthusiasts if they would prefer the Phantom or the Maybach. The preference was for the Rolls. But a banking exec gave the reason as the ""revolutionary design combining sportiness with maturity"" which - per him - fit today's banker. Interestingly enough the review contradicted him as it made it clear that the Maybach is the sportier car. A funny sidebar was asking a valet at the Peninsula hotel in Beverly Hills which one he would park in front. His answer was neither. Reason - He takes care of the guest not the car. So I guess a guy in a Honda Accord who tips bigger gets the preferred parking spot.

The reviewer's conclusion was the Maybach was the better car but the Rolls was the bigger statement of success.

The more I see of the Maybach the more I realize that it is - from an outside design standpoint - too much of an extended S-class. It should have been designed more as its own car. The Rolls is indeed a striking car - particularly from the side - and has very much its own DNA, at least in styling."

The difference then must be even greater than the 500. However, even at my age I am learning lessons. The LX470 I just sold was rated 12 city and 16 highway and that is exactly what it would do. One day, however, I got up on the wrong side of bed and decided pump prices were too high, so on my 200 mile drive to a golf course home near Yosemite, rather than my normal 70-80, I made it a point to not exceed 55 mph, just to see what would happen to the mpg. (yep that put me in the long line of 18-wheelers). At the end of the trip there, it showed 19.9 mpg!! So at least I felt better knowing I had options available to me. :-) BTW, I heartily the persons advice about getting what you feel best with. That issue is what nearly made me go with the MBZ, the cool styling. But it was just 'nearly'. Our plan is to keep an eye on things...in 2-3 years either Lexus is going to match MBZ sporty styling, or MBZ is going to catch up with Lexus reliability and technology. It will be a quick process to just make a change to the winner at that time. BTW #2, if Lexus uncorks it styling problems, MBZ may inherit a monster of a problem keeping its current market share."

I find it funny that anyone owning a Lexus would knock VW for not having the heritage and clout, as I thought that school of thought was that those things don't matter. VW is simply doing the same thing as Toyota did back in 1990, but they're doing it with their own brand. VW at least is a true original brand, unlike Lexus which was thought up during a Toyota board meeting in 1987. That said, I don't think it will work either. The car itself looks to be ok, if not segment busting. VW's real problem is at the dealership level and reliability.

michael_mattox,

You're missing the point. Point being, is that expensive cars like these are going to cost as they age, when something electrical fails. Yes, the reliablity of a Lexus is well harped upon, but if you think that none of them ever have a problem once they age, you're not dealing in reality. Have you not seen the posts on these boards concerning the replacement of gauge clusters and nav systems on older Lexuses? The bottom line is that none of these cars are for the 2nd or 3rd owner short of cash.

ljflx,

Yes its a confusing and as much as I love VW/Audi products, a risky strategy. VW is said to want have a model in each segment of the market. Their (not mine) logic is that people don't shop/compare Audis with VWs. Not completely true, but the degree is arguable. Yes, the Phaeton is overweight, the European press has complained about this for over a year. I see reliability and the total dealership experience (sales, service etc) being the biggest problems for the car.

The Phantom rides on metric-sys/run-flats so yes they do work out to be the largest passenger car tires on any car in the U.S. I've said all along the biggest issue with the Maybach was it's exterior and it's overally closness to a Mercedes S-Class, inside and out. Bad news is the current bodystyle is going to be around for a while (7-years).

3095,"November 2, 2003 11:58PM",bluestar1,"As luck will have it, our Sunday local newspaper had a review of three luxury cars - VW's Phaeton, Aston Martin's DB9, Lexus' LS430. Here are excerpts:

VW Phaeton: (reviewer - Ralph Kisiel)

On its introduction to the US market....

""Instead, VW officials here and in the US often find themselves defending their decision with dealers and the news media to build a premium sedan with a VW badge""

on European sales....

""Through July VW had sold 2,574 Phaetons. The automaker had expected annual global volume to be as high as 15,000 units""

on the success of this car....

According to Frank Maguire, VW's VP of Sales and Marketing, America, states: ""The challenge is not the product .... it will stand up to anything out there. The challenge is: Will people buy a luxury Volkswagen?""

Touche..

Lexus LS430: (reviewer Jerry Garrett)

""Pluses: Pleasant rumble of V8, luxurious feel, to-die-for stereo, retained value, quality.

Minuses: Very few, if the price of admission to the club doesn't scare you""

Aston Martin's DB9: (reviewer Jerry Garrett)

The article was titled: ""Aston Martin crafts planet's coolest car""

""The DB9 is such a quantum leap from the DB7 that the company skipped right over the option to name it the DB8""

""It is powered by a new tweaked version of the 6.0-liter V-12, offering 450 horsepower and 420 foot-pounds of torque..... The run-up from zero to 60 mph should only take 4.7 seconds with the manual....""

All of this for $150K (coupe, 6HP26), a bargain considering the old DB7 retailed for $235K.

All in all, pretty good reviews. There was also a line-up reviews of future releases from Merc, Audi, Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin, Bentley, Ferrari, Jaguar, Lamborghini, Land Rover, Maserati, Maybach, Mini, Porsche, Volvo, RR, Saab and VW.

Merc's going to have even more variants in its lineup, such as CL65, SL65, and CLK55, and the stunningly beuatiful SLR. That car is gorgeous, but at sticker price north of $400K, I suppose it gotta be, lol ! I dunno if Lexus will add variations to their line-up anytime soon. They sure need more trims to make it more interesting..."
3096,"November 3, 2003 12:19AM",merc1,"Sounds yummy. I have to say Aston-Martin is making some of the worlds best looking, yet distinctive cars of the modern day. The Vanquish, while I'm not in the up in the air about it anymore, remains a gorgeous car. I'm amazed and yet put off by the fact I've never seen it in any other color than that drab silver/grey. I mean even in music videos it's the same dull color. Haven't seen on the road either so it's kinda fading away with me. The DB9 has the same look, but more finely detailed from what I can see in the pics. However where the real improvement has been made is in the interior, the DB9 is stunning and appears to be of much higher quality than the DB7 and more importantly the Vanquish. I was so shocked to feel how hollow the steering wheel is on the Vanquish at this years Detroit show.

The reviewer made some mistakes though. The DB7 never stickered for 237K, thats Vanquish territory. The DB7 is a 160-170K car at best.

Add Maserati to that list of stylish makers too. The Audi dealer here also owns and Maser dealership and they had a Sypder parked among the Audis today. Man what a car, so stylish and tailored! Only 97K! It had all kinds of custom options and leather wrapped this and painted that, right down to red brake calipers and interior-color-cordinated leather-wrapped roll bars. Its the kind of car that says the hell with surveys and such. Can't wait to see the Quattroporte.

I think they would if VW had a reputation in place for better reliability and dealer service. Even the reliability thing hasn't slowed down the Euro brands that don't top the JDP surveys, but their dealerships are in much better shape than VWs.

Mercedes-Benz is going thick on the top end. Between the CL, SL and S-Class cars and all their AMG variants and the SLR, they'll have 10 cars with about 500hp or more! Madness. One of the things I like about Mercedes is their depth of product of which no other brand has. They compete with Bentley (Continental GT), Aston-Martin (DB9), Porsche (911), with either the SL or CL and yet they compete with all the ""regular"" brands below. A full service brand. This is what VW wants to do, but I must say I think Audi would do better on their high-end.

3101,"November 3, 2003 3:48PM",tasillo,"I too just got may latest C&D, amazed to see the S430 finish dead last and the Jag and Lexus at top. Agreed the S430 was way overpriced at 89k, however at that price it's still a better deal than a 70k VW! I saw a Phaeton on Michigan Ave in Chicago Sunday AM. Had to double take to make sure it wasn't a Passat. For the VW, it boils down to the ownership experience and dealer service, neither of which VW excels at. How do you think a Phaeton owner is going to feel when he/she brings a 70k machine in and drives out in a loaner Jetta? Or worse, an Enterprise beater? Beth very likely as I can't see VW dealers making the investment in a large fleet of even Passat's. I owned a GTI VR6 a few years ago, great car but the dealers in Atlanta were a nightmare. Make an appointment for an oil change and leave the car for the day. No thanks!

I love to drive and 75% of the ownership equation is how the car performs, drives and handles. However, it's not a museum piece, I need it to function (well) every day, not cost a fortune to maintain, have dealers that actually care about repeat clientele and be worth something 3-4 years and 80k miles later. From my experience, that pretty much eliminates the VW, Audi and Jaguar from my consideration, although Jag's definitely seem to be rising in reliability and resale.

Regarding merc1's comments about Lexus being a ""created"" name, exactly! It may not have meant anything day one in the USA, but it didn't have any baggage associated with it either. The VW name however, recalls everything from the ""Peoples Car"" mantra of the early Bug, through the ""ugly is Pretty"" campaigns of the mid-60's. Add in the baby boomer experiences with the engineering masterpieces like the 1st and 2nd generation Rabbit, the Dasher, and the other assorted VW misfits before the took a serious approach to the US market and you end up with a lot of folks who are skeptical of VW moving upmarket from economical family transportation with a Euro bent. From the inventories of Touraeg's on the Atlanta dealers lots, I'd say they're not blowing out the door either. BMW's probably done the best job of moving their brand image upmarket. In the early '70's, a 2002 could be had for 3K. Even the first 5 series car in the late 70's was well under 10k. BMW created that image on the performance reputation their product always had, adding luxury and room onto the rep as they're product line grew. Never did they stray from performance as the main selling feature of their product, however.

Good luck to VW and their dealers in moving Phaeton's, from the way they were discounting w8 Passats however, I wouldn't be surprised to see Phaeton's advertised at 10k off sticker in the near future."

For cars that have such an impact with the public they are produced and bought in very low numbers.

YTD thru September 2003 vs. 2002

MB S-Class:
YTD 2003 15,981
YTD 2002 14,534

Even with all the complaining about MB quality, sales are up.

BMW 7 Series

BMW has a problem on their hands. New model ands sales are DOWN.

Lexus LS

YTD 2002 19,909

Lexus updated the LS just in time. '03 sales were way down. No '04s are in these numbers.

To put things in perspective, the E-class sold 15k more in the first 9 months than last year's 2002 model.
Electrical gremlins have not hurt sales of that car at all.

The local newspaper reviews I quoted earlier also noted the slowed LS sales for the 2003 model year, and suggested that as the reason Toyota/Lexus had to make such vast improvement to the '04 model. The review was titled: ""Wake-up call"". To drive the point home, the reviewer quoted an Acura exec's response on ""... why so much high-end content was been made standard on a new model"". The reply: ""To keep the brand alive""

My opinion on Merc's electrical gremlins not having any noticeable effect on sales is that since the first 4 years of service are covered by Mercedes, new buyers don't have to worry that much. Only those buying 3+ yr old CPO's have to worry about the car's reliability concerns.

Sales. I'm not sure why certain publications make so much out of a sales decline of a car (LS430) that was introduced back in 2001. The S-Class had a similar slide in 2002 before the facelifted 03' model came out. It happens to every car over it's production cycle. Intro=hot sales, few years production = sales drop, refresh = sales gain, then new model and cycle repeats. This in no way means the end of Lexus, Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar, Audi or anyone else. The only time this would spell trouble is if the car in question is new and flops, like the Q45 or M45, then you have a true ""situation"" on your hands. That combined with no new product would spell the end of a luxury brand, but that isn't even the case with Infiniti. A new Q and M are on the way it seems.

I will say the Europeans are a little better with keeping the variants coming over time to keep a model interesting. Seeing as how Mercedes now sells a lot of 4Matic S-Classes and VW twins have awd, I expect the next LS and even XJ to offer awd.

Acura's situation is somewhat different as they don't truly have a flagship car. The new TL makes the RL obsolete, to put it mildly.
They've adjusted to not selling many RLs.

3112,"November 4, 2003 6:38AM",syswei,"I agree with Merc1 here. There is a natural cycle for sales volumes for any given model, unless the manufacturer purposely limits supply. Rather than look at how individual models are doing year to year, it is better to look at whether the overall brand is gaining or losing share within its segment (i.e., luxury or mainstream segment), since the overall brand will have models at varying parts of their lifecycles."

3114,"November 4, 2003 6:59AM",tasillo,"I agree with the above posts that it's customary for models to decline in sales as they age and are no longer the ""hot"" new thing. The reference to Impala and Tahoe sales being stronger in 2003 than in '00/'01 is diluted because of the ridiculous incentives being offered to move the iron. When a manufacturer is offering rebates and incentives than enable you to buy a vehicle for 20-30% off of the sticker, they're really cannibalizing the value of the earlier models. A loaded 2000 Tahoe LT 4wd would have had a sticker of about 42k, if you were a good negotiator, you'd have bought the truck for about 37k. When you can buy a '03 with a sticker of 44k for 34-35k, that further impacts the resale value of the previous model years. It also reduces the residual values of lease vehicles, resulting in higher monthly cost.

I'm very glad that most high end marques have avoided the incentive game, especially the factory to consumer type. That and the limited supply (no fleet sales to Hertz, Avis) accounts for the considerably better resale values of not only the high-end cars, but also the mainstream products like the Honda Accord that avoid propping up their sales figures."
3115,"November 4, 2003 9:45AM",b4z,"Gm's ridiculous incentives are reflective in their MSRP's.
Did you guys know that GM had 20 price increases last year!!!!
Did you know that the Impala's MSRP has gone up over $1000 every year.

While the Lexus LS's has gone up about $500.

Yes GM has been offfering 3-4K incentives but my 25.5K 2001 Impala LS now costs almost 29K!!!
Hardly a bargain.
You would have been hard pressed to get a 2000 Tahoe for much off of MSRP.
Now 7-8K off is not uncommon.

Luckily the high end market has avoided this by offering value and superior build quality."

Despite some complaints, the car has clearly been a success sales-wise, as it is now selling in volume comparable to the s-class and LS."
3118,"November 4, 2003 1:48PM",ljflx,"Yeah - I knew it was for racing but it is beautiful.

sales - you know I went into my Lexus dealer in early September and there wasn't an LS in sight save for older ones that were being sold as certified cars. They had sold out their LS allotment and were waiting on the 2004's for which they had a lot of advanced orders. So here is a big volume guy with no cars to sell for nearly a month. The reason was supposedly the factory had cut over to the new model and had stopped production on the 2003's. So the natural result is lower sales. It also seems the entire market is down slightly and this is the result of the economy. So I also don't put much stock in the sales figures for 2003 ytd. Lexus goal for the LS has always been 20-25k in sales with the higher figure in the initial year or two of production. They happened to hit north of 30k in the 2001 model year which surprised them but they had only sold around 14k cars in the 2000 model year - the last year of the LS400. Likewise the E is having great sales because of its new model year. That plus the fact that the last model year has a naturally lower production count as the factory switches over, leads always to a larger percentage gain just based on units produced. In addition the gain is overstated as buyers hold off on the old and wait for the new."

By the way - just my 2 cents - but $88k for that car at this point in time is a rip off. The dealer may have done you a big favor.

For the board - I don't want to go back there but all those cars that our friend Boo20 said were impossible to get and required as much as a 6-18 month wait were on the list in multiples. But this time they had 2004 in front of them. Again - the list was a 10% representation of all cars available."

My husband likes a good engine for around 100K in a new car and to him the 2001 is no longer new. I'm just curious why we had that reaction from the dealership. It reminded me of when (over 20yrs ago) I bought my first Honda and the salespeople did that thing with writing down a price on a piece of paper with that vertical line. Then the $$ man would walk over to close the deal. Haven't we progressed passed that? Well, we are in NC! It was fun actually - but a bit of a throwback to the 80's.

Amusingly when the closer came over, he used a small calculator and after putting several numbers in, wrote down what he thought was a correct offer.. After thinking about it far a few seconds and being close to exhaustion, I accepted, signed my name , he had already signed his, and then I mentally added the numbers up and there was a three hundred dollar error(to my favor) He then actually beggeg for me to split the difference with him, after we had already shook hands and everything..

3132,"November 4, 2003 10:32PM",merc1,"Sales trends - I agree completely. It's a up and down thing. If you look at it the S-Class should dive this year, with a new A8, Phaeton and XJ, plus the revised LS, and the still somewhat new 7-Series on hand. Mercedes' marketing maching is so well-oiled though and they gave the S a new trans and 4Matic to keep things fresh until that faithful day in 2005 when it all starts over again.

I finally got to read that C&D comparo. The S430 they used must have had ABC also, another pricey, seldom-ordered S430 option. I say this because on the spec page they list all the others, except the 745i and S430 as having air springs. They list hydraulic springs for the S430, it must have been a ABC equipped car. No wonder the car cleaned up in the chassis deptartment, but had a eye-popping price. I still don't see how the Phaeton beat the S430 though with all the little niggles they complained about. A similarly priced S500 Sport I think would at least beat the Phaeton and A8. Reading this test underlines where the editors were in terms of preference this time around, ride comfort and features. The three of the four German cars that had athletic handling (S430,745i,A8) and provided more ""fun"" in their driving experience didn't dominate this time around. Interesting. There has never been a Jaguar XJ in any other place than last before now. What a triumph for Jaguar. Another note of interest, the complaints about the Phaeton and A8's body shake and quivering over bumps. VW has stated that Phaeton is easily the world's most solid and rigid car. I wonder what happened?

When Toyota came up with the Lexus brand in 1989, they at least had their rock solid reputation for quality and reliablity to back up their new launch. But what does VW have to back-up their luxury car branding ?? Nothing. That's why I suggested VW execs must be smokin' something. IMO, the VW Phaeton ain't going anywhere but the dust.

Doesn't make any sense. Product wasn't Lexus' strong point either in 1990, the LS was their only true luxury car. The ES250 surely wasn't. The T-reg and the Phaeton doesn't make a luxury brand correct, but it does help people get over the shock a big bucks VW.

But I do wish Mercedes would improve the interior along the lines of the A8. The Audi, the Jag and the Lexus have stunning interiors. I actually think the 7 has the worst interior. It's just to much of a business club. I haven't driven the Jag and I must say after reading the story I am curious to do so.

I'm also at a loss as to how the S430 scored so low. To me the embodiment of the S-class is always the S500 so I also think they used the weong car.

ljflx,

Let me be the first to say that I agree that Toyota is a leader in hyrbid-tech, no argument from me there. However you're knowledge of diesels seems to be of the past. They aren't anywhere near the noisy cars of the past, as most Americans have this perception. BMW, Audi, Mercedes, and other Euro makers have refined the diesel concept to the point of being nearly the same experience as gasoline car. A car like a S400 or 740d are quite remarkable. And yes before anyone from camp Lexus says it, DCX has struck a deal with Toyota also. I too will be impressed if the RX330 Hybrid works without a glitch. It does have the makings to change things dramatically. Though just like diesels I see a limited following for each. The first Prius was not without problems.

bluestar1,

You're killing me with this notion that just because the Europeans aren't first at this that somehow they've made an oversight and don't know what they're doing? Come on now thats a little bit much. They're working on hybrid tech and have been for years, just not the same kind as Toyota. Not that Toyota isn't ahead at the moment, not arguing that, but to say that the Europeans are clueless about any sort of hybrid tech is simply ridiculous.

Well that conversation was lacking on substance to say the least and was just too ridiculous for me.

The Lexus L was very clearly evident on the SC430 and the caption on the picture made it clear that it was a Lexus dealership as well. But this dealership was in Tokyo.

Even MB only sells sround 1200 or so S600's a year in the US. Dealers don't want these cars laying around so they are nearly a custom car thus the very low production.

It is truly a rocket ship with a comfortable ride. What's scary is what happens when you push the car on twisties...basicly it's overpowered.

3170,"November 7, 2003 12:51PM",tasillo,"bmwwife

The 760 interior would have to be a pretty incredible change from the 745 interior to justify the extra cash! As a 740 owner, I find the new 7 series interior to be about as unattractive as any high-end automobile interior I've ever seen! The differing shapes, textures and colors combines with the i-drive and absurd seat controls to make it unacceptable to me. Don't get me wrong, I think the new 7 series is hands down the best driving of the large luxo sedans. However, in their quest to be different and cutting edge, BMW crossed over into Avant Garde and technocratic. I love the gadgets and features all these cars offer, but it ought to look good and function well at the same time. Disappointingly, I found the new 5 series to be only marginally better, thanks to the console shifter. An X5 4.4 is my only hope if I'm to stay in the BMW family (which I would like to).

Interestingly, the new A8 interior offers all the technology the BMW does (including the mouse-type controller) but manages to look more expensive than the car is. Great ambience, texture and sense of warmth to it. I have a feeling the new A8 won't fair any better resale wise than the old one, in 2005 an A8 with decent miles may be available in the high $30's. That would be a heckuva car for the money!

Hi. We are the fools who actually considered a S500 vs. BMW and were willing to give up one of the last 750il's delivered in the US (we ordered it from Germany) for a Mercedes. After driving the S500 it was pretty clear that we'll stick to BMW. Today the BMW dealership let us drive a 745 around - b/c we've hesitated to 'deal with' the i-drive. The 745 definately out-does the Mercedes. The interior is modern (we didn't/couldn't 'deal with' the i-drive but didn't have to: a lot is just voice activated...) and fun. The S500/S600 seem cramped with cheezy plastic (not anchored) controls and the rearview mirror wasn't correctly snapped together (yea - $90K). While the new 7-series body style forces you to 'never look back' the smooth drive makes up for the panic attack you experience when you think you loaded groceries in the trunk of another car.
 We're not your average critics (or car fans.) My husband test drove jets at speeds we can't hear at and I designed rocket fuel(s)/engines (in 'my day'). I(we) still have to agree with BMWwife that for a sedan, BMW makes the smoothest machine in this (up to about 135k??) category although that i-drive and redesign caused us to momentarily beam over to the Mercedes dealership...."

The fact is that many cars are going towards aluminum. Many of the body components, like hoods, on several makes of cars are going to aluminum.

In the case of the XJ they started with a fresh slate and created a new platform and assembly system.

The weight of the new XJ makes it lighter, quicker, and it offers much better gas mileage than most other cars of its size.

Yes, I may have a vested interest as an owner of a new XJR...but my real life average fuel economy after 4500 miles is now about 17.5.......Show me another car with a V8 putting out anything close to 390 hp that offers this type of economy.

The repair cost issue is a concern. My jury is still out on this one..... However, I am told that the modular nature of the car's skin and chassis will make repairs easy, and not out of line. This remains to be seen. However, I think that they have so much invested in this new car that they will make parts and body panels affordable, or the insurance ratings will suffer and impact the XJ's viability.

unfortunately, not the same to my friends house (Jason). he lost absolutely everything, including his beloved, recently-fully-restored Mini Cooper from '67, i believe. saw pictures of the car, and his now burnt lot. it is really emotional to see.

well, my a highly special object that my parents lost during the fire was their cherished '85 Mercedes 500SL. beautiful, in perfect condition.
i have determined to replace their MB with a new SL500.

some close buddies have decided to pitch in a purchase a new 2004 Mini Cooper for him. Red in color, just like his old one.

in the meantime, i have given him my S430 to him temporarily, and he seems to like it (he has an E430 sport).

well, on the brighter side, our S430 is doing fine, although it seems to have a brain of it's own: the seat mysteriously adjusts itself by it self; when I leave in the day before, and come in the next day in the morning in the garage; either the headrest is fully up or the seat is all the way to the front. i don't understand this because i thought that the seat's don't have power if the ignition is out, and no one enters the garage at night...

the SL is doing quite fine, my neighbors still envious (one of them is considering the new BMW 645ci).

i've also seen quite a few new Jag's on the street in La Jolla. it is trully a classy car, but frankly, it's not ""my style"" ( i am attached to the looks of the BMW 745Li, the half sporty/half classy lines of the S-Class, and i have to admit, the sharp design of the new Audi A8L. the jaguar is simply to ""old-world-elegance"" for me!

Sorry, for not 'getting it' but isn't this 500 hp thing like having a 1/2 acre swimming pool or 50,000 square foot home?

Looks good on paper, fun to talk about and show off to the oglers, but rather useless.

It would seem to me that real luxury is much more along the line that MB's 4matic step has taken: a luxury car for all conditions. Great everyday road handling with an engine/transmission and occupancy that are well-suited to it's needs and intended usage.

Also, the high hp, MB ""Mustang"" pony cars like the E55 or S55 can't begin to 'compete dynamically' with cars actually designed to use high horsepower, like a Porsche. I feel they are dangerous. (IMHO).

Nobody I know likes to ride around as a passenger in a sedan with 500 hp while the ageing driver shows off his testosterone reservoir, lack of respect for the environment and scares the youknowhat out of everyone when the vehicle reaches the driver's limits long before it reaches its. (Thanks to the alphabet soup of vehicle save-me technologies, this doesn't cause as many crashes as it used to!)"
3184,"November 10, 2003 6:50AM",merc1,"As always footie, I have to ask whats the point of all that?

An AMG Benz is no more dangerous than a RS6, XJR, M5, Viper, Corvette, Porsche or Ferrari in the hands of someone that doesn't know what they're doing. To suggest so is ridiculous at best. Any car with 500hp represents a certain amount of danger to a novice. Heck a Mustang GT (a mere 200+ hp) is dangerous in the hands of the just-got-their-license 16 year old.

3185,"November 10, 2003 7:02AM",syswei,"I second that, personally I'd rather see Lexus add AWD to the LS than add another 200hp to a sedan that already does 0-60 in 5.9sec.

Some might want to pay an extra $20k-$50k or whatever for extra cylinders (beyond 8) and hp (beyond 300 or so) in a sedan, but they are few and far between, as evidenced by the BMW 760 vs 745 sales data."
3186,"November 10, 2003 7:44AM",merc1,"I have to say that with that mindset Lexus is destined to forever produce yawns from anyone wanting some excitement. Would it really be that terrible if Lexus produced a next generation GS to compete with all AMG, M, R and RS sedans of the world? Gee whiz, live a little guys.

M"
3187,"November 10, 2003 7:55AM",syswei,"Lexus probably should produce something to compete with the AMG/M types. It would enhance the brand image, certainly. But does it matter to that many people? The M3 (including the convertible) accounts for just 7% of 3-series sales, while the M5 accounts for 4% of 5-series sales.

I'm just saying there are other things that would be more widely appreciated, such as AWD or maybe pre-collision (yes, copying MB)."
3188,"November 10, 2003 8:19AM",michael_mattox,"To me a Luxury car is peace and quiet, comfort, and the ability to handle any conditions safely (I agree with you about 4 wheel drive)

3189,"November 10, 2003 9:38AM",merc1,"You know what, I agree with all that, but Lexus already has those things (and they do it quite well), minus the awd. I just think it's time for Lexus to liven things up a bit, everyone else has something exciting somewhere in their lineup. What kills me with you guys is that suddenly because I suggested that something more exciting be added, there is this notion that everyone should have a 500hp AMG/M type car. Never said that.

Talk about a brand that appeals to a many due to its depth of product, thats Mercedes. In fact Mercedes has the widest range of products in the luxury market so I'm fully aware of needing to have awd and other practical things, but MB (and others) also understand that these products need to be balanced out by offering something for that discerning few. It doesn't hurt the brand, it only builds it.

M"
3190,"November 10, 2003 9:43AM",syswei,"I agree that MB has an impressively wide/deep product line, and that Lexus should move in that direction. I think they have made comments suggesting that they will, but it would be tough to come remotely close to the number of variants MB has, at least in the near term."
3191,"November 10, 2003 10:24AM",michael_mattox,"When the product line is broadened with low production image machines it increases the cost of the primary products.

Look at how well Lexus has held it's new car price and maintained it's quality leadership....I think they have the better profit and growth model.

A few models done VERY WELL works....Yes, there are some who would like to see a Lexus uber car, others like myself would like a big LS430 convertable, some would be happy with 10 or 12 or 16 cylinders .....It is very expensive to produce these cars that sell in such small volume."
3192,"November 10, 2003 12:19PM",lenscap,"Thanks for the reply. I wasn't questioning the use of aluminum in the Jaguar, just the way they are marketing the car. I feel since the aluminum is such a huge part of the car they should play it up in more ways than just lighter/faster.

As for repairs on the Jaguar, I just read an article on this. Jaguar has 28 structural repair shops to repair the XJ. These are either run by Jaguar dealers or are independent shops. The initial investment is about $100,000 since these shops need special tools like computer-controlled welders, riveting guns and an isolated repair bay (needed because if steel particles come into contact with aluminum it can corrode). This compares to 11 repair shops for the Audi A8, which require an initial investment of $250,000 to become certified due to mandates by Audi.

Jaguar has 169 non-structural body shops that require only a $5,000 investment by the shop.

Because there is a big dollar investment in aluminum car development, only high end cars will be all or nearly all aluminum. This is because the high cost cannot be gained back in cheaper cars. As a result, the next Audi A6 and Jaguar S-Type will not be made of aluminum."
3193,"November 10, 2003 1:24PM",oac3,"syswei and mmattox. Merc1 is right that Lexus needs to liven things up a bit. I believe we all do agree somewhat. What we seem to disagree is to go the route of Mercedes or BMW and do the hp-war stuff.

Toyota/Lexus has never been into that, and they probably won't, at least in the short-term. Rather, as michael_mattox eloquently puts it, doing a few things well is far more profitable than doing a lotta things poorly. Witness the declining quality of Mercedes. Do you think spreading themselves too thin may be a culprit here ? Way too many variants to satisfy every conceivable market space. Among a bevy of C-classes are low production C32 and C43's; ditto S-classes in very low productions - S55, SL500, SL600's; what about the coupes - CL55, CL65, CLK55, CLK65, or the E-class - E55. How many muscle cars does the market need ? Spreading one's resources this thinly makes for a huge risk in cost-containment, quality control, reliability, and the small things that seem to fall apart quickly. Profit margin at DCX has taken a huge hit, and without much cash, it is difficult to sustain these large variants much less future growth."
3194,"November 10, 2003 5:23PM",miroslav1,"Hi all,

I ride a Honda CB100 and have never owned a car in my life, so I really need some help. My wife wants a nice big Sedan, and I don't want to spend more then $20,000. Should I get an early 1990s MB S class or BMW 7 series, or a more recent Lexus, Infiniti?

Are there any particular years when the MB S class was really fine, like wine? Or the Lexus Es? Any models or years to stay away from?

I'm really starting from scratch here, so I'd appreciate all reasonable advice. Thanks in advance.

Miroslav"
3195,"November 10, 2003 6:06PM",fenn,"Opinions are like ""you know whats"" ...and you are bound to get a wide range of ideas around here.

Are you sure that you want to ask us? There are a few folks that will tell you any MB is the best bet. Of course, there are others who will tell you that the reliability of a Lexus is the way to go. Then, somebody will tell you that the ultimate driving machine is a BMW. etc, etc.

For starters, you need to decide whether there is a characteristic or look that you want in your car...Or, is there a ride, comfort, and convenience issue that makes you happy. OR, are you wanting reliable, low maintenance operation?

You need to decide what is the most important thing to you, but you also need to shop hard and look at a bunch of cars if you are buying used.

I am not even going to offer a strong opinion because there will be ten other viewpoints that disagree. However, my general thoughts, based on budget and practicality are that a used car under 20k may be a best bet with a Lexus or an Infiniti.

For best used value with high content you can take a look at Infiniti. The Q45's have had poor resale as new cars, but they are a good buy if you are picking up a used one cheap.

Good luck......."
3196,"November 10, 2003 8:57PM",ljflx,"I'll second everything that DonnFenn said and ask you what are you looking for in terms of ride. Do you want a sport handling car or a softer luxury ride? Do you want a more recent model say a mid 90's sedan or one that is 10 years old? In the latter grouping all the cars will be around the same price point assuming they have similar high miles on them. Lexus and Infiniti (don't rule out the Acura Legend or RL either) will offer you the best chance for a more reliable car but there are no guarantees that you will get a trouble free car and repair bills are not cheap in this league. If you go the real high end route I would stay away from anything with an air suspension. Since the Infiniti Q doesn't hold its value well anyone who buys a pre-owned one is getting a great car at a low price and can buy a later year model. The Q45 has poor resale value because of its lack of popularity and not because it lacks abilility or luxury. It's a lot of car for the money and an excellent car if you seeking the best bang for the buck. For what its worth I had a family member and friend buy out two cars at the end of my lease terms. The first was a 93 Acura Legend and the second was a 95 LS400. Both cars are still around today and both have surpassed the 200k mark in miles. Lastly I'd get my hands on the Consumer Reports buyers guide. The 2004 edition just came out and it has a large section that tells you what the problem cars have been and what areas of each car have been problem prone over the years. It will also point out what model years are better than others within the same brand.

Merc1 - Agree completely with you on your Lexus comment re sporting things up. Regardless of low volume car comments made earlier, if you really want to play in the rareified air long-term than putting out AMG's and M-class models as well as V-10's/12's is a cost of doing business. If they lose money it becomes an extension of a marketing expense and if they make money then all the better. I think Lexus will enter that space after 2005 as they redo their body styles."
3197,"November 10, 2003 10:40PM",merc1,"Your second paragraph of post #3475 raises some interesting points. Yes Mercedes has more models than ever before, but that isn't the main reason for their quality decline, cost cutting is. Some of which may or may not be linked to having to absorb losses at Chrysler. This sheer depth of models means there is always something new to try, so a many a MB buyer (not all) will stay with MB until they sort out their issues. This has been witnessed right here on this very board. A LS430 or SC430 buyer doesn't have any other choice after that but to get another LS or SC, which I'm sure is fine for many, not saying it isn't...just trying to make the point about product...not desirability.

Toyota's Lexus on the other hand has been very conservative with their lineup when it comes to additions. They only new segment they've entered is the sport sedan segment with the IS300, and it hasn't been a success. Lexus' best products are the LS, ES, their SUVs and the SC430. The difference between Lexus and Mercedes is that Lexus' sales dominance is based on somewhere around 50 percent of those sales being based on SUVs. Mercedes' sales aren't dependent on any one model as they all are top sellers in their respective segments. If Mercedes is spread too thin, Lexus is just the opposite....no variety. I wouldn't want to be that dependent on one particular segment (SUV) of the market.

Mercedes is only doing what they've always done, many versions of the same car. BMW and Audi do the same thing, they just don't have as many models (like the CLK, CL, SL) to do it with. You should see all the C, E and S-Class variants that we don't get here. Euro makers have always done this, it's nothing new. For years Mercedes' most loyal customers asked for more variants, and just looking the sales numbers it was justified. Look for BMW (6-Series, X3, 1-Series, possible X7) to do the same thing in just about a year or so.

"" How many muscle cars does the market need ?""

None. It's not about ""need"" its about want, lust, desire, but definitely not need. Everyone has a tuner product nowadays, its all the rage, similar to the SUV thing. Even Volvo has a 300hp S60R, with an adjustable suspension that has one mode only suitable for the track. This is from Volvo!

3201,"November 11, 2003 10:54AM",ljflx,"I also agree. But remember that Lexus has said, quite often, they don't intend to be all things to all people. MB tries very hard to do that, thus you have cars as low as $26k starting points these days and an A-class model which will be lower still. Part of the reason for that is clearly due to the way the European market evolved over time as merc1 stated. Secondly merc1 is talking from the enthusiasts standpoint and he's 100% right from that view. But last week Toyota announced record profits of $5bln in a six month period during a period where the Yen strengthened. An exceptionally strong performance to say the least given the currency rates worked against them. So they obviously have done things very well. They will spice things up but it will be a mild flavor. Right now its obvious from the Tokyo show their next big startegy is hybrids, sportier designs and AWD on most models. They'll play to the hard core enthusiasts a bit but they are clearly looking to blow the cover off the ball with their hybrid technology."

It's inevitable that perception will catch up to reality at some point and it is probably starting to happen.

By the way I respect and greatly admire the incredible depth of MB vehicles available. Having so many variants of cars is no easy task and is the mark of a great company. It is also a reason why MB prices are higher than everyone else as the less syndicated products you have the higher your unit cost overall is to manufacture. So that cost gets averaged in to all cars produced and the person shopping your basic MB pays more for both the product diversity and the brand image.

From a CORPORATE standpoint, since, as ljflx pointed out, they (Toyota) are the most profitable company, it appears that the current strategy works just fine, and that maybe MB should be emulating Toyota/Lexus rather than the other way around.

From a pure PRESTIGE standpoint, Lexus should offer more models and variants, of course; but imho it is not clear from the evidence that this would benefit corporate profitability even in the very long term.

From a PERSONAL standpoint, it just depends on what one wants. Personally, I don't see myself in a SL65-equivalent, but would consider a Lexus wagon, if such existed, to potentially replace the LX my wife drives."
3208,"November 11, 2003 8:40PM",ljflx,"They need to do a few things:

1. AWD availability on most or all models. But don't force it the way Audi did - that was a big mistake in my opinion.
2. build the HPX ASAP
3. Allow for tuned versions of the LS,GS,SC and IS. Get the new GS out soon as the old model is far too dated. They need a volume seller between the ES and LS.
4. bring out the Hybrids with the added power and improved mileage
5. allow a better mixing of option components. Currently the packages are too syndicated.
6. Put a greater distance between Lexus and Toyota and clean-up the duality of the LX and TLC
7. I also like what MB does in offering a slew of additional colors at an extra $1k but I'm getting petty now.

The most important thing they need to do though is maintain the great build quality and reliability of the cars they have today. The quality of the Lexus name is so high. I had a guy trying to sell me a high-end and very costly copier last year and he swore the machine would run like a Lexus.

Lexus already is charting a new course starting 2005. The LF-S and LF-X concept vehicles are winners, imo. The new GS cannot come any sooner, and it better be good. I hope the rumor that it diverges from the LF-S isn't true. AWD is certainly needed on the GS and LS as options (we west-coasters don't have that much need for AWD).

For 2005 GS, I'd like to see a REAL BMW killer: 6-speed tranny, 18"" wheels, L-tuned suspension (Euro or whatever Lexus chooses to call it), V8 hybrid engine delivering 350+bhp, ML, 4th-gen Nav, bluetooth, XM, and some of the stuff on the '04 LS430. Improved handling and performance, 0-60 in the low 5s, AWD, solid build quality, new design ---> translates to a winner !

syswei,

You're right Lexus shouldn't try to do the model layout like the Germans do, but at the very least they need one tuner product based on the next GS. AWD would definitely be a welcome addition to the GS and LS lines, as would another engine option for the LS and SC models. That would go a long way towards acceptance in the higher-end segments.

bluestar1,

One thing...the next GS is going to need far more than 350hp if it wants to be a BMW killer, that is if you're talking about going after the next M5 (500hp). Now if you're talking about a 545i Sport competitor then such a GS would be just the right car.

The FX and Pacifica. The Pacifica is a fine vehicle hampered by two things. It needs more power, either a re-worked V6 or better yet a V8 option. Next it produced a lot of sticker shock for Chrysler customers. It would have been a runaway hit without those two problems. The Infiniti FX is way too sporty in ride and smallish in demensions to compete with the upcoming R-Class and the HPX.

Marketing types refer to these as ""halo"" products. You or I may walk into the MB or BMW showroom to drool all over an E55 or M3, but are much more likely to drive out in an E320 or 325i. Also, as both of these cars are closely related to the mainstream models, development costs are not too high to support the business case to build them.

We'll all be impressed and then buy the more mainstream 6 or 8 cylinder product that delivers 80% of the performance, 90% of the image at 75% of the price. Same formula as the Germans.

Finally, look no farther than Ford with it's GT program or the Viper. Chrysler gives away more Town & Country's in a year than it sells Viper's, but what gets the publicity!

Looking forward to that Lexus ""supercar"" and the inevitable Car & Driver ""comparison"" that selects the ""flavor of the month""!"
3225,"November 13, 2003 11:14AM",tasillo,"Anybody see yesterday's (11/13/03) USA Today business section? Front page article was about the increasing complexity of today's high-end cars and the difficulty of repairing them when something goes wrong. Specifically, the article referenced the BMW 7 series and Mercedes E class owners as having had their troublesome cars bought back as they could not be fixed reliably or quickly. Small reference to Cadillac and no reference at all to the Japanese makes. Is USA Today ""piling on"" the Germans? Or are the issues the provence of the Europeans????"
3226,"November 13, 2003 11:37AM",michael_mattox,"The Germans have built a reputation for cutting edge Technology....They believe that gives them great public visability and they are right.

The price they pay is the rush into production The need to be first with the greatest and latest.

The Japanese are not great inventors but they are terrific at taking existing technology and making it MUCH better.

The consumer has a choice buy german and get the latest and greatest at a higher price or buy Japanese and get the tech. a year or so later and get it in a form that will be very dependable and in some case better and get it at a lower price.

Why a lower price...The Germans have done the initial R&D, the expensive part, They need to recoupe that cost...Secondly.. being first with something new and great allows for a higher price.
Third...The Germans know there will be additional warrenty expenses on new technology that they will need to pay for."
3227,"November 13, 2003 11:42AM",ljflx,"I think the answer is simple. The Japanese are far better at mastering technology than the Germans. Thus they should be leading that revolution in the car. It's a natural but it also means a change from the historical mainstream. But the Germans have always led in engineering and are trying to lead to maintain their image as leaders. But it's not working because they are in uncharted territory for them - where they can't lead. Technology is young whereas auto engineering is pretty mature and was well mastered by the Germans. If this was the stock market you know where the money would be. Well actually - now that I think of it that is the case - TM has a much higher multiple than everyone else

By the way - you've got to be careful with that halo effect. Buying an internet company was supposed to have a halo effect on your stock price a few years back. Auto mfrs. better build those halo cars spectacularly."

You ever consider how many Japanese engineers are in Germany and to what extent Japanese technology has benefitted from German cross fertilization. If someone wants to invest in TM they can go read the portfolio. In the meantime it would be refreshing to actually discuss present and scheduled luxury vehicles. There just seems to be to much ego or perhaps self justification wrapped up in a lot of these posts. Lighten up and enjoy( wasn't it Nissan that said "" life a journey...enjoy the ride"")."

3230,"November 14, 2003 8:48AM",tasillo,"I agree to an extent that we've denigrated to a discussion of which country makes the better product. However I think the discussions are worth continuing in this forum because they point out a significant difference in the philosophies of the companies based in Europe vs. those in the Far East.

In my humble opinion (and actual ownership experiences), the European automakers place the premium on the driving experience while the Japanese builders place their premium on the ownership experience. One is not better than the other, it's just what is important to the individual. I'm willing to put up with a few foibles in my BMW in order to savor the high level of performance and driving enjoyment this car provides. My father would never leave the Lexus family (after years of owning BMW, Mercedes, Audi and Jaguar) as for him it's all about the ease of ownership. Neither he nor I is ""right"".

I'm only critical of the European manufacturers (and others critical of the Japanese) for one reason. If the Europeans could ever combine their current superiority in the driving experience with the Japanese's ability to get the details perfect, I'd have nothing left to complain about! Similarly, if Lexus (or Infiniti) ever produce an LS 430 that rewards the driver like a 7 series or S class, I'd likely switch marques immediately.

In a nutshell, I don't believe any of us are politicians or harkening back to the days after WWII, rather were a passionate bunch that really wants our brand of choice to be as good as it can be. Hopefully, the good folks at Daimler-Chrysler, BMW, Lexus and the others monitor forums like these."
3231,"November 14, 2003 10:29AM",ljflx,"You should drive the LS430 with the euro suspension option particularly the 2004 edition.

3232,"November 14, 2003 10:51AM",oac3,"I second ljflx. The 2004 LS430 is a significant change to the previous versions, not in aestethics but in the handling and performance areas. At least that's what I have heard so far."

3235,"November 14, 2003 12:34PM",ljflx,"I will likely do a deal with Lexus this month that is interesting and I believe shows what can get done at this marquee level of car manufacturers.

I had just turned in my LX470 as my lease ended in October. I now have the two LS430's and I only need two vehicles again. But I can't be without an SUV in winter here or in general for a long period with my family needs. I also have to get that third row thus that ruled out the Range Rover. By the way the latter is indeed a great truck and I love the styling. So I cut a deal - at least via phone to swap out an LS430 5 months before the lease ends for an LX470. The math seems to work out to about $2k less than Edmunds TMV and I get out of five months of obligations. Plus the LX works out to be about the same lease payment as I was paying for the LS430. So from a pocket book stand point there is no change for me except I've met my needs much better and have a newer vehicle that stickers $9k above the 2001 LS. If I go through with it I'm taking the LX with everything but night vision and it will sticker at $70k. My wife still wants to test drive the GX though as she likes its size better so I may still have to see if I'm going to do this deal at the GX level, though I doubt it. That truck is a bit too narrow for me. If I do this deal I will likely take a black with the stone gray interior."
3236,"November 14, 2003 12:40PM",bluestar1,"At the dealer last month getting my Nav update, seeing a GX next to an LX is a huge difference in size.

3237,"November 14, 2003 12:44PM",ljflx,The difference is greater still when you drive both. I have and I know the GX won't cut it. She is still intimidated by the LX size.

I am a former BMW owner (5 series and X5) and I think lexus has a winner with this setup.

3240,"November 15, 2003 8:35AM",ljflx,"After going through lease pricing the past 24 hours and looking at the article on residuals of a few days ago I must say I am quite surprised on the fall off in 3 year residual values from 2001 when you view it on a stand-alone basis. At that time when I was shopping MB and Lexus I was getting residuals in the 62-67% range on the LS430 and S430/500. I looked at my LX470 lease and it had a 62% residual while my 2001 LS430 has a 64% residual. These were all 3 year, 36k mile lease residuals. So why are car residuals in general falling. The only thing that comes to mind is the big drop in interest rates. In late 2000 and early 2001 you could have safely gotten 6.25% - I know as I tied up money in a 5 year Cd at 6.5%. So if you laid out $60k to buy a car you effectively had foregone $71,500 (using 6% compounded) in cash after 3 years. Today with rates about 3% lower that same car ends up being $65,600 interest affected after 3 years. Thus in order to keep everyone from leasing instead of buying and in order to keep lease prices stable to 2001 type levels you need to lower the residual percentages. If interest rates go back up the residuals will probably rise with them. I guess it's the only way for the lease market to keep itself stable and in check in such a rapidly declining interest rate period.

So I went and checked Edmunds TMV's for 2001 and I found that the LS430 I bought was at $37,319 on a dealer trade-in or 61% (vs the 64%) of 2001 MSRP and at around 66% on a private party deal. The S-class however was a bigger problem as it retained 58% of its value on a trade-in whereas it was supposed to keep 67%. In fact it only held to 63% on a private party deal. MB must be hurting on this given the sales dollars were higher. How they are not concerned is beyond me. Regardless though both of these percentages - even just at trade-in are well above those being set today.

Per Edmunds - Lexus and MB dealers will sell you both cars at 71% and 67% of the 2001 MSRP though. So what is a car worth 3 years and 36k miles out? I don't think it will be in the 50-54% range but I'm not sure it will be as high as 2001's retained percentages either. Hybrid technology may hurt future values of today's cars but the biggest factor may be interest rate changes and their effect on lease residuals."
3241,"November 15, 2003 9:35AM",ljflx,I'm really surprised as to how far the pre-owned market has fallen for them. The S-430 which was $14k more than the LS430 when I was cross shopping in 2001 is now worth only $5k more per edmunds. The S-500 that was $23k more is now worth only $11k more. The E-430 4-matic I priced which was $1500 cheaper than the LS430 is now worth $4k less. The dealer retail is equal to the buyouts I would have gotten and in the case of the E-class is lower!
3242,"November 15, 2003 11:14AM",footie,"ljflx

The other issue is that the dollar has weakened relative to both the Yen and Euro. This means that it takes more $ to buy a yen or a Euro than it did in 2000.

So by reducing residuals the captive Toyota and MB finance businesses increase the dollars they get over the course of the leases they issue now. They do this to hedge the price of dollars to purchase the yen/euros they need at the right interest rate to return the yen/euros they loaned out to lease or finance the car.

Given the U.S.'s Starfleet-sized trade deficits (which are financed with money borrowed from these same two sources) and our huge forecasted deficits the dollar is likey to stay weak unless we raise interest rates. That won't likely happen until after the next election because of its impact on the housing market and car sales.

As you suggest, I would guess that we'll continue to see these residuals until the interest rates go up."

For the Lexus guys on the board - The LS, GX, RX, SC and ES are selling so quickly that it is not easy to deal on them and in some cases even get them.. The LX is more negotiable but is also selling well. The GS and IS are slow."

BTW, I got a chance to finally see the Phaeton. I saw a rather large car sitting in the VW dealers showroom, so it could only be....

My Prediction: The Phaeton won't make it. VW's sales mentality won't cut it with a 88K (W12 model on the floor) car. The salesman that were present were telling everyone to schedule an appointment to see the car, and wouldn't even open it....even for the older (older than me) people there that looked able to buy such a car. The car itself looks ok, though it might be a little on plain side. The A8 definitely looks a lot better. Most people will either like or hate the stretch, upsized Passat look. VW's dealer body simply isn't ready for this car. If you get a chance check one out and let us know what you think.

3260,"November 17, 2003 11:05PM",merc1,"""If you had - say $40k - to plunk down on a car today what would you buy or lease?""

Good question since 40K is about 5K or so above what I can really spend next time around. I'm not sure. Right now the choices would be a C320 Sport (05' model w/changes), A4 3.0, G35 Coupe, Acura TL, and Saab 9/3 Aero (shocked?)....pretty much in that order.

Why these? Well being a big Mercedes-Benz fan I have to consider whatever Mercedes has in the class. Right now the C-Class is in desperate need of a interior facelift. If I had to buy a car right this minute it would NOT be a new C-Class. I can't stand the seats, having to purchase the Comand system to get a in-dash CD, and the overall interior look. I spoke to a couple of MB reps at the Detroit autoshow this past year and they said that these things would be corrected on the 2005 model, and sure enough its been all but confirmed. Question for me is whether or not the freshened car gets here in the spring or next fall.

The only issue I have with the A4 is the ugly, unpainted lower section Audi has forced on the A4 Sedan, curiously enough the A4 Cabriolet is painted all the way down. I don't know if you've noticed the A4 on the road, but this shade of grey that all their lowers are painted in doesn't match anything. Yuck. There was a strong rumor for 2004 that this would be corrected, a very, very close inspection of my Audi dealers entire lot of A4s (20 or so) says that they haven't corrected this most unsightly detail.

What can I say about the G35 Coupe? Driving it almost makes you forget the cheap interior and that rather thickish looking rear bumper. A strong contender for my money.

The Acura TL is a little contrived, inside and out. It seems they've over compensated for years of bland looking, forgettable cars, by trying to give the new TL too many design cues from other cars. That ""character"" line down the side is most out of place. The interior, which knocks the G35 on it's behind as far as quality of materials/assembly goes, is too busy with aluminum and fake wood all competing for attention. They missed the Audi target by a good mile. You should check out the stereo though, its a first...a DVD based system. Even a Mark Levinson devotee might be impressed.

The Saab would be just different purchase, it too like the G35 was a real hoot to drive. Don't know if I want another turbo I4 though, and the interior takes some getting used too, you know Swedish design/ergonomics.

Another shocker: I don't want a BMW!

The C-class is tired looking and it's too small in size to fit the grill and tail lights that were really designed for and work beautifully on the S-class. I really thought Lexus would get the first DVD audio player into a car. Hats off to Acura for it. I know a few people who had Saabs and they regretted it so be careful there.

the lexus 430 new model is a good copy of the mb. it does have nice wood and soft leather and a nicer nav with touch screen, but the back seat is not the same and nor is the image. the name is totally different.

They both have about the same power, but the G35 Coupe looks so much better than the TL. If only the G35C had a better interior.

Something about BMW's new choice of direction in styling has turned me off to the whole brand. That combined with not wanting a new 3-Series (the last good looking one left) have ruled BMW out for me. It used to be Mercedes, BMW and Audi in my book.

A few left turns does not really detract from the bright stars in the den."

Couldn't agree with you more about the A6 4.2 I looked at a used 2003 with 14k miles, black on black with aftermarket 18 inch wheels. It was spectacular! Not the room of my 7, but plenty for 4. Unfortunately, Audi's reputation for big mechanical issues puts me off. Also, for some reason this car was not a certified car, despite being at an Audi dealer. Just the remainder of 4yr/50k miles under warranty. I will say however that a quick drive and those flared fenders have really got me thinking..."

They are known for drop their transmission from time to time, especially the A8. A friend of mine was looking at a 1998 C280 at a Audi dealership, but Audi couldn't sell him the car because the person who traded the C280 in for a 2000 A8 had a trans failure a day after he drove off in the A8. It seems Audi was giving him static about fixing the trans so he began to raise hell about getting his old car back. Not sure what the outcome of this was. A 2000 A8 is in my price range, but oh no. That and insurance (aluminum car) would be too much for me. I wouldn't go near an Audi with ""Audi Certified"" being stamped all over the windshield (lol).

3280,"November 23, 2003 9:14AM",ljflx,"Porsche seems to be having a hard time selling the Cayenne around here. At Ray Catena (who sells Lexus, MB,Jag, Porsche,Infiniti and exotics) I can get a $60K Cayenne for $75 a month cheaper than a $53k GX470. Plus I can do it for only 27 months. So out of curiosity I took it out even though it doesn't fit the needs I have. I found it very disppointing - noisy, bumpy and not very luxurious - so maybe that is why it is being discounted. But it does handle well but who needs or wants that in an SUV. The sales guy told me the interest in the SUV has fallen off quickly - in our area at least. I told him I much preferred a Lexus GX470 or LX 470. He said as long as I was buying from Ray Catena he couldn't argue with me."
3281,"November 23, 2003 6:50PM",ljflx,By the way I also drove a Boxster for the first time. It's my 12 year old son's dream car so I took it out for a spin with him. Loved it. Porsche should stick to what it does best - sports cars.
3282,"November 23, 2003 11:26PM",merc1,"Well I could have told you that you wouldn't like a Cayenne. In all sincerity, anyone that likes Lexus' SUVs, meaning ultra quiet and isolated, isn't going to like any Porsche Cayenne. The Porsche Cayenne, specifically the Turbo is the best performing SUV in the world on-road, and its in the same class as the TLC/LX, RR, G-Wagen, and Hummer in off-road prowess, so of course some might view it as extremely compromised, others will see it as extremely versatile. My only question is did you drive the S or the Turbo, I know that the air suspension makes a big difference in ride, if the Touareg (which I have driven) is anything to go by.

Plus you know how I feel about SUVs, they usually don't hold my attention more than one model year. I loved the X5 when I first saw it at the Chicago autoshow, couldn't care any less about it now. SUVs just aren't my game. Now a Porsche 911 C4S Cabrio, you'd have to put out a A.P.B. to find it after a letting it go on a test drive with me!!!!

So let me guess, a 04' LS, and a 04 GX right??

M"
3283,"November 24, 2003 8:14PM",ljflx,"It was the S and it stickered around $61k. I could get it at $515 per month with $4k down or $699 per month with 0 down - both for 27 months. I'm at a loss to explain Edmunds TMV pricing on this as they say it sells at MSRP. The $53k GX470 goes for $735 per month with zero down and a 58% residusl after 3 years. Either Porsche has the most creative leasing plans on the planet to preserve MSRP pricing or Edmunds has it wrong. In fact when I added up the down payment, lease payments and buyout I was a tad under MSRP without interest effecting anything. Put a present value stream on those future payments even at a low discount rate and I was well under MSRP. The residual on the Porsche was 70% after 27 months so that's just about in-line with the GX470. Finance is my gig but I don't get this one. I didn't realize the Cayenne had that level of off road prowess.

For me - the LS is a certainty. The car is better than ever - tighter than the 2001 base suspension but rides even more silky smooth. The 2004 Euro is also a better handler than the 2001 version. I want to get the Euro though and that is not easy to come by. Lexus is pushing the modern lux package (with or without Euro which is now actually called Sport) or the ultra and doing away with the custom lux per my dealer. If I miss the sport I'll likely go to the ultra lux but that is not till April anyway.

I still prefer the LX470 over the GX470 - simply for size and I prefer the LX styling though the GX does ride better. The LX puts the bumps away better but on a highway the GX is the creamier ride. But when you are married you have to make compromises and my wife loves the GX. The alternativve is that I can get the LX but have to get her an RX. No dice on that one. I have my eyes on the SL based on my personal business developments in a year or so - as the toy car - not an RX330.

Now about that Boxster. If I'm a single guy like you and don't have to drive every day that's the car I'd save for. Yes its noisy and not the best riding but it is pure sports car, lots of fun and brings me back to my single days. Cars like the SL and SC don't do that. They are too mature/grown-up. But the Boxster has to be a weekend/leisure car. I wouldn't want it in a rush hour rain or snowstorm."
3284,"November 24, 2003 10:45PM",michael_mattox,"My dealer is telling me Lexus has gone to almost all Ultra to catch up with the demand for that model.

Also said Custom Luxury is Very hard to come by...It is the model that suites my needs if I am to upgrade."
3285,"November 24, 2003 11:58PM",merc1,"That sounds like a hell of a deal on a Cayenne. I know you're going to go for the LX470, but I'd drive a Cayenne Turbo just because, since you have such a good relationship with the dealership. Yep the Cayenne is the swiss army knife of the SUV world.

If you were to buy a SL500 I don't know what I'd do!! Did you ever check out the CL? The CL is Mercedes' best all around car in my opinion. Timeless style and just the right amount of space for two.

Strangely, for some reason I've never like the Boxster. I'm ready for a luxury car, no more pounding, stiff-riding cars for me, at least for a while. Entry-level or a pre-driven mid-level luxury car, is where I'm headed. Either that or a classic ""GT"" car like the G35 Coupe.

Audi says shorter-wheelbase A8, performance variants likely on way to U.S.

 
The 2004 Audi A8 L will probably have some company soon. (Photo © 2003 Ingo Barenschee)
Don&#146;t look for Audi to stand pat with its 2004 A8 L in the North American market. Though the company will offer only the long-wheelbase version of the luxury flagship, starting at $68,500 beginning in June, vice president Len Hunt says a less-expensive, shorter-wheelbase model will likely follow as a 2005 model.

After that, the plan isn&#146;t as clear, but Hunt says Audi is discussing S8 or RS8 performance models for 2005 or 2006 featuring a twin-turbo V8, the 5.0-liter V10 shown in the Nuvolari concept in Geneva, or even a turbodiesel.

All three powerplants would take advantage of the high torque capacity (443 lb-ft) of the A8&#146;s six-speed Tiptronic transmission. The A8 L&#146;s 4.2-liter V8 produces 330 hp and 317 lb-ft of torque."

Besides everything the reviewer said, one area that I must disagree with is the interior. Comparing the Can$92K (test car) XJ8 versus that of the LS430 are, imo, not even close in comparison; here I am giving the nod by a mile to the LS.

XJ8 interior


LS430 interior


The Lexus simply blows the Jag right out of the water ! Where the Jag looks old world, the Lex fits into 21st Century modern lux car. Everything about the interior of the Lex says luxury. I find the Jag seats not as plush as the LS, and certainly not ventilated (cooled) as with the LS430 UL."
3309,"December 1, 2003 8:03PM",pathdoc,In the pictures the Jag has more wood and looks more inviting.
3310,"December 1, 2003 8:03PM",merc1,"Well I can't say that I've had enough time to get use to idrive. I've driven the 745i twice and the OMG 760Li once. I had a chance to take the 760Li for about an hour during BMW's annual charity (Susan G. Kormen) event so I can't really comment on the details about idrive. I do know that it would require time for even me to get used to and proficient with it, and I'm on a computer for 8 hours a day, troubleshooting voice over IP, Frame Relay and other ""technical"" applications. Some that are very menu (detailed as hell!) also. Does the 04' 7 have the same simplified idrive system as the new 5?

 Sadly, the spy photos suggest Mercedes is going the same route with something similar to idrive, but I'll keep hope alive until the new S is unveiled next year at Geneva.

Call me biased, but I've always regarded Mercedes' seat shaped design the best in the industry for obvious reasons. The BMW reminds me of the Pontiac Bonneville a relative of mine had back in the 80s'. It required 12 different buttons to adjust the seats, as opposed to just a simple seat shaped control like MB and now just about every other manufacturer uses, though only a few got the patent permission to use them on the doors. Infiniti tried to do this back in 1990 and got hauled into court for this and lost, but that's another story. But everyone uses the simply 2 bar control, seat cushion and seat back control whether or not it's on the side of the seat on the door, it's easier to use. There are variations on the theme, but I've seen nothing that works better. All those buttons and a rotary knob is just overkill for the sake of doing so. I did get comfortable in the 7, but it took way too much time to do so, compared to a simple 2-bar seat control.

BMW used to make fighter jet inspired ""cockpits"" that were relatively simple (for a Euro car) to operate. When I first drove the 7-Series I was shocked as to all the changes and more importantly I kept thinking ""why"".

I too like how the German brands don't give too many details about a new car before launch. The only thing is that most of us who follow Euro brands can kinda tell when something new is due especially when you look at the years any given car has been on the market. I can predict MB changes and new models better than the average dealer. For some reason they either don't know or always pretend not to know about something new. I suspect it's a little of both. One reason is to keep the older cars moving (S-Class for example) and then again they aren't privy to the info some of the mags get until months later.

I'm already tempted to sign up for this GS car instead of getting a toy car. It will be AWD and likely come with a hybrid option as well. Looks like a grand slam for Lexus to me. I wonder how they are going to transform the conservative LS into this next platform. I would also expect that Lexus will bring out the HPX at the same time as this next GS.

By the way what do you think of the Honda S-2000. Isn't that a potential car for you? It would have been on my short list if I were in your life stage."

I just happen to see the LS430's interior as overdone and trying too hard to look good. It uses wood for shock value, Audi does it more for a backdrop or a structural effect. Sure the LS' interior is higher quality materials than a regular Toyota but the presentation is the same, no style.

And I did take out an A6 4.2 on a test drive last year while looking to buy a lux car. Didn't like it that much. Nope, Audi ain't on my radar in luxury car. Seems the US market agrees since the A8 is pretty much invisible in this class."
3324,"December 2, 2003 11:40PM",merc1,"Well maybe someone can explain to me whats earth shattering or stunning about the LS' interior, because all I see is a lot of wood and pretty much just a better made (materials) version of a Toyota's layout. Really, the Camry Solara and the new Sienna minivan share the same interior architecture, tall center stack and all, only the Lexus is of higher quality materials. Lexus goes for shock value with wood and lots of buttons, the Audi is so much cooler and laid-back, with a touch a retro style to it.

3325,"December 3, 2003 5:35AM",footie,"This Audi layout looks like something from a 1970's GM car to me -- maybe an Oldsmobile or Pontiac. The row of rectangular air vents isn't very appealing.

The console looks like an add-in, do they sell these as a bench front seat version and a column shift?

Having to reach the radio controls by going through the shift lever isn't very good ergonomics. The radio also appears to be titled upward for some odd reason - to catch dust or sunlight or both?

As an aside, having tachometers in cars with automatic transmissions is dumber than nails (Lexus, MB, etc. included). Who in the world would ever drive a car like this in such a way that how close you had the engine to the 'redline' ever mattered.

I'd much rather see the tach space give a display of surrounding traffic based on the radar or laser reflections from the emerging systems for automatically controlling the following distances under cruise control. You know, the ""bogie at 3 oclock display."" Plus it could show the radar and laser police speed detection systems at work. ... Must be the war making me think like this."

Besides looks - and I love the Lexus because I feel like I'm siiting in my living room - the LS430 interior makes every function so easy to do on the fly. The layout is simple, elegant and as logical as it gets. Finally the seats are the most comfortable car seats I've ever sat in. The only problem I have with the LS430 is you can't adjust the nav destination screen while driving but that, unfortunately, is due to the lawyers.

OTOH, the LS and Audi are competing in the full size, luxury sedan space, and hence everything about them must attract the buyer in that space. Fun looking takes second priority over luxurious features and ergonomics. That is where, IMO, Lexus trumps Audi. The LS interior exudes quality and luxury. The Audi says ""German"", spartan, matter-of-factly, and round knobs for controling everything. Not my cup of tea !

Like I said, the Audi A8 ain't burning down dealers doors, are they ? The buying public speaks loudly on what they want and prefer, and the A8 ain't even close to its competitors. Maybe the interior ergonomics (besides the all aluminum body) have a role in its lack-luster sales performance ???"

Highway 1 from San Luis Obispo to Monterey in 5th (or 6th) gear and tell me you enjoyed it.If you don't like sporty driving then I guess you don't need a Tach. but for those of us that do it is more important than the speedometer (especially if you keep your radar detector on at all times).

Michael - merc1 is not a fan of Lexus designs and has said he thought they needed a breakout design to define themselves better. Lexus themselves have said this as well. This new concept which will go across the whole line is certainly that breakout. I'm sure some will love it and some will not. Personally I think the LS and LX (the only Lexus cars I've ever had) are classically styled and all the bashing in the world is not going to change that. Merc has bashed the Lexus designs but acknowledges their accomplishments at the same time. Whether he likes this new design concept is entirely up to him.

Also, I'm sure the Lexus folks are watching closely the cold shoulder the BMW 7, 5 and Z4 are receiving and laughing all the way to the bank.

A true test is to take a look at some of the auto designs that still look good today. The E38 BMW 7 series, the first generation Q45 and the first and second generation Lexus LS class all still look clean and ""new"".

I agree, it just doesn't make for anything special in a 60K+ car.

While some are already calling the Lexus concept a derivative design (Automobile Mag) I'll wait to see the actual car when it's shown sometime during 2004. The car being shown now is just a concept and a hint (usually 80 percent of the production car) of what the real thing will look like. Truth be told I think it's going to be real hard to come up with a look that doesn't borrow something from someone because between Jaguar, BMW, Audi and Mercedes all the different themes (sporty, classical, radical-BMW (mixed results), traditional) are all taken to a degree. That said, it doesn't appear that Lexus is continuing their old practices, as the concept is pretty radical for a Lexus.

Thanks for the credit in post #3628. I'm glad you can see that.

Copying seems to only be brought up at this point by those who can't accept the truth about certain Lexus designs up to this point, as no Benz fan mentioned it this time around.

scottphillip,

Yeah that is pretty ridiculous for 7-Series' seat and transmission controls to be that complicated. I've never ever had to have any controls ""explained"" to me in a German car before, ever..until I first sat in and drove the 760Li. I couldn't believe it.

3350,"December 6, 2003 3:18PM",syswei,"My personal opinion here: the current LS's exterior borrows heavily from the last-gen S. But I think that's about it as far as big-time ""copying"" goes. The IS, ES, GS, SC, RX, GX, LX may not be pretty, but they aren't ""copies"", imho."

I could be wrong. IBM made a big turnaround from what seemed like an irresversible decline.

I think tht BMW is where they are because they were an 'Apple of the Car Industry'..upscale, highly styled and with a powerful user interface oriented towards driving. Unfortunately between i-drive and the ugly butts they gone DOS and FridayNight Freddy.

It does seem however that car companies are in the business of selling cars and I don't think it matters to them who they sell them to. The more cars they sell the more money they make and the more people that are introduced to their product the brighter the companies future.

I will guarantee you that if Mercedes could sell taxi's in this country they would...(they sell lots of them in other countries) They sell cars to Armys for use by generals in other countries. They would crack the rental market if they could and of course they make fleet sales when they can.

 Bottom line a once great car company has lost it's way, they are over priced, have declining sales and are establishing a rep. for a less then reliable product....They don't offer the luxury or ride of a Lexus or the handling and driving fun of a BMW. They are stuck in the middle.

3358,"December 7, 2003 9:59PM",ljflx,"Whether that is 80% of the car or 95+% - what did you think of it?

MB sales - They still sell double what they did 8-10 years ago and they are the most expensive cars. Cutting price would hurt both image and profits (their build and distribution costs are much higher than Lexus you have to remember. Lexus sells more vehicles with less than a quarter of MB dealerships! That's efficiency) Plus they made a pretty big cut in prices already from the last gen cars particularly on the S-class. But it is still a helluva brand and many aspire to it. I doubt they are declining but as the market expands they are definitely getting a smaller slice of the expansion pie than Lexus and BMW are getting. I do think BMW's poor designs will hurt them a lot in the next few years though and you will see Lexus and MB gain at their expense. BMW better be very careful with that 3 series restyle. The C-class will rout it."

3360,"December 7, 2003 11:38PM",merc1,"It simply amazes me how sales are one minute the proof that a car company is finished and the next they don't mean anything. Now, at this very moment Mercedes-Benz has lost it's way because they are not selling as many cars as Lexus, BMW and Cadillac is closing in. There always seemed to be one business minded person in here to understand that Mercedes' sticker prices alone shouldn't have ever allowed them to compete in the sales race. That remains the case I see. Gee, I wonder why Maybach can't outsell Bentley and Ferrari can't outsell Porsche, price shouldn't keep this from happening, it's the cars that aren't up to snuff. Lets not pay any attention to the fact that Lexus' sales dominance over BMW and everyone else is based solely on SUV sales, not their supposed to be oh-so great cars. Yet nobody can see that the IS, GS and even the LS have either fallen in the last year (LS), or never sold good period, GS and IS. Nevermind that Mercedes' competing models either sell at the same rate S vs LS, or better, E vs GS, C vs IS, while costing thousands more. It is written nowhere else than in the Lexus handbook about sales equal the best. Interestingly enough the same problem exists at work with management, crunching numbers until they are silly. No reguard or thought about anything else.

Yep, a 6 percent drop in one month after years and years sales records surely spells the end.

Now Mercedes will resort to selling taxis and turn to fleet sales to make up the difference.

Even Mercedes' traditional market position between a BMW and whatever softer-riding cars that have always existed before Lexus is seen as being ""stuck"". Amazingly this has worked for years and years all over the world, with BMW now having stated their goal is to become more diverse and offer more product to reach their mainl goal of outselling Mercedes worldwide by 2008, yet Mercedes is stuck in the middle. Again this is only in the Lexus handbook of market rules which are dictated by whatever sales numbers are posted in a given month, lets ignore everything else.

Quality control problems with specific components can't be changed in short order with changes at the supplier level, production line, or facelifts to current products, because these things are too expensive, but a styling direction can be changed in short order with what I guess is a cheaper task, a total redesign of cars that have just been introduced. Makes perfect sense to me.

Let me set the scene early, this same crowd will surely cry foul next couple of years, when and if the 1-Series and X3 allow BMW to pass Lexus in sales. They'll say that the 1-Series and X3 aren't ""luxury vehicles"". This same group can't even acknowledge that the Lexus sales juggernaught is being fueled by 1 car (ES300) and two SUVs (RX, GX), yet none of them claim that Lexus is finished despite not being able to give away the IS, GS models.

I've haven't read so much nonsense in quite a while, at least on this board.

Here's in interesting concept that will surely be shot down in minutes after this posting. Since we're dealing in future predictions of gloom and doom. Here's a nice ""what if"" scenarios. What if Mercedes had 3 SUVs to equal Lexus'? Going by the two brands sales relationship in cars, Mercedes' SUVs would sell just as well or better than Lexus', but lets not even think about anything like that because it wouldn't fit in with the current hysteria.

ljflx,

Well honestly its a very sleek concept, but it doesn't do anything for me. It doesn't have any surface details or anything, it just a sleek blob to me. That said, I'll wait for the real car, which should have some more detail to it.

But it will be the equivalent of buying a fake fur coat. There is an elasticity of pricing (particularly in the US) that a luxury brand should not go below. Those cars will break that threshhold.

GX 21,846
LX 6,023
total Lexus 93,884

ML 21,942
G 1,361
total MB 23,303

So what it MB had 3 SUVs instead of 2? Right now, Lexus outsells MB by 4x while offering 1.5x the number of models (and 1.0x the number of variants, since the ML comes in a 350 and 500, and not counting the ML55 and G55).

It is the vehicles that ""aren't up to snuff"", to use your words.

You ask ""What if Mercedes had 3 SUVs to equal Lexus"". And I ask: What if Lexus had as many CAR models as MB does? Lexus has 5 car lines, IS, ES, GS, LS, SC, while MB has 7 lines, C, E, S, CLK, CL, SLK, SL. Lexus has 7 variants of those 5 lines, while MB has 25 variants of its 7 lines (not counting AMG models).

3368,"December 8, 2003 11:18AM",footie,"Just some speculative thinking about how modern systems technology and software enables engineers to reproduce feel and experience:

Re the Lexus sport ride, I think the general trend to provide multiple ride settings is the harbinger of what I think of as Dial-A-Ride, followed by Road and Location aware Suspension settings.

GM's new rheological shock absorber system ( ferroelectric damping ) is adjustable in real-time by Digital Signal Processor technology to provide not only instantaneous response to the 'bumps' encountered, but also the style of the ride in jounce/rebound dynamics.

Since the 'feel' is in software, you can imagine a Dial-A-Ride option in the future. Like BMW for this stretch, hey dial-in a 540i, E320 for this piece, Dial-it-in, Lex for super smooth cruise during the hour long conference call, Dial-it-in.

I wouldn't think that BMW will program in MB nor MB BMW. It will be too hard for them to let go of their 'unique' feel.

Since this is largely electronics based and a such differentiator, I think I know who might. They'll get it right. Imagine copying the 'feel' and driving response. I can hear the howls from Germany now ""voo cannot do dat!""

I know a bunch of RX owners around here and they think of it as more of a car than a truck. Count it however you like but it's not truly in the LX, GX suv family. It's more of an elevated luxury sedan to me. If I bought one I'd still need an SUV. That's my personal judgment point and serves what the determining factor on what the RX330 is to me.

They reduced that car by almost $20k. And a few years back MB reduced prices slightly while attempting to hold to a fixed-price strategy in the showroom. The invoice costs to dealers did not decrease, so the net effect, even now, is that MBs do not have the markup margins they used to. In general, all the luxury marques have attempted to hold the line on increasing MSRPs for the obvious competitive/marketing advantages.

But... a reduced or stagnant MSRP price doesn't mean too much if the cost to the dealers (factory invoice) increases. The price reductions 10 years ago were accompanied by cost reductions as well.

And how would the electronics compensate for something like a lack of rigidity in the chassis, brought about by something like a missing B pillar?

At best, the electronics will allow one to alter parameters WITHIN THE DESIGN ENVELOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE PARTICULAR CAR.

Another factor will be cost. Cadillac probably spent big $$ and massive amounts of time taking the CTS to the Nurbergring and tuning it like BMW does. Do you really think some engineer in a lab in Japan can simulate this data? I don't.

How can you say the 1-Series will fail when nobody even knows anything official about the car yet, other than speculation.

Here is what seperates the thinking in here. Lexus is about luxury first, combined with great stereos and nav systems, all wrapped in leather and wood. Thats the way most Lexus fans will look at every automobile, but that isn't the only formula that works, obviously. BMW is about driving first and foremost. If the 1-Series is constructed of quality materials like all other BMWs and provides that driving feel and performs like a BMW should, the car will be a hit because it will open the doors of BMW ownership to a whole new group of less-monied drivers.

Lexus supporters always say that Lexus has no intentions of offering a car for less than 30K, but the reality of it is that they can't because of already fairly luxurious Toyota models like the Avalon and Camry XLE V6, both of which already crowd around the ES330's base price. Saying they don't intend to isn't as true as saying they really can't.

Now for the SUV ""what if"" component. I knew it would be deemed ""silly"" amoung other things. I, after freely admitting that the ML is no competiton for Lexus' clear-cut dominance of the luxury suv market, merely suggested that if Mercedes had 3 SUVs that were of worth competition that they might sell much better than the (no contest) ML does.

ljflx, as far as Mercedes competiting with the RX300, the ML was actually first to the market, but they misjudged what the next trend would be, which as you state correctly is a car-based, tall car like vehicle now dubbed the ""crossover"". The ML is built like a tradition SUV where the RX is built more like a car, and the RX concept is what is preferred, no arguement from me there. Where you are wrong is the assumption that Mercedes doesn't have a decent car platform to build a RX like vehicle from. The C or E-Class chassis would be perfect for this, but what do you expect them to do, dump the ML, close down a new factory and redesign a new vehicle while throwing all the billions used for developing the ML down the drain? I know you understand that it takes time and money to react to a changing market. The upcoming R-Class (GST) is Mercedes entry into the crossover segment, though at a higher position than the RX. The ML is also switching to a car-based platform for 2005, while I doubt it will be as soft as the RX330. Yes Mercedes, like everyone else didn't see the RX success coming, score one for Lexus.

syswei,

Like all the other sales theories cast so far in here, you're ignoring price. There is no way a 90K G55 is going to every sell in any significant numbers. Lets stay current also, there is no ML55. Yes Mercedes has more car lines than Lexus, but when are you going to look at the sticker prices for all those Mercedes models you're citing as being a selling advantage over Mercedes. Doesn't the IS/ES compete with the C-Class, the GS with the E, the LS with the S, the SC with the CLK and to a lesser extent the SL? If so then that leaves the SLK and the CL as the models that Lexus truly has no answer for. At least a half-dozen ""variants"" of some of the MB models you listed sell for over 100K, yet you're citing them advantages when it comes to sales, come on now, do you really think a CL55, SL600 or even the E55 is the reason why Mercedes sells more cars. One minute AMG sales are the most insignificant sales numbers on the market, now they are implied to be a big reason as to why Mercedes actually sells more cars.

Ultimately, Mercedes having more cars is easily balanced out by Lexus' cars costing thousands and thousands less.

I don't have to look at all the cars Mercedes has to prove my point. When you look at the E320 and the E500 vs the GS300 and GS430, the E wins in sales, quite easliy. Forget the E55 and the E320 wagon, the former a small volume car, and the latter just having gone on sale. The E does over 5K cars a month, take away 1500 of those (even if they wagon and E55 sold that many, and they surely don't) the E still outsells the GS easily, and does so a much higher price.

The S-Class is the same way, it sells just as well or better than the LS does (its really a up/down thing here), and the S55 and S600 models only account for maybe 150 cars a month in a good month.

Using the prevailing logic in here, the amount of cars Lexus sales says they're cars are just as below-snuff Mercedes SUVs are considering how Lexus' cars sells compared to always more expensive Mercedes cars. To look at, and use sales numbers as the sole basis for coming to such a conclusion is plum-ridiculous, but that is what was implied about Mercedes yesterday on this very board, while not even looking any other facts.

You totally missed the SUV ""what if"". It went like this, what if Mercedes had 3 SUVs priced like and just as capable as Lexus'. I already know that the ML and G don't compare, you're only proving my point about Lexus' sales lead being based on SUVs.

My point for bringing all this up is that you and others are not looking at the total picture when drawing all these uninformed conclusions about the demise of Mercedes-Benz, based on sales data. You're right we don't have to deal in what if type reasoning, and I almost never do, only did so because of the rampant speculation going on, but you're not dealing in ALL the facts about the REAL market either.

Aren't you the one that said over and over that the SC430 doesn't compete with the SL500, XK8, 911 and the like because of it's price? Yet you're ignoring this very same thing when it comes to sales, pretending it has nothing to do it.

And that is wrong because there is no way a car that starts pricewise in most cases where another car tops out, like in the case of the LS430 vs the S-Class, could you ever expect to outsell the cheaper one, at least by any significant margin. (Yet Mercedes does in some cases!) In order to make such a broad sweeping rationalzation that the market doesn't think Mercedes' are worth the extra $$, you'd have to know that each and every LS430, GS, SC etc buyer can afford the equivalent S, E or SL model, yet chose to buy the cheaper Lexus. You simply can't make such an assumption.

If you can't see that Mercedes' sales are also limited by price then you're not dealing in the reality of the market. Do you expect Ferrari to sell as many cars as Porsche, they compete with each other also, but at different prices. If the Mercedes CL or SL were 30K cheaper do you think it would have an effect on sales? Of course it would, its common market sense.

If you feel that the market doesn't think Mercedes' are worth the premium then I'd like to know your reasoning as to why the S-Class sells as good or better than the LS430, the E way better than the GS ever did, the SL at about the same rate as the SC, despite the huge price differences.

It seems to me that the market does think *certain* Mercedes' are worth the premuim because despite thousands of $$$ more, as they buy these Mercedes models in the same or better numbers as the cheaper Lexuses. The reverse could be said here with these models, if these Lexus models are so good then why can't they outsell the competing, and more expensive Mercedes models. I would never say that because there are obviously other factors to consider, which you're ignoring when speaking favorably about Lexus.

The only area where Lexus kills Mercedes sales/product wise is SUVs, of which there is no argument from me, but to make such a broad statement like you made above about all of Mercedes' cars is simply not based on the facts.

The SL500 vs SC430 relationship isn't the same as the LS vs S relationship. The SC430 doesn't offer anywhere near the technology, styling, engineering or the sheer experience of the SL, to name a few things, without going into much detail. The LS430 is a whole lot more competitive with the S-Class than the SC is with the SL. The SC430 is a fine car for what it is, bascially a 2-door convertable LS430, but its no GT car.

- lack of heritage
- lack of a 117-year history of innovation
- lack of ""halo"" models (V12s and AMGs)

High end watches have moved on, Rolexes are gauche, and why buy one when every car salesman has a knock off Presidential? (There are even web sites that compare the movements in the knock offs and rank them!) In short, the high end watch market has moved on and Rolex is less and less an aspirational brand. If Rolex were a stock traded here in the US, you would want to sell it short. My comments about Rolex apply to MB. Sure they are moving some cars because as an earlier poster claimed ""they scream success"" but once the underlying story gets out the brand will lose its cache. Truly successful people won't want any part of it. When the wannabes move in, there goes the neighborhood. MB (D-C)stock probably should be shorted.

syswei,

"" I certainly do see high prices as a handicap hindering MB sales.""

Finally, that was my point. Your implication earlier was that Mercedes didn't sell better simply because the market didn't think they were worth the extra $$$, while assuming that everyone buying a competiting Lexus could afford the competing Benz model, yet chose a Lexi.

I never said Lexus wasn't without their own ""handicaps"". Then you still say that Lexus outsells Mercedes, again true, but long as you know why this is so. It isn't because of what you tried to imply earlier. Lexus' so called handicaps, arguably aren't anything compared to a brand like Mercedes taking the amount of bad press they've taken over the last few years. To put it in the best Lexus fashion, heritage and unaffordable AMG/V12 models don't mean much when the everyday C320 and S430s are unreliable.

""So MB has 3 variants that are priced lower than the very cheapest Lexus, yet looking at the sales numbers for the total lineup, still doesn't outsell Lexus.""

Lexus can't do much about the handicap we call lack of heritage (other than allow time, and lots of it, to pass)...whereas MB can and obviously should do something to fix its reliability issues.

2. You wrote, ""The C-Class outsells the IS300 by a huge margin.""...and while that is factually true, it misses the point of my post 3682. The point is (as I tried to indicate with wording like ""the ENTIRE product line"" and ""the total lineup"") that the totality of MB's line (all cars, all SUVs) starts at a lower price point than Lexus. Yet MB total vehicle sales still trail Lexus'. Since the C starts 13% lower in price than the cheapest Lexus, it makes it harder for you to argue that MB trails Lexus in vehicle sales because of too-high pricing.

BTW, even if you want to interpret my original post as pertaining only to the C, not MB&#146;s entire line, for some reason you chose to compare sales of the entire C-Class to the IS alone, conveniently leaving out the ES. Now, the C ranges from $26,020 to $37,630 (not counting the C32 AMG or wagon) while the ES starts at $32,350. If the ES shouldn&#146;t be added to the IS when comparing to C-Class sales, then what does the ES go up against? The $48,170 to $56,270 E-Class?

3. Lastly, as far as your comment &#147;checkout your local Benz dealers lot and tell me if you see any base cars sitting around at those prices you listed&#148;there are indeed cars around at those prices. The Autonation network has four C230K Sport Coupes IN STOCK within $1000 of the $26,020 price I posted, and in fact one unit at exactly that price. The same dealer network has exactly zero IS cars in stock within $1000 of the $29,980 price. The lowest-priced in stock IS is $31,629so your implication that the MB and Lexus website prices don&#146;t represent real-world availability actually seems to be more true of Lexus than MB. In fact in the real world maybe the cheapest MB isn&#146;t 13% cheaper than the cheapest Lexus, it is 18% cheaper...yet Lexus still outsells MB (total product line)."

I meant that all the negative press has been a sales handicap, not the problems themselves, they are just that problems. I'm sure Mercedes has lost more than a few sales with the survey worshiping crowd.

2. Your second point is dead wrong and has no basis simply because if Mercedes has, according to you 3 cars that cost less than the cheapest Lexus, then they surely have at least 10 that cost way more than any Lexus, CL55, CL500, CL600, S500, S55, SL500, SL55, SL600,
S600, and the E55. You're telling me that all these much higher priced cars don't count?

I clearly stated that the ES330 outsells the C-Class.

""If the ES shouldn&#146;t be added to the IS when comparing to C-Class sales, then what does the ES go up against?""

First of all the C-Class variants are of the same car, with different engines and trims etc. The IS300 and ES330 don't share anything, not even the same engine or platform, so it would be merely reaching to try and lump their sales together. The ES competes with the C-Class to a degree, thats why I stated before that it does outsell the C. I personally find it's biggest competitors to be Buicks, which is what it rides/handles/drives like, although it's much better built. And probably the I35, which is about the only other foreign car playing the fwd card in this price class now. The Acura TL has moved towards being sporty.

3. So basically you just proved what I said, out of the whole Autonation group you found 4 base C230s, yet according to you they're so plentiful to the point of pumping up Mercedes' sales numbers. Right. Remember I never even mentioned Lexus' MSRP's vs what they actually had available, you're just now mentioning that.

Now again what does the price relationship of the IS and the base C models have do with the entire Mercedes lineup of cars compared to Lexus'? Do you not see that Mercedes is just as loaded with big $$$ cars as they are with cheaper ones? Especially compared to Lexus. No because that wouldn't fit in with your theory.

""The point is (as I tried to indicate with wording like ""the ENTIRE product line"" and ""the total lineup"") that the totality of MB's line (all cars, all SUVs) starts at a lower price point than Lexus.""

That simply doesn't mean much because Mercedes sells a good number of E, S, and SL cars, relative to their competion, and like unlike Lexus, Mercedes sales gains of the past few years weren't made on just one car and 2 SUVs, they were made on nearly everything they sell, except the ML and SLK. Plus, plus the C's starting priced compared to the IS300's isn't repeated anywhere else in the lineup of these two brands. The E320 surely doesn't base for less than the GS300, the S430 most certainly doesn't base for less than the LS430, ditto SL500 vs SC430. Again, we see who's cars really costs more.......

""yet Lexus still outsells MB (total product line). ""

Yes they do because of SUVs!! You keep stating this while trying to show me sales numbers for C-Class cars, of which only the ES330 manages to outsell it, WHAT ABOUT THE E vs the GS, S vs LS, SL vs SC, C vs IS........the relationship in each case either a) Mercedes outsells the Lexus, or b) they are in a dead heat.

You're trying to attribute Lexus' sales lead to cars, and it isn't. Then on top of that you're claiming that because 3 Mercedes' are cheaper than the IS300, that Lexus has made some kind of stunning achievement based on car sales, when the reality (cold and the hardest of numbers) of it is that Mercedes outsells or sells the same amount of cars as each competing Lexus car model. The one and only exception to this is the C-Class vs the ES330. The sales dominance you keep harping on isn't based on Lexus' car sales!!

What you're doing is like comparing a company like Ford to Honda, and claiming that Ford outsells Honda, which is true, but like you know who, Ford's truck sale numbers are extremely impressive, while Honda sells more Accords........its the same exact scenario.

The bottom line is that if you going to look at how many cars Mercedes has that are cheaper (3) than the cheapest Lexus, then you have to look at how many they have that are more expensive than any Lexus, without even looking at the MB website I count 10. Ten compared to Three!!!

I agree that ultimately the SUV vs CAR things is really irrelvant because in the end total sales is what will be counted up for the press releases due Jan 1, 2004. I'm only using the seperation of the two because you're trying to act like Lexus sales lead is due to moving more cars which couldn't be any further from the truth.

3403,"December 12, 2003 12:12AM",oac3,"Great point. And I have to echo your voice of reasoning here on the SUV_vs_CAR sales [non-permissible content removed]-for-tat. GM would be out of business today if it were not for SUV's. Ditto FoMoCo. What the heck is Merc1 smoking these days, anyway ? Lexus outsells all luxury brands in the NA market. Period. No amount of armchair quarterbacking and excuses is going to change the situation unless other lux makers address their weaknesses and compete better against Lexus, wether it is in price, quality, reliability, customer service, etc.

All we hear from MB fans are excuses why OVERALL MB sales are declining against the competition. Only a little less than 5 years ago, MB was the #1 selling lux brand in America, now they are about to fall to #4 and all we hear are excuses why Lexus sales are dominated by SUV's and not cars.... blah blah blah... I hope MB execs are not listening to these stuff from fans like Merc1, lol !

I am sad to report that there has been little buzz out here in Tokyo (the city I visited) about Lexus. A couple of people I talked to say that the news is kinda low key and they remain skeptical of Lexus in Japan. A few who are huge BMW fans say they are not affected by the new faces of the 7- and the 5-, and want to own BMW's regardless. From my little, unscientific probe here in Tokyo, I think Toyota/Lexus needs a lot of marketing ad campaign to sell Lexus in Japan. Maybe they'll wake-up the populace here to the merits of a Lexus brand in Japan. Maybe they won't. I guess we'll see.

Oh, my company VP here in Tokyo drives an S500, and I got to ride with him (chauffered, of course) to dinner on Friday. Car was black/black and drove like a dream. Creamy smooth, and very luxurious. I sure felt good in the back seat. Plenty of leg and elbow room. The Nav in the car looked so good, almost Lexus-like."
3404,"December 12, 2003 2:18AM",merc1,"You mean to honestly tell me you can't see where syswei is pointing to Lexus' entire product line as the main factor as to why Lexus' sales are so high? My only point about that is that their entire product line doesn't sell like all the hype in here would suggest it does. He acts like every Lexus model is a star seller like the ES or RX, and it simply isn't true.

Seriously, all these facts go right past you?

If you can't understand that a much higher set of sticker prices would hinder #1 sales status then you're not dealing in reality. There is no way the brand with highest sticker prices can be a bestseller in todays market. When they did accomplish this it was the introductory year for the CLK and M-Class, two models that were arguably cheaper , especially the ML, than most (not all) other Mercedes' at the time. And ironically it was the ML (an SUV) that did most of that sales growth, proving once again this the hottest segment and what drives you know who's sales machine.

You're saying that other automakers need to address their weaknesses in order to compete with Lexus, like Lexus has no weaknesses. Hopefully for Lexus they aren't thinking that way about the GS and IS.

This was all brought about by two things. The implied notion that Mercedes' cars weren't good enough to sell better, forgetting that that cost more. Secondly, that Lexus cars are better so they sell more, when in fact they don't sell more cars. They do sell more vehicles total, because they do sell a better collection of SUVs, but going by the first point it would seem the implication is that Mercedes' cars are better, at least going by syswei's more sales = better car theory. Since this theory is based on the assumption that everyone who bought a Lexus looked at a Mercedes and decided on the Lexus.

It's amazing that I'm often accused of not able to see anything good about Lexus, but I do give Lexus it's just credits on reliability, quality, service etc. Yet the fact that Mercedes sells it's more expensive cars at an equal or most often better rate than Lexus does, it says nothing about their market presence or penetration and is lost on everyone...and therefore means nothing.

Boy if Lexus had a more expensive car than a Mercedes that sold better, you'd never hear the end of it!

If xyz&#146;s line runs from 40k-140k, it would also be easy to see that xyz &#147;should&#148; sell fewer vehicles. But if xyz&#146;s line runs from 26k-140k, as MB&#146;s does, just why should they be selling fewer vehicles that Lexus, which runs from 30k-71k?

To my ""yet Lexus still outsells MB (total product line)&#148; you replied &#147;Yes they do because of SUVs!!&#148;. So? If, 10 years from now, MB outsells Lexus in total vehicles, but does so on the strength of SUVs, does that make the achievement less significant?

You accuse me of ""trying to act like Lexus sales lead is due to moving more cars"" and I don't see how an honest reading of my posts could result in that conclusion. My posts have including wording like ""ENTIRE product line"" and ""the total lineup"" and ""the totality of MB's line (all cars, all SUVs)"" and, a few days ago, ""poor-selling GS""."

Because they only have a few cars at that 26K price point you keep pointing to, did you not see all the ones that list for more than 71K? Mercedes has more cars that list over where Lexus tops out at, and there is no way those three cars below Lexus' cheapest model could sell that many to make a difference. There are at least 10, count them TEN Mercedes' that list for more than 71K, compared to only 3 that you listed that cost less than 30K. Six of those list for over 100K, a place where Lexus isn't represented. It's very simple. You keep talking about the C-Class, which again, like I stated earlier is the only Mercedes that has a base MSRP less than a Lexus. One Class of cars compared to 6 other models lines of MBs that sticker for higher than their Lexus competitors. How in the world can one model line (C) offset this? It can't.

""If, 10 years from now, MB outsells Lexus in total vehicles, but does so on the strength of
 SUVs, does that make the achievement less significant?""

No of course it doesn't. I clearly stated in my previous post why I made the distinction. But you refuse to see the reason why Mercedes will probably never win the sales race...and really can't be expected to win a sales race.....their MSRP's are much higher overall.

""My posts have including wording like ""ENTIRE product line"" and ""the total lineup"" and ""the totality of MB's line (all cars, all SUVs)""
and, a few days ago, ""poor-selling GS"".""

Again, I said anything to the contrary because you initially stated that Mercedes' cars didn't sell more because they were poor cars, and I responed that Lexus'cars must be lesser because Mercedes sells more cars. If Lexus dominates in SUVs, Mercedes does in cars, based on your more sales = better car theory. I know you were implying overall, including cars and suvs, but that goes back to you ignoring the price differences.

Put it this way, suppose Timex 14 years ago had introduced a new, luxury watch brand, called Lex, lets pretend. And let&#146;s say that everyone in the world recognized Lex as being EXACTLY as desirable as Rolex, Cartier, Brietling, etc., EXCEPT for prestige. Don&#146;t you think that Rolex should be able to command higher prices, but still sell the same number of units as Lex?

Also, your statement flies in the face of two facts:

1. MB&#146;s higher prices have &#150; in the PAST &#150; not prevented it from being the number one unit seller

2. On an individual model level, some MBs, such as the E, outsell the relevant competition, despite the higher prices"
3410,"December 12, 2003 4:11PM",footie,"Just so we all understand, even though MB would llike to be able to charge a prestige-based price premium alone, they unfortunately have to add a very significant warranty cost to the price of each car due to their lower reliability and much higher incidence of service calls than Lexus, Infiniti or Cadillac.

Some consumers may be thinking that they are paying for prestige with that higher MSRP, but in fact, they are prepaying the service requirements that their vehicle is most certainly going to have during the warranty period.

Lexus and Infiniti are in the enviable position of being able to sell very competitive offerings at a lower price with similar services and warranties and still make very good profits because they don't have to spend near as much of their gross margin on warranty work.

I think the other part of the 'prestige' pricing difference goes into MB's relatively huge merchandising and advertising campaigns.

It's all about money."

That happened for ONE year, one single year. Hardly proof of anything. It's seems as though you're determined to forget certain key points that I have already listed in previous posts. The year Mercedes was #1 in the luxury market, they did it with a (at the time) brand new SUV. JUST LIKE LEXUS DOES IT NOW. They never did this with pure car sales. I honestly don't know why that is so hard to see.

Now, after about 6 posts you clearly recognize that despite Mercedes higher prices they outsell Lexus on certain models, but yet you expect them to be able to outsell Lexus totally because of that..........again you're ignoring the SUV component.

You also keep ignoring the fact that MB has at least 10 cars that costs more than any Lexus. You're acting like 3 C-Class models priced under Lexus are going to make up for the 10 that are priced way above any Lexus and put Mercedes first in sales. Thats backwards. It 3 vs 10. You can't see that MB's lineup is skewed towards the middle and top end?????? They sell most of their cars for 45-50K or better, right where Lexus tops out, average sales wise. Only the SC430 and LS430 consistantly sell for a higher average price than 50K. The GS430 sales as if it's about as rare as a M5 or AMG product.

Like you stated earlier the ""what if"" and now ""lets pretend"" stuff is silly but... The answer to your overall question is NO because unless the ""Lex"" costs the same as a Rolex, Brietling there is no way the higher priced brands are going sell in the same numbers. What you're reaching for doesn't exists. Curiously enough you left price out of the ""pretend"" scenario. Rolex's and Brietling's watches costs as much as some of these cars we're talking about here, how in the world would they every sell in greater numbers than a much cheaper brand. That doesn't make sense.

I mean in all seriousness you should really research this. Since anyone can remember Cadillac was #1 in unit sales. Why? Becasue their best selling car, the DeVille used to costs about what the ES330 costs today, that combined with lots of fleet sales put them over the top year after year. The SUV (Lincoln Navigator) is what caused Lincoln, for the first time in the modern era to surpass Cadillac for #1 in 1998. Cadillac was so devestated by this they actually tried to lie about their sales numbers. Mercedes was never, ever in the running until the ML came along. Mercedes' best year prior to the intro of the ML was 1986!!! Even in that year, they didn't sell more than 100K units. True they outsold BMW for years and years, but that too changed in the 90's because BMW became red-hot (with the 3 and 5) and they too costs less, in most cases, not all. Nor does BMW try to sell so many cars at the top end. BMW has only one car over 100K, the 760Li. The Z8 is winding down now, and it never did more than 300-400 units a month. The ML and to a much lesser extent the CLK (20K in a good year), which is a lot cheaper than the previous E-Class based Coupe got Mercedes into the sales race. Only since 2002 did they decide to add so many C-Class variants that I sometimes can't keep track of all of them.

Detroit? Oh yes, I'll be there, it's the single most important autoshow in America. There is so much debuting there (Corvette, Ferrari 612S, SLR, 6-Series, surprises from Audi, BMW and others) this year that it should be mandatory for anyone that even remotely likes cars....lol.

footie,

Yep those are the only reasons a Mercedes costs more and a Lexus or Infiniti costs less. It has nothing to do with most of those Lexuses and Infinitis being based on much cheaper every day cars to begin with. Nor does Lexus advertise as much, and Toyota's total advertising couldn't be more expensive for having to advertise for both Toyota and lexus compared to singular advertising for Mercedes-Benz. It's amazing what you can come up with when you only look at half the picture.

ljflx,

""To an enthusiast the SUV doesn't count. To a car manufacturer the enthusiasts who thinks like that is irrelevant. ""

And likewise enthusiasts reguard Lexus as being irrelevant. And these enthusiasts do count, other wise BMW, Audi and to a lesser extent Mercedes wouldn't sell as many cars as they do. Your assesment works both ways.

3421,"December 13, 2003 1:39PM",pablo_l,"To each their own, I see now Lexus similarities whatsoever. And I have no emotional investment in either brand. I think the future Benz S looks refreshingly sporty, far less bulbous than its competitors have become. Of course you have to see the car in person to make sure it's not just a flattering angle.

It'll be interesting whether it pays off for Benz to offer as many higher end models : S, GST, CLS... though I am sure it's part bin magic and they've kept the cost down. There'll have to be come cannibalization of model sales - I suspect the additional models will eat away at E and S sales, and not only at rivals' models. I guess the overall increase in market share, even at increased cost of sales, is the strategy there. It's good for buyers, though, one's got to commend Benz for offering more choice."

They days when people bought Taurus-like cars en masse are over. Semi-luxury is the standard these days.

As to MB missing on trends, last I checked the M class actually initiated the image urban SUV trend. All Lexus had at the time was the LX, and that was not and is not a high volume car, highly competent SUV as it is.

Finally, if revenue is a validation of anything, Daimler Chrysler's revenue was $160B last year, Toyota's $100B. Financially, the DC/MB recipe seems to work."

As to SUVs, again, Merc started the cute-SUV trend with the M class, like it or not, and did a great marketing job with placement in Jurassic Park and such. People scooped them up like mad, and it has been a very profitable model for Benz. And the BMW X5 still wins fair amount of tests, and sells quite well (I've never liked it, though). We own an M, I just view it as a mere utility because to me all SUVs are actually garbage as fun transport.

Then they ease that Balance Sheet build-up in a low sales quarter. That's why I feel sorry for the investor who buys on earnings news without looking at a Balance Sheet. You can't hide bad business decisions or faulty accounting on the Balance Sheet unless you create a host of illegal shell company's the way Enron did. Enron also booked revenue unethically. Anyway this is about cars but no one should forget that a well capitalized company has the ability to meet and anticipate market needs the best.

FYI. There's no international 'accounting' rules that apply because those are national rules driven by national tax codes.

3443,"December 14, 2003 6:15PM",ljflx,"Regarding your post last night re funny accounting - It's not easy to fudge the books in manufacturing. The big cash outlays either reduce debt or they have to go somewhere else - capitalized assets (auto plants, new car model development etc) or it goes into deferred costs/work in process/inventory and prepaid auto supplies/parts or it just gets expensed directly. Revenue booking is always tied to cost matching - either on fulfilment or on percentage of completion basis. Service businesses can play games big time because they all define fulfillment differently. But manufacturing started it all so the accounting remains the most straightforward.

Footie - I'm a finance exec so unfortunately I know a bit too much about US GAAP. As for conservatism in bookkeeping it really varies. The Europeans are very conservative on a day to day basis but they have - in the past - written off all intangible assets of acquired companies or the Goodwill attributed to the acquisition to Equity immediately. Technically European acquisitions would be accounted for by reducing cash (or increasing debt) and reducing equity to the extent of the intangible valuation. By American standards that is very aggressive accounting. So if an acquisition is a bad one there is virtually no writeoff risk. To repeat myself in a different way that is hardly a conservative practice when it comes to keeping track of how well acquiitions have done. Some of that is changing now as international standards are being adopted. The American manager always has to live with that potential large writeoff as intangibles are added to assets on the Balance Sheet. So if its a bad one the whole world gets to see it clearly. Plus those intangibles get written down each year against income. So in this vane it is the American system that is conservative. But I know nothing about the Japanese system. They may have ""COPIED"" the Europeans or us or maybe, just maybe they invented their own system.

It's not only me remembering they had some negative financial news at some point in time in the past 3 years, otherwise I'd admit to being confused. Finally, glad that you are now on your former statement on revenues after doing some research of your own. The latter always pays when doing business research, the press tends to have very skewed views for the sake of drumming up newsworthy stuff.

As to manufacturing making funny economics tougher, it would seem several secret facilities in the USA are full with over $50B of telecommunications gear that vendors wrote off their inventory. Supposedly it's in inaccessible storage facilities. That'll sanitize your books every time, especially if you find a way to get the equipment back into circulation. I am just very suspicious of big write-offs followed by very rapid recoveries, again, it gives me the impression people just buy their profits in advance at times - not that it is an accurate perception every time, but lots of very funny stuff has happened in the past decade. Again, I am not saying Toyota does anything dubious, by all means they seem to be a very healthy corporation.

Talking Saddam - I hear he was one of the few buyers of one of the worst cars ever, that horrid Lamboghini SUV they build in the 80s. He supposedly had several of them. Those who criticize the Cayenne would have a field day if that lambo was revived... :-)"
3445,"December 14, 2003 6:55PM",ljflx,That's why you just watch those accounts I noted. In your example they capitalized costs and built up equipment that was not sellable. In auto mfg - watch those new car development costs which are capitalized as the models may not do as well as expected (triggering a write-off) and then relate deferred revenue to deferred costs. A healthy manufacturer will have a near 1:1 ratio or higher on the deferred revenue side. Toyota had a higher defrred revenue amount then they had a deferred costs amount when I last looked meaning they needed to catch up to demand. They also had a healthy relationship of receivables to revenue meaning they were collecting quite quickly as well. Books looked clean as a whistle to me. Trust me - I check out the quarterly Balance Sheets of my investments all the time.

Implicit in many of the statements on this board is the notion that certain cars are OBJECTIVELY, not subjectively, &#147;better&#148; than others. Some would like to use their own notions of what is &#147;better&#148; and try to convince others of their belief. Others would like to rely on the writings of carmag reviewers who have driven a particular car, for free, for hours or days. Personally, I find value in looking at sales data (for vehicles in the same class, not Camry vs Rolls) because such data offers a huge sample size (statistically speaking) of what real buyers value and are willing to pay real cash for, encompassing all the factors that matter to them. I&#146;m not saying that this is the determining factor in my personal choice of vehicle, just that it is interestingand shows which company is doing a better job of meeting real market needs."
3447,"December 14, 2003 7:45PM",syswei,"I am honestly flabbergasted. You claim (post 3711) to believe that if 2 products are of identical desirability except for prestige, the more prestigious can&#146;t command some level of price premium, and still sell the same number of units? Do you see that your view implies that if two products are priced the same, they will sell the same number of units, despite one being higher in prestige and equal in all other ways? Does this truly make sense to you? Prestige doesn&#146;t have a value that people will pay extra for? Frankly, if I can&#146;t get you to agree on something that follows from elementary economic theory, then I am very close to giving up discussing the whole sales/price thing with you. There has to be an agreement on basic principles for rational discourse to take place.

You keep wanting to look at Lexus vs MB as on a model by model basis, saying that on a overall (all SUVs + all cars) basis, MB&#146;s unit sales performance is explained by higher model-by-model prices, and that the higher prices aren&#146;t simply compensation for higher prestige/heritage. Well, if that were true, wouldn&#146;t we find that the model matchups where MB is most expensive (relative to Lexus) are the ones where MB sells poorly, and that the matchups where MB is priced similarly to or less than Lexus are the ones where MB sells well?

In fact the exact opposite is true. It is the matchups where MB is priced similarly to or less than Lexus where MB has its greatest sales weakness. The C-class compared to the ES and IS. And the M-class, compared to the RX and GX. In the other lines, where MB is priced higher than Lexus, MB generally sells the same or higher numbers than Lexusquite the opposite of what your theory implies. (The only exception is the G vs LX, where MB is priced higher and does sell less; but since the LX isn&#146;t a big volume seller itself, the unit [as opposed to percentage] difference isn&#146;t large, so this doesn&#146;t go very far in explaining why Lexus outsells MB).

Here&#146;s my theory. I think that prestige/heritage has a value, and that people will pay extra for it. But people who are concerned about prestige will, if they can afford it, buy towards the high endif they buy a C the neighbors will know that they&#146;ve got the cheapest MB. So MB is able to extract a bigger &#147;prestige premium&#148; (pricewise) on the E and S than on the C or ML350, for example, and still sell well. And since people at the low end are not as concerned about prestige as those at the mid-high end, other factors become more importantlike reliability, roominess, etc. So in my view it isn&#146;t price that explains MB&#146;s sales vs Lexusit is PRODUCT (or product, reliability, service, etc). For the C, where MB sells fewer units than Lexus despite lower starting prices, maybe those factors are roominess, reliability, service. As for the MLwell, you&#146;ve said yourself that MB has a product problem there, that the vehicle isn&#146;t that desirable.

Again, if your price theory were true, it would be the E and S with the (relative) sales problems, not the C and ML."
3448,"December 14, 2003 7:59PM",pablo_l,"I think when people don't know what their own preferences are, they tend to buy what they think others approve of. That's why many buy a Rolex before they even bother to discover Audemars Piguet or Blancpain or some other brand.

Personally, I avoid default choices. Whatever sells well is something I'll most likely avoid.

And by the way, I have never bought a car because I managed to convince myself it was ""better"" than another one. My buying preference is not based on any such conviction. I just don't believe in that - I very much think different people will enjoy different things, and all the power to them. Finally, probably the most desirable cars in all of cardom are severely flawed in some way or the other when it comes to the practicality that characterizes the best-sellers. Whether a car brand does or doesn't meet mass market requirements is not a buying consideration that matters the least to me, that is for sure.

Interestingly, it seems I tend to walk away from brands as they gather more market steam and success: I remember I really jumped through hoops to get my first 3-series ages ago - but then Beemers became omnipresent, and I haven't had one since, even though I know they are great cars. Same with Jaguar - as the S and especially X class started to make them more mainstream, I lost interest in owning a Jag very quickly - it had stopped being a bit of an oddball anglophile choice.

At least, that is my impression.

And of course brand equity is money in the bank, and alows one to charge more. That is business 101, really. Many Merc models exemplify that to an extreme degree. But this is a segment where all offerings do that to some varying degree.

""There has to be an agreement on basic principles for rational discourse to take place""

This is true. So lets loose the what if scenario because it's not based anywhere near reality.

""You keep wanting to look at Lexus vs MB as on a model by model basis, saying that on a overall (all SUVs + all cars) basis, MB&#146;s unit sales performance is explained by higher model-by-model prices, and that the higher prices aren&#146;t simply compensation for higher prestige/heritage.

You're confusing two issues here. This conversation was never about why a Mercedes costs more, only that they do. Who cares why, for the sake of this discussion. We're talking about sales vs price and vice versa. They ""why"" question is for another topic, and there have been some incorrect theories cast about that in here already anyway.

""In fact the exact opposite is true. It is the matchups where MB is priced similarly to or less than Lexus where MB has its greatest sales weakness. The C-class compared to the ES and IS.

Again, the IS300 and ES330 are not even close to being the same car, so why are you constantly trying to lump them together? The C-Class outsells the IS300 by about 3 to 1 on a yearly basis. The ES330 outsells the C-Class, again I've stated this a many times.

The ML doesn't sell better because, again like I've admitted before, its clearly not up the Lexus SUVs, and it's in its 7th model year, and the Lexi are brand new. You're right here, price has little to do with it due to fact the ML is priced similarly to the GX and RX. That is but one exception.

If these are the only two product lines between Mercedes and Lexus in which Mercedes is price competitive, how in the world can that offset the often medium to very large price differences between the GS and the E-Class, S vs LS, SC vs SL, LX vs G, SC vs certain CLK models, and to mention the CL of which there is no Lexus competitor. You're only looking at the lower half of the Mercedes lineup.

""Here&#146;s my theory. I think that prestige/heritage has a value, and that people will pay extra for it. But people who are concerned about prestige will, if they can afford it, buy towards the high endif they buy a C the neighbors will know that they&#146;ve got the cheapest MB.

There are lots of places where this theory doesn't jive with reality. People will pay for prestige yes, but that is only half of the situation.......the other half of that is they'll pay for it WHEN THEY CAN. Prestige means nothing when you want a SL500, but can only afford a SC430. The 30K price difference will, more often than not, make the decision in favor of the SC430. There is no way possible that this kind of price difference doesn't account for some lost sales for Mercedes-Benz.

Ferrari and Porsche are held by many to be the best sports car builders on earth. It depends on who you ask as to which is best. Generally Ferrari gets the nod, but it's a fierce debate. There is no debating however when it comes to sales of the two brands. Price is what keeps a Ferrari out of garages of tens of thousands of buyers, many of whom a Porsche is no-sweat to acquire.

Yes, other factors play a role in cars sales, again, I've mentioned this many times before. Reliability, comfort etc, etc, the list is endless, but to say that price has nothing to do with a brand like Mercedes' who's lineup is skewed upwards of 50K is cleary incorrect.

Look at this:

http://www.mbusa.com/brand/index.jsp

Select the ""Model Selector"" on the left side.

Without even looking to see how many, do you see where most of those cars land on the price chart? The high side. The numbers: There are 14 models below 50K, with the E320 being right on the border at 48K, which you probably can't find at that price on a dealers lot. There are 23(!) models priced above 50K, of these there are 15 priced at 70K or above, right where Lexus tops out at. Of that 15, 8 of them are priced at 90K or above!!!! There is no way this type of pricing doesn't have an effect on overall Mercedes sales.

The bottom line is that Mercedes is only price competitive with 2 lines of cars, the rest are prices higher than the competiting Lexi, and thus really shouldn't be able to sell in the numbers they do. Yet you initially tried to state that the ""market"" didn't think much of Mercedes' cars, yet when you look at the numbers the only thing they are missing is the SUV component. Lexus better hope the next ML, and the new GST (R-Class) and the new G-Class don't catch on.

The correct thing to say would be that the market doesn't think much of Mercedes' ML (and neither do I), but they obviously think a great deal of their *cars* because despite their higher prices they buy more of them overall and model line vs model line, except in the case of the ES vs the C-Class.

We're not talking about a ""pure bred enthusiast"" here. That type would only buy a M Series or to a lesser degree an AMG car. I'm talking about people who look for more than leather, stereos and nav systems as the key ingredients in their cars. People that actually mention driving the car as opposed to ""how soft it rides"". Other things like styling, handling, performance, design. I hardly think the average Camry or Accord buyer can afford anything other than a base 3-Series or C-Class. Most Camrys and Accords sold are stil mid-grade models, most with 4-cylinder engines, not the top line XLE and EX-V6 models.

""My point is that good business plays to where the money is not where the enthusiast is. MB and BMW missed the whole change to the SUV market badly. Maybe they cared too much about the enthusiast.""

Not hardly, they did just that, play where the money is, just not where all of it is. You seem to imply that Mercedes and BMW haven't been a success at what they do, building cars. They are the two leading luxury car sellers in the world. The SUV game is new to them, just as building anything with a performance bias is new to Lexus. If BMW and Mercedes missed the boat in SUV game, Lexus surely missed a different boat with their cars. The SUV is but one component of the market. BMW and MB have to cater to much wider audience than Lexus does all around the world and on that scale Lexus doesn't even begin to compare. Like I said before you view on the market can go either way.

You should be able to sell more if you have more choices to offer. I suspect that too is going to change as Lexus will gradually offer a wider variation of choices in the future. Lexus hadn't been in business for 15 years & they have already done more than anyone expected. I also agree with ljflx that the Lexus RX is car-based and is really a raised ES station wagon(that's why they call it cross over), & trying to seperate RX's sales from the cars' sales in an effort to imply that Lexus can only sell SUV's may not make much sense, although they often lump the RX together with the true truck-based SUV's with real off-road capabilities like the GX & LX."

Toyota's reported net income under the Japanese GAAP is about half of their net income under US GAAP. But going forward from 2003 they will use U.S. GAAP for public reporting.

There hasn't been an operating loss at Toyota in the last decade. These guys are funding their entire automotive operation out of free cash flow.

On the conservative angle, one of the advantages of the way TPS works is that it is an 'inventory-less' manufacturing system. They build to order for their distributors. Their suppliers ship to the build plan. They modulate their build rate to market conditions, which for the last 10 - 12 years has been nothing but increasing unit sales.

Lexus sales figure as compared to MB/BMW will always be hampered to a certain degree in this regard, as a high trim Toyota Avalon/Solara/camry with the ingredient/options to be classified as a luxury car will be counted towards Toyota sales, and a low trim C class/3 series, which in reality does not have higher luxury/content, still counts as MB/BMW sales.This is even more true if you look at world wide sales figures, as many low power/diesel,low trim MB/BMW (which includes cloth seat C class, E class, even S)which are not even offered here in N.America, are sold, many as taxi's, whereas in Japan & Asia, it's mostly the Toyota's(which have no Lexus equivalent)that are used as taxi's.

But I decided I wanted a 4 seater convertible, otherwise I might have picked it, the interior is fantastically executed, and the car is very competent all around. I find the SL overpriced and unnecessarily busy design-wise, way too many character-lines thrown in. But I like 2 door designs because of optics, then I typically don't like ultra-sharp sportiness, because I seldom see the point: there's strict speed limits in CA, the highways are of terrible quality, plus I do own a motorcycle that'll make any sportscar feel uninvolving. Thus, the SC fit the bill reasonably well, perhaps next time out."
3463,"December 15, 2003 4:31PM",bwia,"Footie, apparently the loss refers to Toyota's ""Other business"", which is not delineated.

Here is the relevant reference and link.


Other Business

In fiscal 2002, revenues from other operations fell 31.8%, to ¥728.8 billion, and operating loss contracted from ¥4.6 billion in the previous fiscal year to ¥3.0 billion. The primary cause of this substantial drop in revenues was the elimination of IDO Corporation (now KDDI Corporation) from consolidation in the second half of the previous fiscal year and the transference of Toyota&#146;s industrial equipment and logistics systems operations to Toyota Industries Corporation from fiscal 2002.

Operating loss declined mainly due to the decrease in expenses associated with the development of intelligent transport systems.
In 2001 and 2002 operating losses were ¥4.6 Billion and ¥2.96 Billion yen respectively.

3466,"December 15, 2003 7:54PM",syswei,"Let me try to clear something up. I never suggested that Lexus is a &#147;better&#148; &#147;vehicle&#148; for Merc1 or anyone else simply because Lexus sells more &#147;vehicles&#148;; nor is MB a &#147;better&#148; &#147;car&#148; for myself or anyone else simply because MB sells more &#147;cars&#148;. As I tried to express in my post to Pablo, an individual can have his own ideas as to what vehicle is best for him, based on his own needs, desires, and preferenceswhat I&#146;ll call an &#147;individual&#146;s best vehicle&#148;. What I find valuable in looking at aggregate sales data is that, as I posted before, I think such data &#147;shows which company is doing a better job of meeting real market needs.&#148; Market or aggregate needs, not individual needs.

gscoupe and ljflx,

Your suggestion that we consider the RX to be a car is interesting, but we&#146;re just not going to find any data on how many RX owners considered a wagon vs how many considered a competing SUV. If we knew that we could apportion a certain fraction of RX sales to the SUV side and the rest to the car sidewho knows, maybe Lexus would then beat MB in both cars and SUVs. (Just a possibility, as I said we have no data.)

Merc1,

You wrote, &#147;People will pay for prestige yesthey'll pay for it WHEN THEY CAN. Prestige means nothing when you want a SL500, but can only afford a SC430.&#148; My response is that one of MB&#146;s strengths is its broad product line. You know as well as I do that buyers who can&#146;t afford the SL can and sometimes do buy the CLK. Some of your beloved carmags even put the SC and CLK in the same comparo. And as for the LS and S, you well know, and I have even seen some examples on Edmunds boards, that sometimes LS prospective buyers cross-shop vs the E, not the S. So whether it is the SC430 vs CLK500 cabrio, or LS430 vs E500, there are choices out there for the prestige-loving MB fan that doesn&#146;t have the cash for more car. He isn&#146;t in a situation where he &#147;can only afford a SC430&#148; or LS430.

Your analogy of Porsche/Ferrari vs Lexus/MB is a flawed one because in the Lexus/MB case, MB&#146;s price range fully encompasses Lexus&#146;MB&#146;s low end starts 13% LOWER than Lexus&#146;. Whereas in the Porsche/Ferrari case, Ferrari&#146;s low end price starts 238% HIGHER than Porsche&#146;s."

It might be easy for casual readers here to get the wrong message.

The projections for the current fiscal are around $9bln. I believe there was an extraordinary expense booked in 2002 (year ended 4/30/2002)which may have put them in the red for a quarter in that year but obviously they still made a lot of money on an annual basis.

3470,"December 15, 2003 10:58PM",merc1,"Amazing, you completely ignored everything that was previously posted. Did you even look at the model/price chart? Obviously not. A CLK is not a SL, and everyone that wants a SL does not buy or even want a CLK. Unlike the SC430 which tries unsuccessfully to be a 4-seat (who can sit back there) and a compete with 2-seaters, Mercedes has true 2-seat and true 4-seat convertibles.

You could buy a C320 instead of a S500 too, that isn't the point. The point is where the cars line up, you know the ones that are supposed to be compared. The E-Class and the CLK do compete with the LS and SC, to a degree, especially with the E vs the LS, the LS is clearly ""more"" car for the money. If were to even mention sales of the E-Class compared to the LS430 you bring up price and class in a heartbeat. The cars are in small, medium, and large. C/ES/IS, GS/E, LS/S, the prices are higher for the MB in every case except the base C230 vs the IS300 and ES330. The CLK/SC/SL could all compete, sure.

You're just reaching for things now, but in the end Mercedes' cars still cost a lot more. Buying a different Mercedes still doesn't take away the fact that MB has those higher priced cars. If everyone thought like that nothing above 70K would sell at Mercedes-Benz. They sell EVEN LESS cars overall, which illustrates my point. Price hinders sales.

""MB&#146;s low end starts 13% LOWER than Lexus&#146;.""

When are you going to look at the entire range from Mercedes and Lexus side by side, instead of just the bottom end? Mercedes has at least 8 cars that start above any Lexus, that more than cancels out the 3 models that start below Lexus'. You are flat out ignoring where the bulk of Merceds' cars are priced. The C class is only ONE MODEL RANGE. Look at where the other start/end at. You're pretending those upper end MBs don't exists.

The only market needs Lexus is serving better than Mercedes is the SUV market's needs. In cars they don't offer nearly the choices.

3476,"December 16, 2003 6:38PM",syswei,"I am going to take one last stab at trying to get you to agree on something that flows from elementary economics, and if you don&#146;t get it this time, I will indeed give up. You have said that &#147;People will pay for prestige yes they'll pay for it WHEN THEY CAN&#148;which means that prestige is valuable, and that, other things equal, if one product has more prestige it can command a higher price. PRESTIGE IS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER &#147;FEATURE&#148; OF A PRODUCT, such as larger size, larger engine, better styling, etcinsomuch as people are willing to pay extra for it (which you have admitted).

Suppose there is a housing developer who is building new homes on a large tract of land. Suppose that he offers only two models, &#147;m4&#148; which has 4000 sq ft on 1 acre, and &#147;m5&#148; which has 5000 sf on 1.25 acres. You question customers&#146; ability to pay for the higher-content product, saying that it is impossible to sell in the same quantities if one is priced higher. I submit that if m5 is priced only slightly higher than m4, say 5%, then it will not only sell more units (directly opposite what your theory implies), but it will probably sell MULTIPLE TIMES as many units as m4. Similarly if the developer tries to price too much for the extra content, say 45%, then m4 will outsell m5 by multiple times. If follows that there is a some price premium between 5% and 45% where the two will sell in EQUAL numbers, DESPITE m5 being priced higher. I don&#146;t know if that premium will be 20% or some other number, but the important point is that if a product has higher content, be it size or prestige, it CAN command a significantly higher price and still sell in equal units. Get it?

We can see this principle in operation in the real world. I recall you posting that in some years the S500 outsells the S430. How can this be if your theory is correct, namely that higher priced products have to undersell lower priced ones, even if they offer &#147;more&#148; of something. My answer: that when there is more content, which in this case means larger engine, better standard equipment, more prestige associated with the S500 badging, then as long as that content is priced appropriately the S500 can sell in similar units to the S430. Get it?

Or take another example from the MB world. In some years at least, CLK coupes outsell the C coupes (per autosite.com). And in some years, E sedans outsell C sedans. Not consistent with your theory that higher-content, higher-price products can&#146;t possibly outsell lower-priced products. But consistent with my theory that higher-featured products, if priced appropriately, can sell in the same or even higher quantities. Again, prestige is just like a feature in that people will pay extra for it.

Soooo.your claim that MB&#146;s higher pricing is a unit sales handicap isn&#146;t necessarily so. We all know that MB, across the board, offers more prestige and heritage than Lexus. That is like a feature or content that people will pay extra for. And as long as a product has more content, it can command higher prices and still sell the same number of unitsor higher unitsthan the lower priced competition. So long as the extra content isn&#146;t OVERpriced (like a 25% larger house at a 45% higher price), which you haven&#146;t demonstrated.

You wrote &#147;Price hinders sales&#148; but it should really be &#147;price hinders sales if not accompanied by appropriately higher content.&#148; MB&#146;s higher prestige/heritage constitutes higher content."
3477,"December 16, 2003 7:21PM",pablo_l,"It's basic economics that the price of something is determined by ""perceived value"" to the buyer. End of story.

Prestige adds perceived value to some buyers - we can argue about what percentage of buyers this is, but fact it is the essence of luxury brands to carry price tags that are in absolutely no way related to cost considerations.

Now prestige is a feeble thing, on the other hand, and luxury brands can be run into the ground and lose cache if not managed skillfully or if they simply run out of luck (which is a factor in life and business). It is not easy to engineer a brand, they do take a life of their own image wise and it is impossible to control several of the associations people have with a brand. Theories on that abound. It just happens. In Europe, Mercedes does little for brand management these days other than simply demand a premium over what competitors charge. Whether that will have any repercussions remains to be seen. In the USA, Mercedes seemingly tries to engineer the upscale image a tad bit more, which is probably aided by the fact the US market does not reward ultra-compacts and small displacement engines anyhow - even if they offered them they probably wouldn't sell all that well.

But the Mercedes brand is an interesting study when it comes to mass market psychology."

3480,"December 16, 2003 11:44PM",merc1,"I'm done with the what if scenarios. Lets stick to the cars, where actual, real life data can be used.

Got it. This was clearly shown just recently in the C&D comparo, for 87K (S430), the overwhelming majority of MB buyers would pick a S500, which would give you more for that 87K. Thats the first reason for the S500 outselling the S430, the next would be that once you've reach the point of looking at a 73K car, a 80K one isn't nearly the stretch between a LS430 and a S500, as you try to imply, the cars have a huge base price difference. Only a LS430 Ultra(?) buyer at 71K could think about looking at a 73K S430 or a 80K S500, the buyer looking at the base LS430 at 55K, isn't going to just say, oh the S500 is more prestigous, let me shell out another 25K. To assume everyone can make this kind of leap is pure fantasy. I'm sure there are some LS430 buyers that can afford a Maybach and everything else in between, but the average one can't. Not all S-Class buyers could either. Note: Not saying this the same kind of price leap, just using this for emphasis.

Question: what does any of this have to with Mercedes' sales vs Lexus'? Not much. This has nothing to do with, again what you've ignoring here, that most of Mercedes' cars are still priced higher than Lexus'. What Mercedes models outsells another is completely irrelevant in this conversation.

""Or take another example from the MB world. In some years at least, CLK coupes outsell the C
coupes (per autosite.com). And in some years, E sedans outsell C sedans.""

Lots of things wrong with this. First of all the CLK has 6 models, the C Coupe has only 2, and
try as they might, MBUSA, will never tell you that all C Coupe sells are of the C230 Coupe, I have never, ever seen a C320 Coupe in a lot or on the street. Secondly we're talking about a completely different price range and buyers here. The C Coupe is bought by first-timers to the MB brand, the CLK isn't.

"" Not consistent with your theory that higher-content, higher-price products can&#146;t possibly outsell lower-priced products. But consistent with my theory that higher-featured products, if priced appropriately, can sell in the same or even higher quantities. Again, prestige is just like a feature in that people will pay extra for it.""

You're talking about within the MERCEDES-BENZ lineup, not MERCEDES vs LEXUS. Again, you're reaching for another point that has nothing to do with what you and I have been talking about here. I could have told you the very same things you've posted, within the Mercedes lineup. No news there.

We all know that people are willing to pay for a car for whatever reasons, prestige, performance, whatever, but you've continually missed is they only do this if the CAN DO IT. Your theory misses this by a country mile, you're assuming that everyone can afford to buy whatever they want.....this is so not true. A S500 could be the most critically acclaimed, prestigious car ever made, but unless you have 80K it doesn't matter. A LS430 is much cheaper, by about 25K, and you think that doesn't prevent a car like the S500 from selling more units you're sorely mistaken and clearly not dealing in real world.

""And as long as a product has more content, it can command higher prices and still sell the same number of unitsor higher unitsthan the lower priced competition.""

So I take this as you saying that say a SL500 and a S500 offer more content than a SC430 or a LS430, I could have sworn you were the same person that said these cars didn't even come close to justifying their price premiums over their Lexus competition. You can't have it both ways, they either do or they don't. Since you've admitted that Mercedes either sells as many or outsells Lexus' cars then I guess this statement was wrong from the start:

""And I'm saying that the buying public, on balance, doesn't feel the high prices are worth it...which is why MB isn't number 1 in unit sales.""

Corrected: The only Mercedes that the market doesn't think much of is the ML. They think quite highly of their cars, in fact going by sales numbers, they think of MB's cars higher than Lexus' due to in many cases a whopping price difference not being a factor in MB selling more actual ""cars"" than Lexus does. This is most clearly demostrated by you. You've tried to state that prestige is the big equalling factor here, which it isn't (see above), but lets go along with that for a minute. If thats the case, then all Mercedes is missing is the SUV factor then right? Since their cars outsell Lexus' quite easily in most cases. I've said just that all along, but you in your statement above you said ""MB isn't #1 in unit sales"" implying that entire brand's cars weren't worth the price. You, yourself have proven this not to be true, after I already proved it by pointing MB vs Lexus sales, model line vs model line.

Your initial theory is hugely flawed also because you're not taking into consideration all those models MB has above 70K? Are they not trying to sell those too? Does Lexus even compete past 70K? How could a company that has so many higher priced cars than a competitor, outsell that competitor when that competitor specializes in 30-50K automobiles, when the majority of the more expensive brand's cars are priced over 50K, with some of them over 90K? Look at the price chart given earlier. Again, where do most of MB's models land? How is Mercedes supposed to outsell Lexus when Lexus' biggest sales numbers are produced by their SUV, of which they have three volume SUVs compared to Mercedes' one? Please don't tell me the G-Class is a volume SUV when its projected volume is 1K units yearly, and the ""variant"" of the G is a 95K AMG model.

Nobody is contesting or disputing anything about what people are or are not willing to pay for. I never contested this, you brought this up in an attempt to steer away from your initial theory being wrong. Your whole basis was that Mercedes should have no trouble outselling Lexus, and yet you've yet to even address certain points, only to come up with more ""what if"" questions. Look at the two brands price and model layout on their websites, anyone can see Mercedes in reality has no business even being in a sales race with so many cars priced more than any of their competitors.

M"
3481,"December 16, 2003 11:49PM",merc1,"The CL, SL, and S-Class in particular make even their German competition from BMW and Audi look like bargains, on paper. A loaded A8 or 745Li, and I mean loaded each costs about 80K, right where the S500 starts, yet Mercedes isn't at a sales disadvantage compared to a 55-71K Lexus model? Come on now. Mercedes would sell a ton more cars if they were cheaper. Think about Lexus dropping the price of the SC430 to about 40K, the car would sell a whole lot more than it already does. You can want and lust after the most prestigous cars on the planet, but if you don't have the money you can't get it. You are not taking this into consideration. Your theory is based on price not being a factor between a Mercedes and Lexus, and for the majority of buyers that is simply not the case. Price is one of the biggest things Lexus trades on, when comparing themselves to Mercedes, here you're saying that it doesn't make a difference because a Mercedes is more prestigous. So not true for the bulk of consumers. The LS430 can be had with almost everything the S500 has for 71K compared to about 90K+ for a truly ""loaded"" S500, or as you saw in C&D over 85K for a loaded S430, call it MB being overpriced or whatever, but Mercedes is at a fundamental sales disadvantage here.

ljflx,

As long as you are not trying to imply that Mercedes is the only brand that is bought for prestige sometimes, then there is no issue with that statement from me. I agree that everyone should buy they car they want, otherwise for the money I have to spend I'd get a C230 Sedan and call it a day, but I don't want one.

I know what you're going to say, but I'll ask anyway. I know back in 2001 you looked at the LS430 vs the S430/500 and you bought the LS430. My question is, if the S500 would have been priced closer or nearly the same as the S500 would you have bought the S500 or at least considered it more heavily. I think I know what you're answer will be because of the conversation I'm having with syswei, but I figured its worth a shot. My point is that I know you can afford either, but wasn't the MB knocked for price, in addition to the nav/ride/reliability concerns? Or better yet did the price make the things I remembered you listing as negatives that much harder to overlook????

M"
3482,"December 17, 2003 5:38AM",gscoupe,"I still say MB's disadvantage in prices should be more than offsetted by their much wider model range they offer. There are some models in the MB line up that doesn't even have competitors available not only from Lexus, but other luxury brands as well.Other than the fact that Lexus has yet to introduce coupe versions of their sedans, if one is looking for a V8 powered 4 passenger luxury sports coupe/convertible, where can you go besides Mercedes(Cl & CLK), at least in the past few years? The BMW 6 series coupe/convertible is coming out though, as well as the M version of the new 4 series BMW which I've heard will be a V8 ,and I suspect there will be more competition coming from other brands as well in the coming years.

BTW, I think the BMW 6 series is the best looking Bangle design yet. I don't know if it'll appeal to everyone, but at least not nearly as hideous as the Z4."
3483,"December 17, 2003 6:56AM",footie,"With 75% of these high end cars being 'leased', isn't the lease price the issue for most shoppers?

I know quite a few folks that have acquired a BMW, Lex or MB in the last few years. Most of them call their accountant or financial advisor and say ""Hey, I am going car shopping for new Merc or whatever, should I lease or buy? Next questions has to do with source of funds...""

If so, then another big factor here besides prestige and heritage and 0-60 times, is the resale value and the amount of manufacturer's support.

Cars like MB's and Lex carry pretty good residuals, while BMW tends to be less and Audi/Jag are in the tank. Also, Lex has good money factors from TFS and MB is getting more agressive from MBCC since their inventories have risen here.

Take an 80K car with a 60% residual - you pay for 32K worth of depreciation 56K average loan with nothing down.

Take a 70K car with 50% residual - you pay for 35K depreciation and 51K average loan.

Depending money factors the difference can be very small.

So I don't get the Encyclopedia class discussions on this issue. It ain't about price. It's about deal and cash flow."
3484,"December 17, 2003 8:17AM",gscoupe,"You are correct. For those who lease their cars, Mercedes' higher prices may not be a significant disadvantage at all."
3485,"December 17, 2003 8:51AM",ljflx,"It's still a money factor. In 2001 the S500 would have cost me $375+/- per month more than the LS430. That still works out to be about $13,500 pre-tax and 8,500 post tax differential on a three year lease. If you continue to lease for 6 years or so that's equal to or greater than the price difference in the first place. If you want to spend that money you save on the cost differential you can buy a houseful of electronics or a few nice plasma TV's. I just added a Samsung DLP TV which was about equal to the third year of lease savings I had.

I always tend to lease because I like a new car and the latest stuff every three years. But as well I find it very difficult to justify a purchase financially - on the cars in this arena. Lower end cars are a different story. I just worked a GX deal at $745 per month with 0 down. I could have bought it but using a 3.5% return on the money I would have laid out over three years upfront (and same on 3 years of lease payments) the price worked out to be $250 cheaper if I lease and buy at lease end (including the lease fee of $500) rather than buy upfront. In 2001 with interest rates a bit higher it was about $1,000 more to lease my LS430 than buy upfront (half of that was the lease fee). So why buy when you can try out the car for three years and decide later and either save some money or spend a tad more. If you decide to buy at lease end and pay a tad more consider it an insurance policy on getting a quality car that pleases you.

Merc1 - I think our HR handbook is shorter than your last two posts. As for prestige - people buy certain things to impress others rather then themselves. It happens most often with what is seen as the highest price commodity - MB, Rolex etc. But it spreads out very well to the BMW's, Jags, Lexus etc. of the world as well."
3486,"December 17, 2003 9:18AM",bluestar1,"In Oct 1998 I bought my '99 LS400 with the premium pkg (HID, heated seats, NAV). OTD price was ~$60K. Could I have bought an S-class ? Didn't think I want to shell out that much extra cash for a 3-star prestige. I got a fully loaded luxury sedan for $15k LESS than the comparable (by my standards) MB. OK I couldn't afford the S-class. Does that make you feel better, Merc1 ?

What irritates me slightly is having someone who does not have an MB (probably cannot afford 99% of them) talk so authoritatively and berate others who, at least, put their money where their mouth is. Someday, Merc1, you will finally own an MB, and we can all rest in peace ! Sorry to make this personal, but these long-winded diatribes gotta end somehow."
3487,"December 17, 2003 10:21AM",footie,"With 75% of these high end cars being 'leased', isn't the lease price the issue for most shoppers?

I know quite a few folks that have acquired a BMW, Lex or MB in the last few years. Most of them call their accountant or financial advisor and say ""Hey, I am going car shopping for new Merc or whatever, should I lease or buy? Next questions has to do with source of funds...""

If so, then another big factor here besides prestige and heritage and 0-60 times, is the resale value and the amount of manufacturer's support.

Cars like MB's and Lex carry pretty good residuals, while BMW tends to be less and Audi/Jag are in the tank. Also, Lex has good money factors from TFS and MB is getting more agressive from MBCC since their inventories have risen here.

Take an 80K car with a 60% residual - you pay for 32K worth of depreciation 56K average loan with nothing down.

Take a 70K car with 50% residual - you pay for 35K depreciation and 51K average loan.

Depending money factors the difference can be very small.

So I don't get the Encyclopedia class discussions on this issue. It ain't about price. It's about deal and cash flow."
3488,"December 17, 2003 10:35AM",pablo_l,"It is about price. That is indisputable. Even people will a lot of money to burn try to spend it smartly. Smart shopping does not stop because people have enough money to buy whatever they please. That is a very flawed assumption.

The leasing difference is not small. Go to the respective websites and give it a try: leasing comparatively equipped S430 or LS430 turns out to be $1458 vs $989. Quite significant. You also have someone who looked into both talking about about $375 a month. So it *is* a very real money issue, and one's got to decide whether the star is worth the costly premium. Some say yes, some say no.

Mercedes recipe for success going forward is obviously to keep as many people as possible going for the premium, while the competitors will make that as tough as decision as possible."

With cars, I did go through an escalation exercise until I found out I am not that much into prestige, but rather into what happens to entertain me. I discovered that, somewhat tragically, with my Jag XJR ownership experience. Great car, but bad fit for me for a number of reasons. The fact I opted for a 9-3 convertible for most of my car driving speaks volumes. I do not need for everybody to see what I can and can not afford. But I do have a brand snob in me, and thus I did get a near new car, but I did it i used condition - there's no way on earth I could justify blowing $100k on a car given my current post-bubble income. I do run my budget like a business - I manage it to be profitable at year end. In the meantime, we have added a Mini S to the car stable, and it is a total blast. For all of $25k I am having a great time.

My wife is different, and a bit like my mother -Freud would be proud- in her car brand preferences. Rationally, she thinks many cars are very neat. But she will go Merc brand every time, even when she shies away from blowing the money on the more expensive offerings (I am happy about that).

I should also point out that I think the Merc CL is *the* car. I would get it, I could get it, but I prefer to wait until the day where I truly feel I have ""arrived"" until I celebrate with treating myself to a new CL.

3495,"December 18, 2003 6:30AM",gscoupe,"While I agree that to some buyers,they can only buy the car that they can afford. However, when it comes to high end luxury cars, where it's also a status symbol & a means to show off, some buyers will tend to pick the car with the higher price tag regardless of whether he/she think it's worth it. They want their neighbors & relatives to know that they can afford a $80K+ car rather than a $60K car. So at the higher end, higher pricing may actually not be a disadvantage at all to some buyers.In other words, they don't really care what they are getting as long as it's expensive.You can't automatically assume that most car buyers are very knowledgeable about cars & are wise, prudent & rational in their purchase decisions.I've personally known people like that, some among my relatives. There are a good portion of luxury car buyers that are silverspooners that can't fully appreciate the value of money.

I've also heard that some buyers can justify paying more for a Mercedes or a BMW rather than a comparable Lexus or Infiniti because they can end up losing the same among or even less in depreciation over the period of ownership despite the higher price tag.This is definitely true for some Mercedes & BMW models because of their heritage & name.

To claim that higher price will hinder sales, while true in some cases, is a way too simplistic way of looking at it, as there are many other factors involved as well."

if the XJR wasn't for me, you can rest assured a more vanilla sedan like the ES is not going to set my world on fire, either. The only candidate is the SC430, as I explained earlier. It is not that I have a bias against Lexus as a brand, by the way - I am fully aware and have always stated their cars are phenomenally engineered.

gscoupe -

I agree with everything you say, but the key is to not start lumping the majority of buyers of any brands into certain categories, as some have done. Certainly not every Mercedes buyers is irrational, nor is every Lexus buyer rational. And if with luxury cars it was just a matter of raising the price to maximize appeal, you'd have all these cars being sold at over $200k. But oddly enough, the over $100k market seems to stay constant in units, and it seems more offerings -as have become available recently- do not increase sales at all, a sure indication the super-rich as a rule do never spend what they *can*, but rather that they are governed by fiscal self-discipline. Due to my job, I work with many multi-millionaires (tragically, I am not one myself and the vast majority of them is rather spartan in their car buying habits."

Those that inherit are more wreckless whereas those who earned it will value it greatly."
3498,"December 18, 2003 12:06PM",gscoupe,"I agree with you that we shouldn't lump buyers into broad categories, like suggesting that Mercedes aren't selling more cars because buyers who don't buy Mercedes can't afford them. Besides,pricing alone don't dictate everything.I bought an Infiniti G35 coupe which is $10K less than a comparable BMW 330ci, but given that BMW is the brand with the highest resale value in Canada, especially the hot selling & highly reputable 3 series, plus the free service, I never believe I'm saving any significant amount of money, if at all, by going with the Infinti. So price isn't an issue at all in my decision. It's the fact that the Infiniti is the fresher hot looking car with comparable fun & performance to the 3 series,and is not as commonly seen on the road as a Honda that made the decision for me.I think nothing less of the 3 series because it's a great car. I picked the G35 coupe because the Infiniti is more desirable for me at this point in time."
3499,"December 18, 2003 3:01PM",mfullmer,"...am I seeing a common thread that the Lexus (lets say the LS430) is much more exclusive the the MB?

Everywhere I go I see S-Class of some nomenclature. Every type of person driving them. I also know 6 people who have '01-'04 S classes (ok, 3 of those have traded them in on more ""exclusive"" cars - 2 LSs and one Q45).

I don't see the LS430 everywhere and the person behind the wheel, when I do see one, is someone with whom I can relate.

So, I guess for exclusivity, the LS430 wins, hands down.

Of course MB RAISED their prices for '04, with no real updates. What are they thinking? Oh, yes, I know. Those ""look-at-what-I'm-driving"" types will pay that price for a sub-standard vehicle without question before they will be buy some piece of ""[offensive geographical slur ommitted]-crap""."

None of whom are breaking any sales records YTD, at least against the competition. No one remembers the Sentra even exists; the redesigned Corolla pretty much squashed that one out.

In the luxury class, the M, Q, and QX combined do not register a blimp on the car sales chart. Duds, I call them. Here, as with Nissan, only two models are doing well - the G and the FX.

In the truck/SUV class, their two new entrants - Titan and Armada - are way too new to judge. Only time will tell if Nissan entered the ring too late, or came to the party loaded and ready to take on the challenge of the big boys from Ford, GM and Toyota. We'll see. The Pathfinder has pretty much disappeared. Sad to see a good car go.

Nissan/Infiniti has a long road ahead, while they have made some good strides, the market has told them they have a ways to go yet. They are a very distant competition in the lux class, barely registering on the richter scale of luxury sedans/trucks."

 I'm not surprised that affluent people that works with financial experts like ljflx are usually prudent with their finances. But believe me, there are many rich people who don't know or don't care to manage their finances and are excessive reckless spenders.

Ditto for the lower priced luxury cars - primarily from a stature standpoint. Found money (whether inherited or made in a stock bubble or made by celebs where stature is part of the job) will always be spent more wrecklessly than earned money regardless of whether you are talking about cars, jewelry or expensive electronics. All of the multi-millionaires I know earned their money. Do they spend it? Sure. One guy I know very well - who drives an old MB SEL, and a new LS430 - has had his home featured in Architectual Digest. He moved to Lexus from MB because he believes they build cars the way MB used to. I agree with him. His worth is well over $100mln.

If that was the case, they'd bypass the S-class and go even more exotic, wouldn't they, and *really* show off what they can spend. They don't. Thus the logic is flawed, and that can be proven with actual sales data in hand: price does play a very significant role in every car segment except for the true exotics.

And you're still neglecting what many MB & BMW salesman had been saying to their potential customers, that their initial seemingly higher price, could be cancelled out by the expected higher resale on many of their models, plus you get free maintainence service over the warranty period, so at the end of the period of ownership, it's a wash,your real cost of ownership which matter most,isn't higher, plus you get the Mercedes or BMW logo.There is no flawed logic here.BTW, one of the reason the Infiniti Q45 isn't selling despite their lower price is that their resale value sucks, & that it's real cost of ownership isn't lower (or even worse)than it's more expensive competitors"

The resale stuff... then why is the MB's leasing cost $400+ higher than Lexus'? Depreciation figures highly into leasing costs, and yet... anyone making even very good money *will* care about spending an additional $400 a month, I guarantee that. It's just about the perceived value that $400 buys.

The price *is* an issue for many buyers, even with these cars. It is not the only issue, nor does it mean they couldn't wing the higher priced car if they really wanted to - they chose not to for a number of reasons, including price. Would more people chose the MB if the price were lower? Well, it isn't, and thus it's immaterial to speculate about it. The fact is Merc can afford to demand a premium, and it works for them.

Again, it's perceived value. Some people think the MB brand justifies the premium, some think it doesn't, and some simply don't want to pay the additional money - there are a lot of motivations out there, and to lump things into any generic statement does indeed miss the mark."

Permit me to jump in here.

I just returned from lunch with a colleague. Here is an example of someone who agreed with that premise. But here is the reality of her experience.

In Sept. my colleague's wife bought an '03 E320. That car has seen more of the inside of the repair shop than on the road. In 3 months, with only 1,000 miles, it spends most of its days in the shop. Here are the problems. Currently, it's now 17 days in the shop.

Electrical (what else is new !). The car won't start in the morning, bcos the smart key and the ecu can't agree that the owner want to drive the car off the carport/garage. After sometime waiting in the car, she puts in a second and third attempt, and the car still won't start, making some whirring noise under the hood. MB technicians come over, get the car started and towed to the shop. To duplicate the problem = 3 days. Once a solution is deviced, it takes another 3 days just to be able to test it on the car, bcos that's how long it takes to get the car started.

The wife has filed for lemon law protection, and waiting to hear on this. She is very disappointed and quite upset, really that MB will complicate an otherwise excellent car, with such electronic gadgetry that confuses instead of improving the driving experience of such a lux car. Oh, she paid a mere $55K OTD in Sept on the 2003 E320.

I guess we have people who aspire to buy these super-lux cars, only if they knew what they'd be buying. That free mainatainance on the warranty ! You'll need every day of it. I am glad I don't own one of these lemon MB's. Judging by the list of owners with similar problems, MB is in for a long hard time in the future."
3516,"December 19, 2003 2:22PM",sv7887,"Hi all,

   I think all this talk of MB's demise is being overstated. It simply appears Mercedes is having some issues of late. Given their long history, I'm sure they'll be able to recover. A company like MB won't just cease to be a competitor. Cars like the SL500 indicate that they are still very capable of producing an unbeatable world class car.

    I've said this many times: I see a trend in the luxury carmakers to cram their cars full of electronics. Is there really any purpose for parking radar and all these other useless gimmicks? Like anything, the more complicated the design, the more problems you are going to face.

I think Jaguar has done the best job of making sure the new age toys aren't too intrusive. I'd pit Lexus second, only b/c I have to switch on the Touchscreen to access my climate control settings. Being greeted with ""The Lexus Link System is Active"" every morning in my LS430 is driving me nuts. Maybe I'm too much of a purist, but I really think this electronics rage is going too far.

As for the MB vs Lexus debate. We've all argued to no end that Lexus builds a superb car. The only legitimate complaint that the MB camp may have is the insipid designs they've been turning out as of late. I was given a brand new ES330 for a loaner..Fantastic car inside, and drove beautifully. But the exterior design provokes nothing more than a Yawn. There is absolutely nothing engaging about it whatsoever. I'm anxious to see the what the 2006 LS looks like. If it's another S Class clone, I'll be terribly disappointed.

3517,"December 19, 2003 5:04PM",footie,"This sure sounds like Mercedes dodgeball 101 that a friend of mine who was a MB Salesperson here in Boston was 'indoctrinated' with at their store.

IMHO: Mercedes problems are many and they are not 'just having some issues' nor does the 'all cars these days are full of electronics which are complicated' argument pass the common sense test given that Lexus can build the same advanced technology and integrate it.

Plus most of the 'advanced technolog' these days is coming from innovations in the supplier base not from the car companies. Manufacturers that work with their suppliers and still can't get technology to integrate and work properly in their cars are being poorly managed and have the wrong priorities. There are NO excuses.

Mercedes incidence of failure, defect levels and dissatisfied customers is the HIGHEST in the industry amongst luxury brands per JDP. It's a trend that has been underway for over a decade.

I think that the Mercedes business approach to putting brand management before customer satisfaction is self correcting."
3518,"December 19, 2003 5:57PM",gscoupe,"Sometimes, I'm wondering whether you are completely following what we are talking about in the recent discussions.Mercedes competes with Lexus & other lux brands for sales way lower than $100K for probably at least 90 % of the cars they sell. You keep harping on the extreme end case of $400 per month more for a S500 vs. a LS430,whereas the vast majority of the competition occurs at a much lower price difference, & I thought it was you who said we shouldn't pick one case or one factor & broadly apply it to all cases. LOL !! Yes, & people do cross shop between a LS430 & a E500, & unlike some Lexus fans here, I do think there are legitimate & justifiable reasons why a person would pick a E500 over a LS430. I do think the LS430 is more car & a ""better"" car overall. But, it's no good for a person who has $55 to $70K to spend who want a smaller, sportier sedan and don't care about reliability because it's not intended for daily transportation."
3519,"December 19, 2003 6:01PM",ljflx,"are deeper than most want to believe. Today I took delivery of my GX470. As I went out to the huge garage - that looks like a place where Boeing would assemble planes - I encountered a couple looking at the GX I was taking. The couple was finalizing an order on a GX with the same color combo I took (or I should say my wife took as I still prefer the LX - but this GX is awfully nice, I must admit) and wanted to be sure they liked it in that combo. The guy asked me about what led me to the GX and as it turned out he was coming out of an ML350 that gave him a lot of problems including various automotive ones. He said he had been buying MB for 20 years but when his E lease expired a few years back he switched over to the GS and went from a problem car to a perfect one and now was expecting the same from the move from the ML to the GX.

We hear all these accolades about big powerful engines and how the auto rags love performance but in the end if cars this expensive don't function as close to perfection as possible than the experience is a disappointment and all that bragging for a tiny fraction of performance cars is irrelevant. This guy told me the last great car MB built was the old S-class. He's an engineer and fully appreciated the great things MB has done in the past, but in his words the game is electronics now and in that regard the Germans are way behind the Japanese. The problem is MB needs to stay number 1 and to do so they need to lead in an arena where they are trumped. I think the reliability problems will deepen and as they do the brand image will suffer more and more."

3521,"December 19, 2003 6:54PM",ljflx,The problem with that is the LS430 is much more comparable to the S-500 in power. They are about equal with probably a nod to the LS430 - forget the horsepower figures - and deliver the quick acceleration and torque power you'd expect at these price points. I was initially looking at the S-430 and moved away from it right away because it felt underpowered. The S-500 is a much better car than the S-430 (to me at least) and is the real comparable to the LS430. It is the embodiment of the S-class to me. On pricing the S-430 was about $180 more per month than the LS430 in 2001 and only about $200 cheaper than an S-500. You could take your argument and say for a $200 a month difference why would anyone buy an S-430 instead of an S-500. Yet more S-430's are sold than S-500's.

3524,"December 19, 2003 7:55PM",pablo_l,"Your point now is confused. Either you claim the cost of ownership is the same and thus the brand doesn't matter (a point which is indeed inaccurate), or it isn't. You're trying to state both at your convenience.

And the key point is that even people who *could* wing either purchase *do* decide to save themselves the additional money - because they don't see the added value, *and/or* because they like to keep $20k in their pocket and vacation for 2 weeks at the Grand Wailea on Maui.

Again, to claim people don't care whether they spend $60k or $75k is somewhat silly. It's perceived value, and the motivations are highly personal. Doesn't make one car ""better"" than the other, or one buyer dumber than the other.

Mattox -

as to luxury buyers don't wanting maintenance hassles, I don't know, Bentley or Rolls or Ferrari would have gone out of business eons ago if that was the case. Different people expect different things, and some people are very willing to put up with idiosynchrasies.

Finally, I doubt any experience that winds up calling for leman law is a ""typical"" Mercedes experience. Sure they have lemons, but it's *not* the typical scenario. That's an exaggeration that does not realistically reflect whatever quality issues MB might have had.

Also, my wife uncle's LX470 has been trouble ridden, too. In 6 months, it's been in the shop far more often and longer than my wife's '99 ML320 (which has been utterly problem free despite the M's reputation, never been in the shop for anything except maintenance). None of these experiences actually prove much - it's all highly circumstancial stuff."
3525,"December 19, 2003 8:14PM",dwongswong,"I've been reading about many arguments to what car is the best (Mercedes, Lexus, BMW, etc.). I like to put in my two-cents. When I buy a car, these are my criteria (in order of most important to least) for what car I will choose:
1. price (most important to me because I can't pay cash for a car--at least not yet)
2. exterior styling (it has to catch my eyes because I'm the one who has to look at it everyday)
3. interior ergonomics (I have to sit in it everyday, so it must be comfortable, good to look at, easy to use, and great fit and finish)
4. reliability (if it's in the shop a lot, what's the use of paying so much money for one)
5. fun to drive (does it have enough horsepower, do I like the way it handles, is it quiet, does it shift smoothly, does it make my commute not feel like I'm in hell)
6. service (good service from the time of the sell, easy to make appointments to bring my car in for routine maintenances, good loaner cars, having my car ready and clean when they say it will be finished, and if it needs to be fixed, it will be fixed right the first time)
7. resale value (it doesn't take a hit if I want to sell it)

I did not put prestige because only what I think is good about the car matters, not what others think. Too many people buy things to show off--that's a shame, because if you ever are down on your luck, will those people ever look at you the same? I also think that if a car is beautiful to you, then that's all that matters, because looks are subjective.

3526,"December 19, 2003 8:29PM",sv7887,"Footie,
As a Lexus owner myself, I certainly can understand your point of view. Lexus has done a great job of integrating all these new electronic toys into their cars. My complaint was more along the lines of ""These electronic toys are getting too intrusive"" I keep my old 92 LS just to get away from all of it. Some advances such as the Nav system are welcome, but I never really had much use for the parking radar and laser guided cruise control. Maybe it's just me, but I feel all this electronic gadgetry distracts from the driving experience.

I still think reports of MB's demise are far too premature. MB has its' problems no doubt. But you can't discount their 100+ yr history. If anyone is capable of turning things around it's MB. I recognize the surveys you've presented, and agree that they're in a rut. Give them a few years and I'm sure they'll work something out. Lexus needs to take full advantage of MB's downturn and release more performance orientated cars to steal some more market share. The new concepts posted on this forum are very exciting and I hope Lexus will put them into production.

I hope do you realize that Merc will launch into one of his long diatribes over your posting. LOL.

3527,"December 19, 2003 8:57PM",gscoupe,"My point isn't confused, maybe it was you that are confused at what I'm trying to convey.That's why I said I'm wondering whether you really follow what we're discussing about. I never said nor imply that the brand doesn't matter(that's an individual preference),just that the cost of ownership could be the same in many cases, not the extreme & unfair comparison at the highest end that the 2 brands are competing between a S500 & a LS430 you try to quote lfjx. Again, you are still trying to use one case or one set of consumer behaviour that support your case, and broadly apply it to all consumers at all price ranges, exactly the same thing you suggest that we shouldn't do in an earlier post.
Some people will try to save money, others will want to get the more expensive brand for status & bragging rights.
I never said nor imply it makes no difference between spending $60K and $75k, again putting words in my mouth. What I'm saying is you are not really spending the extra $15K if you can resell the more expensive car for $15K more after ownership period. Even if you can resell it for only $10K more, you factor in the free scheduled maintainence that MB (& BMW)offers, the real price difference becomes very minimal, not nearly as important as you and some others are trying to imply. We all know that Mercedes is the brand name with the top resale value in the US all along until the recent article ljflx mentioned that suggest MB's future projected resale values will fall out of the top 5 ? Thus suggesting price alone is an important factor that Mercedes shouldn't be selling more makes no sense to me.Price is only one of many factors that has an impact on sales. MB , Lexus & others do compete in selling at least 90 % of their cars at an overlapping price range.

Discussing here in the past couple days reminds me of why I've been reading this board for a year, & have resisted joining until recently.

I have no specific insight into the LX470 issues other than the complaints of my wife's uncle, because I don't give a hoot and have no interest in what the issues are. I never have felt like making conversation out of something that seems to upset the other person, and since the LX470 is not a car I'd get, I have little interest in researching it.

3532,"December 20, 2003 7:25AM",ljflx,"Your point is purely theoretical and only works in percentages anyway and not in real dollars. It doesn't happen that way in the real world. For an $85k MB S-500 to work out to an equal cost to a $70k LS430 the S-500 would have to hold 8-10 percentage points higher in residual than the LS430 after 3-5 years. If this was the case and interest payments were equal than the lease payments or cost to own would be the same. But its not. They both hold about the same residual percentage after 3-5 years and and in fact the S-class is actually lower based on that WSJ article. In 2001 the S-class leases I was being offered had a 1-2% higher residual built in than the LS after 3 years but those residuals didn't hold up in the real world. On top of that the lease money factor was 1+% higher and offset just about all of the higher residual percentage in the lease anyway. So whoever financed MB leases in 2001 would have been hurt at lease end on the residual though the higher interest rate taken earlier would have pretty much equalled the score.

Leasing has many factors - not just residuals. In 2001 Japanese interest rates were 3-4% lower than European rates. Toyota (and any Jaoanese brand) could haver undercut the whole market but they didn't.

The days of MB holding the high residuals it did in the past are long over. Twenty years ago MB made the best buillt and safest cars that had the highest reliability ratings. But now there is too much competition and they couldn't hold up those qualities, They are still living off that past reputation but it is less and less an influence each year. This doesn't mean they don't build excellent cars. It just means the field has caught up to them and in some cases has surpassed them. Long-term car residuals are held up by high quality reliable cars not by brand names."
3533,"December 20, 2003 9:09AM",footie,"Right now, leases on LS430's from TFS have 56% residuals for three years and a money factor of .0018 ( about 4.3% ).

3536,"December 20, 2003 6:32PM",pablo_l,"When I moved to the USA in late '95, a Lexus and an Infiniti were the first cars I got -one for me, one of my ex girlfriend- based on the reputation for reliability. I was getting grounded in a new environment, and the last thing I wanted was car trouble. Neither the SC400 nor the M30 convertible lived up to the reputation for utter reliability, after my ex and I broke up -and she moved back to Europe- I decided to trade them both in an simply go for more passion, since the cars had been acting up anyhow. I got an XJS. The SC went through 4 batteries for reasons unknown, and had paint fade all over the back of the car, and the M30 had ridiculous convertible top issues. Both service departments were excellent, and despite the spotty track record of both cars I don't hold the experience I had against the brands, but merely to bad luck, and who knows what my ex had done to the Infiniti top, she was not what you'd call a caring owner. I haven't brought up either experience up in this thread because I believe it is merely circumstancial and meaningless stuff, but since you feel like doubting my credibility, there it goes. Anyone that does a search for my user id on this web site will find allusion to both ownership experiences -without any brand bitterness- throughout my years on these boards.

I'll also freely admit to feeling downright antipathy for the MB brand until my wife wanted the ML badly in the post-Jurassic Park marketing craze, when the ML became *the* car to have for a while. Despite my expectations, the car has proven to be a total darling, which comes to show how much you can trust brand perception stuff.

That is why I don't believe at all in going by reputation that others repeat at nauseam when it comes to car purchases: as a rule, when I have done that, I have been underwhelmed. Bad luck. And the cars I had the lowest reliability expectations for -the XJS convertible and the ML- proved to be utter darlings that didn't have one single issue other than going in for maintenance intervals.

Oh, just to ridicule your doubts about the authenticity of my claim, I offer this forum to post a picture of my wife uncle's LX470 and his wife's Jaguar XKR, parked side by side in their house, by the end of the day tomorrow on my web site.

And I have heard him complain about it. That's all. He had an LS400 previously, and was a vocal Lexus advocate. Oh, and his wife had an SC400, so they were an all Lexus household for a while, but she went Jag. None of this means he won't buy a Lexus again, nor is it meant to remotely indicate that Lexus is not a desirable car brand. All it means is that everybody is mortal, and if you look closely enough all brands will have occasional issues - the key to the luxury buyer is how they deal with it. It is utterly unrealistic to expect that any complex engineering device will always be utterly and totally flawless every time. Eventually statistics will bite one of us."
3539,"December 21, 2003 8:56PM",blockislandguy,"Footie, nice post. Does it mean that there is really no significant difference in residuals (I calculate a spread of .035 or so) and money factors?? If, so can we agree that the total ownership cost is about the same?"
3540,"December 21, 2003 10:05PM",footie,"blockislandguy

I don't know what the '.035 spread' you refer to means.

Here's my math on a hypothetical example.

The residual % is applied to the MSRP in most leases.

In the case of a 65K Lexus LS430 (well equipped but not maxed) that 56% would be $36.4K. Depreciation would be $28.6.

A comparable S430 would be MSRP'd around $78K (I think)

So it would have a residual of $42,120 and depreciation of $35,880.

Independent of money factors, depreciation on the Benz would be $208 / month higher over 36 months.

If you do the math on the money factors and assume cap cost at MSRP deals for both cars ( not likely, particularly in the case of the Lex ), the net lease difference favors the Lex by $316 / month pre tax - about $11.3K lower than the Benz."

3542,"December 22, 2003 10:56AM",ljflx,"In an in-depth news story in yesterday's NY Times Jergen Schremp stated the reasons for the merger/acquisition (let the courts decide what it was) with Chrys;er. He pretty much said the MB business model was not sustainable long-term. The cost to deploy new technologies, and the quickening pace of new model development for both established lines and new lines were too costly for MB to maintain its profit margins because it sold only 800,000-1,000,000 cars a year. Thus he needed to spread these costs across many millions of cars the way the larger mass producers do. He mentioned the entrance of Toyota, Honda and Nissan into the space as cause for concern. Interestingly he didn't mention BMW (at least not that I saw - it was a long story and I didn't read all of it) and talked about Audi as if they were only about to enter the luxury space. Translation - more and more cross sharing of platforms and parts and luxury equipment is a must. I've always said it was pure business common sense to understand this deal. The success of the Japanese transcended the lux cars across the whole spectrum and resulted in a lower unit production cost for luxury vehicles that has forever changed the luxury landscape. It's not a cast system anymore. The brands need to spread costs amongst non-luxury models to maintain profits and higher margins. This is not me talking but the CEO of Mercedes stating why the Chrysler deal was a necessity.

I do think BMW has to make a move soon. It seems logical that they do something with GM but GM also has a deep relationshio with Toyota. We'll see.

Hey - we've been at this another year. I enjoy it despite our difference of opinions. Have a great (and safe) holiday."
3543,"December 22, 2003 6:28PM",pablo_l,"Well, MBA logic in hand, unless you show a path to double digit growth you shouldn't be in business. Germany on the other hand is full of semi-private companies that don't grow all that much and yet still manage to be international benchmarks. BMW has grown through its spurts and stumbles, and will continue to do so as long as the Quandt family hold the majority. Porsche is another example of a company that doesn't necessarily have to produce millions of cars to be a player (albeit even they can't afford to be merely a sports-coupe play to be ""viable"").

I think being a slave to growth is a disease. Some companies cna be managed to be extremely healthy without much growth."
3544,"December 22, 2003 8:10PM",ljflx,"The feeling I got reading this story was that it wasn't a deal done for growth. It was about maintaining current margins long-term and about survival. Clearly he sees Cadillac and GM coming back and Ford has revitalized Jaguar. Nissan is on an upswing and Honda has gotten stronger. Toyota is super-strong and probably one he fears greatly. He is playing a master game of chess and you don't win or stay competitive if you play too conservative. The man said his profit margins were not sustainable without this merger. That is saying alot.

But having my own business with two other partners - which I am spending more and more time with - I know exactly what you mean. I don't have to make our financials public and we have a well positioned business with a great niche and excellent profits. If they decline 5-10% I don't have to explain it to anyone and we are still very healthy. But Im also playing under the radar screen of the big guys in our industry. I don't think BMW is anymore whereas Porsche and others still are."
3545,"December 22, 2003 11:53PM",merc1,"Well I don't doubt that Mercedes needed to spread costs out over a broader base, after all Mercedes has been at the forefront of new technology and innovation since, well since forever, so I agree with that. Toyota and GM are the ones that should be feared, they have the biggest pockets, though GM is still years behind in overall luxury car execution compared to Toyota. I guess I'm not as worried about GM because while they are selling a lot of cars and trucks they still have to use a pile of incentives to do so, Toyota doesn't. Cadillac's comeback will have run it's course in a 2-3 more years, and then what will be the question.

My problem Daimler-Benz is that they picked one of the weakest companies around to merge with or takeover (let the court decide which). Daimler-Benz was in great shape before 1998. I still want to believe they could have made it with Smart and maybe one other brand to spread costs out over, not needing the entire Chrysler group of troubled brands. I just don't see this merger working. It's going to kill Mercedes-Benz the day they attempt to sell a co-engineered platform under a Mercedes-Benz product.

Now BMW and Porsche are the just about the last two remaining ""independent"" smaller car companies on earth, along with Honda. I'm wondering how BMW stays in such great shape yet their ""business model"" is very similar to Mercedes'. Porsche saved themselves for a while longer with the Cayenne. I don't see BMW ever doing anything with GM, it will surely be the passing of BMW if that ever happens. GM is about the most clueless company around when it comes to managing their foreign brands. They're already using Chevys and Subarus for future Saab products. Better to let BMW die before something like that happens, and Saab too for that matter. Yes I believe in protecting brand uniqueness just that strongly. I see Porsche being bought up by DCX, but under the control of their across-the-street neighbor, Mercedes-Benz, now that would be some union. I want Chrysler to be spun off before its too late. Something tells me that this will happen if the next big round of new Chrysler doesn't change things. Mercedes-Benz can't continue to support all of DCX.

Audi's model is so similar to the Japanese one so they're probably in the best postion. The have all of VW, which sells millions of cars, to spread costs around. Not to mention Skoda, Bentley, Seat, and Lamborghini.

Jaguar will never be a threat to MB or BMW overall because Jaguar was never designed to be a volume brand, and Ford surely isn't going to spend the money to do that. Plus I seriously doubt people will ever buy Jaguars on the scale they do MB and BMWs, their style is not for everyone. Though they are gorgeous cars to me.

3556,"December 29, 2003 11:46AM",ljflx,Nice story in today's NY Times detailing the SL history and values of the older cars today. Some of the originals can be worth $350k+ if they are in top codition. Apparently MB only made 1600 SL's in the first three years. Original cost was about $6500.
3557,"January 4, 2004 9:40PM",i_drive,"mercedes should stop producing soooooo many new models. jesus! it seems as though every week, poop! out comes a new mb model out of Germany. Has anyone seen the ""MST"" Rumor on germancarfans.com? They say MB is planning on rolling out a new ""sport"" crossover, which is more SUV than the GST. It seriously looks like a Nissan Murano.

Lately, I've been disapointed with the direction MB, not BMW, is heading towards. Have any of you been to the LA Auto Show? Stop by the new 2005 CLS-Vision on display. I could have sworn it wasy designed by Honda or another Japanese company. The front: looks like a Q45 (which isn't repsectable at all in my opinion), and the rear: not typical of a german car. I really don't understand why so many people find the CLS to be more gorgeous than the new 645Ci (according to autospies, and other websites).

I think Mercedes-Benz should spend more time on what they already have, and try to beef up quality and design, rather than build so many new designs, and have them suffer from quality issues and complaints.

contrary to Audi, which in my opinion, has one of the best quality and design (even compared to Lexus). I was really impressed with the whole, intire line, partic. the new A8L. That baby is drop-dead gorgeous.

As usual, the LS430 ultra-lux brought a lot of people around it, and i overheard a couple of people who said the LS430 had better value than the S430/S500. But i don't want to get into that issue...

I'm really starting to get disapointed with Mercedes-Benz lately. They better shape up, because if they don't, i'm shipping out.

2002 S430
approx. $15,000 worth of repairs and damages since 2002
gives me grief every day

1999 ML320
""Check-Engine"" light for the past year; MB can't fix it
Rattling noises everywhere in the cabin
Both bumpers ""fell"" off during machine-car wash.

1998 ML320 ""original batch""
too many to list; MB replaced it with new '99 ML320"

I've been on vacation for almost 2 weeks, I didn't even look at a computer or the net during that time (what a relief), so there is lots for me to catch up on. I'll be off to Detroit either this weekend or next, and from the internet buzz this year's show has topped the one last year, didn't think that would be possible.

From what I've seen so far, Ford's new 500 Sedan looks like a few of the cars we've discussed here, namely the LS430 (front end) and any Audi product (roofline). I guess the latter detail shouldn't be a shock, one of the car's designers used to work for Audi.

pablo_l,

This union might just work, if and only if the public takes to Chrysler's new products over the next year, if all these new models (something like 10-15) don't fly then the whole thing is done, and I expect DCX to become Daimler-Benz once again.

3560,"January 4, 2004 11:23PM",i_drive,"all the repairs on the '02 S430 are under warrantee (airmatic, brake-booster, oxygen sensor, COMMAND...). Most didn't cost me a dime, but it took lot's of effort to get stuff like a decent loaner car. i felt compelled many many times to write a letter to MB demanding ""what can you do for me"" basically. i kept my temper many times (ask the dealership where i service/bought my cars).

The '99 ML320 didn't have much problems until late last year. then the bugs came up. what amazed me the most was when the front and rear bumpers fell off during a normal wash at the gas station. that was really pathetic (not to mention when there was a driver of a black X5, along with about 10 other people laughing at me.)

The '98 ML? Don't even ask about it.

I really think the S-Class is getting long in the tooth, particularily after seeing the Audi, BMW, and lexus at the autoshow. i don't mind the interior so much, but i think mb could have done a little bit more for the '03 ""refresh"", like lexus did with the '04 LS430. the '05/'06 S-Class better look ""radical"" or else."

The S class Mercedes has always been beautiful from day one and still is. The Lexus though is the one I think that ""better look radical or else"" as you put it, when the upcoming major redesign occurs."

I had occasion to see a new S , and to me it looked much nicer with the small chrome stripes on the tail light. I thought of our own Merc 1, but feel Mercedes is overpriced on the S model.

In NJ a 78K 7 series leases for almost the same as a $62k LS430. Wish I could figure out how. Either they are pushing losses to the future through the residuals or they've made a special expense reserve. i don't see any zero financing - a big NO-NO for any lux make so they aren't doing it that way."

3573,"January 6, 2004 2:31PM",ljflx,Someone at Lexus must have panicked over the LF-S. My sales guy at Ray Catena told me they had two GS designs and had thrown one out and delayed everything a year as a result. I would have thought this would have been the discarded design and not the LF-S. Maybe the LF-S was too great a change for them to swallow in one bite. This car doesn't look all that different to me from the current model particularly up front and on the side absent the fluted lines near the bottom. I wouldn't think twice about taking an E-class over this GS whereas I would have felt the exact opposite way about the LF-S. I think they missed the mark and they had a bullseye on it but time will tell. Then again I'm an an LS buyer anyway.

The moment everyone has been waiting for, the new GS. I won't say too much other than to say this is the reason why I don't get excited over Japanese concept cars, as they rarely make it to production un-altered. I had the new GS all planned out, as to how it would look, but it appears *so far* that all they did was warm over the current car. The front end, with it's grille down below the headlight line is like the concept, but the rear and sides are completely different and don't look nearly as good as the original concept. It appears Lexus even after all the talk about a new design language still doesn't know where to go. I do like the interior though, but I think if they really wanted to go after BMW they should have kept the I6 instead of switching to a V6. Anyway, I'll reserve final judgement until next week when I can see the car in person.

3578,"January 7, 2004 1:13AM",merc1,"Just curious to know what the group here thinks about some of the new luxury debuts at Detroit.

It appears that Audi is going to step to the major leagues with the new A8L 6.0 W12 by the end of the year, it will priced around 115K. Yikes! Double yikes because the Phaeton W12 (10hp less btw) is priced at 88K. On paper it makes the Audi version look like a tough sell. What does everyone think of the new grille design of the A8L 6.0 model? Car and Driver is reporting that a cheaper short wheelbase ""A8"" will make it here too for 2005. Audi sold over 4K A8s in 2003, a huge increase, but still about 1/5 of the sales leaders in the class.

Lexus' RX330 was clearly the inspiration for the Lincoln Aviator concept, looks pretty good.

The Aston-Martin DB9 Volante (convertible speak) is gorgeous, don't even need to be there in person so see that.

I so wish I could say the same for new 645Ci convertible. It and the regular 645Ci coupe will have to be examined in person, which isn't a good sign. I don't think I've ever seen a car so messed up by a single styling detail, a trunklid no less!!

Two sports cars of interest, the Ferrar 612S and Corvette. The Ferrari looks a little longish, just like the SLR, both have this look due to their engine placement, mid-front. The Vette looks a little derivative of several cars, Ferrari, Viper from the front, but the rest appears to be in order. Any of you luxury car owners eyeing a sports car????

Three new luxury or luxury priced trucks (or concepts) of interest: Jeep Rescue, Lincoln Mark LT and Infiniti QX56. I can't believe Lincoln would attempt this type of truck again, as the Blackwood flopped like the Edsel. The Jeep Rescue is the DCX answer to the Hummer. Not sure how I feel about it yet. The Infiniti might have too much of a Peterbuilt grille to it??

Another crossover, the Mercedes GST. Not sure about this yet either. It too lost something from concept to product, it looks too much like a van.

Though I think they're generally pretty clueless, they do have a hell of a photo gallery of the L.A. Autoshow, autospies that is. Of particular interest to the Cali show are the Maserati Quattroporte, Mercedes CLS, Aston-Martin DB9 Coupe, Hummer HT3, and the OMG Porsche Carrera GT, they really do have some great photos of these cars. The Mercedes CLS, which I admit to feeling ill when I first saw it, looks a lot better, as does the Maserati Quattroporte. Thought I've seen the new Bentley Continental GT in person at last year's Detroit show, the new photos still don't help it any, as it still looks like a giant VW. I'll take an Arnage T please.

ljflx,

I was so busy thinking about the autoshows that I didn't even see your comments on the 7-Series. Yes my *used-to-be* second favorite luxury car brand has stumbled design wise with the 7, 6 and now possibly with the 6-Series. Its hard to convey on a mesg board how a lot of BMW fans (including me) feel about BMW's new styling/design direction. What I really don't like is that BMW's top guy simply says that people will just have to get used to the look and tech (meaning idrive). Typical German arrogance, which I can't stand at times.

On the other hand it seems that just as many people like the new designs, some of my most devoted BMW-loving friends find the new 5 and 7 to have such great ""presence"". I won't argue with that, question is whether or not thats good or bad. Either way they aren't ""good looking"" cars in the classic sense of the description, but everyone does notice them, so lets sell how the 5-Series sells in 2004.

Seriously I think something went wrong at Lexus HQ in the late stages here. Why did we get all that press about the LF-S and then get this thing? If it wasn't a press release and was a spy pix instead I would have said it was a touched up version of the current car with a BMW notch back at best or maybe a stretched Altima. The car is very disappointing - at least in picture form - much like the 5 and 7 series are as far as I'm concerned. Maybe in the metal it will look better but I doubt it. On the other hand I'm not one to doubt customer studies as I have lived in that industry in the past. So maybe they have market research that shows better than I know.

Interesting observations from the Detroit Auto Show press/industry previews. I actually attended the Washington DC Auto Show this last weekend and am planning on going to the Detroit Show the weekend of the 18th. I will also be going to the NYC show in April since it is just a quick train ride from my NYC/NJ apartment.

At first, I was puzzled by the new MY06 GS but the more I look at the pictures and read about the upgraded technology, AWD and euro-driving intentions the more interested I get. One thing that troubles me is that I expected the new GS to be a MY05 car not MY06. The official press information just says the car will be available in 2005 but does not say what month. A MY06 designation would seem to say it will in October 05 or at least the later half of the year. However, I am still not sure what they are doing with the final new GS exterior design.

As ljflx stated, this means that the new LS will not be until MY07 which I assume means either October 2006 or April 2006 at the earliest. I still am holding on to our LS and was hoping to replace it with the new LS in October 2005 (as a MY06 release).

My wife really liked the silver 2004 LS we saw at the Washington Show but I believe that it will look really dated when the MY07 LS comes out. However, I feel Lexus really did improve the looks of the MY04 LS with only minor exterior revision. Until we really spent some serious time looking at it in silver (the color my wife would want) I had only seem a few at a distance on the highway.

As for BMW, I share ljflx's and your observations. I have had BMW's over the years and really like the last generation 7 series. My bottom line is that BMW is not even on my list of consideration anymore. I just wish that I had purchased the last generation 750Li before they came out with the current 7 series abortion.

By the way, I travel to Switzerland for business and the BMW 7 series is having even more sales problems there then here and it use to basically be BMW's best per-capita market.

Since I have always purchased all of my cars/trucks I typically try to wait for the new completely revised model before making a new purchase. In the case of the new 7 series that proved to be a big mistake.

I did come very close to purchasing a MB S600 a few months ago but was put off by all of the horror stories I keep hearing about MB having a lot of trouble with their computerized electronics. And, of course, the S600 basically has all of them. I was also put off buy the fact that MB excluded the S600 from the special 2.9% financing deal.

One other observation from the Washington Show, my wife and I did like the looks and feel of the Audi A8 L but not the VW Phaeton. The VW just left us both cold except for the interior. Also, the Audi is about 800 lb lighter with the same engine and overall size.

As for your comment on the Lincoln pick-up, I could not agree more. What the hell does anyone want (yet alone need) a Lincoln or Cadillac pick-up. Give me a break! And, I am actually getting ready to buy a new Dodge Ram for my place in Texas.

I enjoy you guys feed back and opinions. Please keep it up.

3583,"January 7, 2004 9:50PM",pablo_l,"The more I read about next generation cars, the more I think the entire car industry has taken a wrong turn.

In a nutshell, all of these new desgins are overweight, over-assisted and dynamically incompetent and unbalanced machines that need to be fixed by computer intervention. It is a brutal assessment, but nevertheless I think it true. They might be superbly comfortable transport appliances, but a pure driving environment they miserably fail to provide.

I think a smart luxury car vendor at this point in time would come in with a superbly crafted, but -other than ABS- utterly electronics-devoid car. Built to be light, engineered to be agile and competent without assistance. That would provide a huge and unique differentiator, and luxury buyers are borderline eccentric enough to ensure such a car would be a success. More of a private aircraft philosophy.

And while I love the idea of hybrids and their inherent efficiency, I'd love for at least *one* study to put the available torque to a slightly more rowdy use.

Are they dialing out the *fun* factor entirely out of the luxury car scene?"

Well unless you're a certain person on the ""News and Views"" board I won't say (harp) too much negatively about a persons's fav brand's new debut when it doesn't meet expectations...it can happen with any make.....I'm trying to be as fair as possible, on this board that is. I will say that I'm going to wait until next week before making a final judgement on the car. The only thing that's sort of curious to me as to why its going to take so long for it to go on sale, they're saying Spring 2005, thats seems like a long time to me.

I'm not sure what the S600L costs in Europe, I'll have to look it up. Could it be that the price C&D quoted could be in Euros?? Speaking of Mercedes and Europe, there is a new SLK for 2005. The pics/stats are on the germancarfans site, and the car will be shown to the public in March at Geneva.

On the A8, only the W12 model is getting the new grille, the V8 model will keep the current grille/look.

""I'm glad to see merc1 has his share of disappointment with his favorite brand as well.""

Well none of these brands are perfect, come to think of it Ferrari (Enzo), Porsche (Cayenne), Mercedes (CLK, Maybach), BMW (5,6(?)7) have all introduced something that wasn't a knockout like the rest of their cars. So no brand is perfect. The saving grace is the for Mercedes, Porsche, and Ferrari they all have some stunners left in their lineups, whereas BMW has only one left, the 3-Series, imo.

pablo_l,

You raise some good points, and I for one understand you perfectly, but the luxury crowd on the whole wants more and more features, you either provide them or be left behind. The biggest indication of this was when the most driver-biased car of the group, the 7-Series became a mobile computer in 2002. While it still drives right, the interface is oh so complicated.

3586,"January 8, 2004 4:31AM",footie,"You can have lots and lots of fun in SCCA racing where the race cars are bare bones, the dynamics something you can set up and your skill at driving is evident and measureable.

Street racing and exercising automobile dynamics in public is dangerous and encourages law enforcement to step up the ante in controlling auto hormones.

At some point in time, somebody in a grossly overpowered super car that is going 2x the speed limit will kill someone else. In the ensuing litigation the prosectuor is going to ask the jury the question the Walter Mittys all dread, ""If the speed limit in most places in our country is 65 - 70 mph, why in the world do manufacturers intentionally build automobiles that can go twice that fast? They must do it to encourage people to drive that fast and therefore share in the culpability for the death that was caused."" If the jury agrees, the auto industry is going to get a curve ball they have deserved for a long time.

Legislation could go into place to have governors on the cars. It would be easy for example to integrate GPS location info with a speed limit data base. That way your speed limit would be controlled to be suitable to local conditions. The system could be set up allow over speed for passing for a reasonable period of time.

3592,"January 8, 2004 10:57PM",i_drive,"last friday, drove my entire family up to los angeles to see the '04 car show there. starting from about Del Mar to the car show in LA, we followed:

Black Volkswagen Phaeton W12
Tectite '03/'04? Mercedes S500 4Matic
Black sapphire (not sure if it was just dirty black) 745Li.

At least it turned a two-hour drive into something exciting!
unfortunately, my 15-year son, who is also turning into a car freak, kept on dronning-on about how Audi is trying to enter the once-exclusive MB-BMW groupe with the 6.0 litre A8L V12. He thinks the A8L V8 is the best buy when compared to the MB S500, Lexus LS430, and BMW 745Li. I think he's going to be into luxury cars.

The Phaeton--- i really don't understand VW. Do they really think people are going to buy a $70,000 VW? Come on. I can get a Mercedes S-Class, BMW 7-series, Audi A8L, Lexus LS430 Ultra-Lux, the list continues. VW is entering dangerous waters here. The Phaeton i saw on I-5 was a W12 model. It was probably the owner/manager of the dealership, as it had a DLR plate. The rear-lights are also something. More like an alien; i think VW could have done a much better job with the rear. I always thought car companies need to work more on the rear (part. Lexus; RX, GS, GX...) because that's were most people see the car when on the road. And overall, not to be ignorant but i truly think the Phaeton is a big-Passat. The front headlights say it all. The driver and his family was heading towards the LA auto-show.

The 745Li, we saw about in Orange County. Passed the VW and us really quickly, but caught up to it in LA in the convention centre (outside). Why I am infatuated with the 7? The rear (so ingenious and creative), and the rear door. Another strange thing me and my son both pay extra-close attention about cars are door designs, and in my opinion, BMW best executed it in the 745Li and 760Li lwb models. the rear door is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous. I trully don't understand why soooooo many people find the design controversial. it might take some getting used to (i've got a close friend, and after about a month, I'm already used to iDrive). Granted, it's not exactly the most pleasing-to-the-eye design, like the S-Class, but it's something that should not be critized.

I'm convinced that the '04 S-Class is getting really long in the tooth, and needs to be redesigned soon. Although it's still a gorgeous car (i mean come one, a mercedes is a mercedes), but it could use some plastic surgery or a complete make-over. the 7-speed is a great progress, though, as i have tested it and it is truly amazing.

overall, in the car show, i determined that the two most popular cars were probably the BMW 645Ci and the LS430 Ultra-Lux. The BMW popularity surprised me, as while walking through the 7-series and 530i, i heard a lot of people saying stuff like ""i hate this design."" or ""let's go look at lexus"". but overall, it seemed as though people loved the 645ci, and so did i. i have become addicted to it (even more so than the 745Li). the interior is quite roomy, and quality was impressive.

The LS430, which greatly needed that refresh, is still a little to ""boxy"" and shared numerous characteristics with both the previous-generation S-Class (call it the cathedral-on-wheels) and the previous-generation CL-Class. The rear-seat affair was truly amazing, and I've got to give credit to the guys at Lexus; they did a damn good job at giving both the drivers and passengers lots of comfort.

I think lexus is trying to become more like a poor-man's Bently; luxurious, with a slight twist of power. Just look at the LS430 or SC430. They even bill their Sport Utility Vehicles ""Luxury Utility Vehicles"". Whereas Infiniti seems as though it's heading towards german BMW-land.

I don't know. I got mixed feelings from this car show.

by the way, my son just told me an interesting comparison; he calls Apple Computers the equivalent of Infiniti; great (almost) looking cars (like the G35 coupe/FX45), but whether or not their insides are that good remain to be seen). intersting thought."

That said the car does have a presence on the road that for better or worse, can't be denied. It makes the previous 7 look dull and tame by comparision.

Make no mistake about it, Lexus' priority is luxury, but unlike Bentley, they just don't have the style to match. Bentley also is lot more sportier and every one of their cars have more than just a ""twist"" of power, as hp is one of their major selling points. Lexus is more like Rolls-Royce than Bentley, at least the Rolls before BMW took over. Even the new Rolls Phantom mentions driving and hp figures in the sales literature, whereas before concerning hp all they would say is that their cars had ""adequate"" power, and ""driving"" was never mentioned. I see where the LS430 is similar to a Rolls in principle.

I've driven many, many vehicles with electronic enhancements and usually you can disable these for certain purposes. Even disabled the cars are more stable and safer than the older cars without these things. The simple fact is people drive a lot. Some people drive safely and cautiously, some don't. Just about everyone, no matter what their typical driving habits are, has a ""frantic moment"" where they over/under compensate. These things reduce these instances and help the overall ride quality.

The problem is not with the gadgets and electronics, it's with the manufacturers. Most notably, Mercedes Benz, who is trying to be the Chevrolet of the ""Status Marks"". In their zeal to flood the market with over 26 different models in 9 classes, they have lost sight of what originally made them a ""Status Mark"" - exclusivity and vault-like reliability. In loosing that, they have failed by having poor quality materials and design while still raising prices on models with absolutely no changes, year to year.

Advancements are good, in most cases, and any thing that works to save lives and injuries should be regarded as ""worth-while"".

I'm curious to know which Mercedes-Benzes are of ""poor design"". Reliability wise they have definitely taken a hit, but ""poor design""? The E, S, SL, CL, CLK all hit their market segments head on, only the ML is questionable, and maybe the C-Class if you're expecting a sporty 3-Series beater. Mercedes wasn't in a position to play the exclusive game anymore, they wouldn't have made it. Truth be told their bread and butter models C and E-Classes were never that ""exclusive"" as they've always sold in good numbers, especially the older Es and 190s. The ""exclusive"" ones are the AMGs, CL, and to a lesser degree the CLK and SL, unless you live in certain areas of the country in which I'm told these cars are more popular than Accords.

3601,"January 11, 2004 8:02AM",jamesfletcher2,"merc1,

Sorry but I was away for a few days on business. As for your question regarding my potential purchase of a 2003 S600 a few months ago, I recently decided to wait until the new generation S-Class comes to the USA to consider another one. The spy photos of the new S-Class is very interesting.

As for your comments that MB has the electronics and other issues worked out with the current (MY04) S-Class - I would tend to agree. However, it is of concern to me that it has taken them 3 - 4 model years to get the model to that point. My wife and I have owned more MBs, BMWs and Audi Quattros then I can remember (especially MBs). The Audi Quattros were a blast but required so much service I had to develop a ""warm individual relationship with my Audi service tech"". The MBs were great (until recent generations), if some what non-exciting. As I mentioned, I no longer even consider BMW because of the i-Drive and ugly exterior design. I still have concerns for Audi service requirements.

That being said, I purchased my first Lexus LS for my wife a few years ago after they came out with their vvt-i engines that finally gave them decent power and some tire and suspension upgrades for more euro-type handling. As ljflx has often stated well, I do not have time for cars to have problems even if I have someone that works for me take the car to the dealership.

I remember a post ljflx made which hit it on the head for me. Thankfully, I am able to purchase any car sold around the globe without more then a slight consideration to price. Period. However, the COST of the overall ownership is another matter (including my time and that of other with me). And, that is where the German companies are losing their focus and don't understand their modern potential or existing customers.

I came close to purchasing a Bentley 2 - 3 years ago but was put off by dependability concerns. I travel extensively all over the world and when I'm back home I expect a car (or SUV/truck) to work and delivery the type of drive they were engineered for. As I recall ljflx hinting, the fact that Lexus cost less is of no consideration to many buyers. It is other factors that drive my car purchases.

What I tend to do is purchase many different cars and trucks/SUVs at different homes I have for different needs or desires. And in the luxury car area, currently, Lexus is delivering more of what customers what! So, I have been going their way even though I am a very recent owner. I would still like to own another MB or two but am still waiting to see.

3602,"January 11, 2004 10:28AM",hage57,"I just read your last post with interest. What you and ljflx say about Lexus great service and lack of problems is very true. I live about 1 1/2 to 2 hours from either a Lexus or Audi dealer, and over the last 15 years I have driven both, three LS 400/430 and couple Audi's, my last being a '98 A8. The difference in reliability and service are very noticeable. Having said that, I just spent some time in a new A8L, and was very impressed (maybe I just need a change, I'm driving an '01 LS 430), but I'm still concerned with reliability and service.

On another matter- As we were walking around the city `Charleston S.C.` I noticed the owner of `our` Lexus dealership pulling out of his drive. I waved him down and asked him about why he was driving a new Mercedes..He certainly has had the success to deserve a new Mercedes, but after all he should be setting an example for the rest of his customers. His lame excuse is that he had purchased almost all of the dealerships in Haiwii( which according to the news paper happened) and Mercedes was one of them.. Merc 1 would certainly have enjoyed that irony..After all when you can drive anything, Mercedes is the current choice of the super wealthy..I might further add that this gentleman has earned his money , and alot of it.

jamesfletcher2,

Well as its been the case everytime so far, its very interesting to get the thoughts of a buyer who says:

""Thankfully, I am able to purchase any car sold around the globe without more then a slight consideration to price. Period.""

That is tall statement indeed. The only thing I'm wondering though is whether or not you're missing out on some very special cars, like a Bentley because you place reliability so high. I guess the way I see it, if I had that kind of money other cars (Lexus, #1 in reliability) would be my daily driver and the lesser ones (Bentley, highend MBs, Ferraris etc) would be there for other times. Just my little (much, much shorter money) take on it...lol.

anthonycecil,

A defection in the Lexus camp! Seriously though I we can only guess as to what his true reasons are. Though it has to be said that there a lot of dealerhip owners here that don't drive the cars they sells, some don't even care for them.

For you guys considering the new Bentley Continental GT: This new car is a VW based product, for better or worse. It shares its basic chassis with the VW Phaeton, and it's W12 engine, but the Bentley adds a turbocharger for it's additional hp. I'm not sure where Bentley would place on the all-important JDP and CR reliability surveys, but we do know where VW comes in at. To ask a current Bentley owner (Arnage, Continental T, Azure) owner how reliable his car has been won't help much because the new Continental GT shares almost nothing with them, and the car it shares most of it's guts with (VW Phaeton) is also brand new, so I'm not sure if there is any data to look at, other than lesser VW's reliability. Or maybe, if available some data the Phaeton's reliability in Germany/Europe since it's been on sale there since 2002.
That could be used as a starting point I guess.

i_drive,

I too saw that picture of the new S' interior, supposedly. I'd say that they got a shot of the 2005 7-Series' interior, you know the refresh thats coming. For Mercedes to copy BMW down the look of their interior is beyond reality. Someone is dead wrong on this one, we'll see who.

In 2003 I'm told Lexus in Ocean beat out the MB dealership in Edison - for the first time - so he may have to swap out the SL for an SC.

Merc1 - I am not all that excited by that car but the next gen S-class looks like a nice evolution. What did you think of it? I think Automobile had a small story with pictures.

So, I enjoy offering corrections or at least a wake-up call.

And until someone disproves the huge statistical samplings and statistical techniques that Consumer Reports and JDPowers do here in the U.S., the conclusions that they draw about likely experience for any given brand is the best predictor to which we can offer advice.

Remember that the car companies are full of statistics folks capable of shooting holes in the JDP or CR ratings. They probably scrub them pretty hard.

Then I had to go to Scottsdale for all of last week for meetings with a client. But I am back, and did fly up to the Detroit Auto Show on Saturday. (I hope you had a nice holiday.)

You should have no concerns about the new GS. The car is a knockout in my eyes. There are many details of the car that don't show up well in photos but do in person. For instance, the headlights are part of a wide ""sweep"" of sheetmetal that juts out from the side of the car. Hard to see in photos but very nice up close (taken from the LF-S). The car looks nothing like a Maxima either; it is far more substantial and sporty. I feel the car is very unique, and the narrow side windows with a curving arch will become part of the Lexus ""look"" on future cars. If anything, the car looks a bit like a BMW 745 in the greenhouse.

Having the current GS on the floor next to the the new GS (which was on a turntable) really showed off the differences between the two.

Who in the world left you in charge of anything? Everything is a reliability survey, even when nobody is talking about reliability. I made a statement with a ""as I'm told"" being clearly stated reguarding the SL's exclusivity yet you've come done from the mountain with CR in one arm and JDP in the other giving the same old rhetoric. What in the world does JDP and CR have to do with anything I said reguarding exclusivity? Nothing. Who made any statements about CR or JDP being wrong or incorrect? No one.

In fact I even told anthonycecil and others to check JDP and CR about Bentley/VW, so where you're half-baked post came from I'm not sure. Re-read the last post again. I clearly stated that JDP and CR is the place to check this info out for the questions the posters were asking, yet you bring up Mercedes and Lexus, when the question was about Bentley. I even clearly stated that Lexus is #1 in reliability per these very surveys you life and breathe by, yet you come back with some unrelated bs.

Instead of trying to berate everything I said, why don't you dig up some information on Bentley's reliability like the original posters were asking? No watch you not say anything about Bentley because your precious surveys don't cover them, yet you're the one with all the knowledge here. Can you comment on anything except reliability concerning these cars? Probably not. Don't tell me about people you know that own this or drive that because that doesn't give the picture of the entire brand.

Now because others used outdated information before and couldn't accept that they didn't have the facts right, the board is now full of misinformation, that figures. Especially when their ""generalzations"" were proven to be wrong. Yet you come here with this survey crap when no one is even talking about reliability, yet that is supposed to be the end all that encompasses the complete automotive experience. Dude pluhease.

3625,"January 14, 2004 8:53PM",ljflx,"I think when you view individual car stories or even individual car write-ups within a comparative test they provide plenty of data and much of it is good. It is the subjective opinions that they make that are so objectionable. Some of them are so bad that they make those opinions overwrite the actual test results and its clear to me that they preselected the winner before they even tested the cars. My other problem is that they only view the car from an enthusiast point of view (and they also tend to test cars against each other that have different biases thereby making it a worthless test in some cases) and don't weight enough into the whole ownership experience. This is where reliability - which they dismiss so easily - is critical.

Conumers reports - the value is in the data they collect and then how they report on it regarding reliability, body integrity, electrical systems etc. They do not view the car through an enthusiast eyes at all (though they have moved a bit in that direction) and are probably the opposite of the auto mags by viewing it (particularly in the past) almost entirely through an ownership experience with the weight being on both past and predicted car reliability based on their ownership survey (which is very large). However they have started to point out fun to drive factors and have rated the old 5-series extremely high and point out BMW handling as superior to most. They've also constantly pointed out that the A8 has an inferior ride to the S-class and LS430 and state that the latter two are among the finest cars in the world. Their only issues with the S-class are its poor reliability and high price. Otherwise they score that car sky high. I think they know what they are doing (note they were the first, or one of the first, to point out the big drop in MB reliability) but its not the place to go to get an enthusiast viewpoint of a car. But without question they are way more trusted then any auto magazine by consumers and they are not the least bit concerned about advertising as the former are. They are also quite ready to be bold and can move the whole market - witness Isuzu in the 90's."
3626,"January 14, 2004 11:50PM",merc1,"How can they test reliability when they only have the car for a week or so? They can't be the judge on that so why even try to rate that quality? Would you rather they guess about it? I haven't ever seen where they ""dismiss"" reliability, they simply don't cover it. Despite what the most loyal survey clutchers will say, Mercedes, Audis and other ""unreliables"" are able to keep it together during testing, rendering reliability scoring by car mags pointless. This is why car mags do long term tests. Road and Track just took a 2004 Jaguar XJ8 and they're going to keep it for 50K miles, and they'll rack up those miles a lot faster than most owners will. So is this test not worth anything?

Its just the opposite with Consumer Reports, they couldn't give the enthusiast anything to read about if they tried. It's pretty much like Don says, they look at cars like appliances, and if the car mags test wildly different cars, then CR does the same thing. Isn't there an issue out now with just about every entry level sedan on the market test against each other? The ES330 doesn't belong in a test with a BMW 330i, it's ridiculous to compare these two in any way other than reliability, as their on-road purpose and mission is completely different.

How can you say that Consumer Reports is trusted by more consumers than the mags are? This is based on what? Millions of people read the mags just as much as they do Consumer Reports.

It still comes down to what you're looking for reguarding information on a car. Consumer reports hardly rules though, all CR did with Isuzu is put the final nail in the coffin. If they did rule the market hardly any European cars would be sold. They've harped about how poor their reliability is for years now with virtually no affect on sales. VW is shinning example of this, during the late 90's while CR was serving up the bad press about them, their sales went from 50K in 1993 to over 300K within 10 years, bad reliability and all.

It all boils down to this, if you want stats and numbers about reliability read CR, but if want the ""car"" aspect of the car then read the automags. There is no way for you to know which one is more trusted by they entire market, that judgement can only be made by the individual buyer.

3627,"January 15, 2004 8:54AM",footie,"<< The car companies send vehicles to CR BEFORE they start selling them for suggestions and feedback. Ford sent the new Freestar over, GM send in the Cadillac CTS and so on...>>

From USA Today in September, a good synopsis of the power of CR and the value that consumers place in its reporting:

""Since its first auto test 50 years ago, Consumer Reports has become the No. 1 source that car buyers turn to when buying a new or used vehicle.""

<< I think that enthusiasts are a small part of the overall market >>

More than 40% of car shoppers use Consumer Reports for information, and in some segments &#151; minivans, for example &#151; nearly 60% of buyers use the magazine, according CNW Marketing/Research. That makes Consumer Reports the biggest single source of information car buyers use.

<< This has been the case for some time >>

The magazine, published by Consumers Union, a non-profit testing and information-gathering organization, ...has added seven automotive publications throughout the year to its traditional April auto issue; has a vehicle comparison test in every issue; and will spend $1.9 million to test 56 vehicles this year, up from $1.1 million for 41 vehicles in 1998.

<< They don't take anything from the auto companies and return free gifts from any manufacturer >>

ConsumerReports.org has 1.2 million paid online subscribers. A subscription costs $26; online access is $24 a year. Four million readers subscribe.

<< a couple of bucks a month has saved many consumers the heartache, time and $ from buying a lousy car from companies with reliability and quality problems>>

Wall Street analyst Scott Hill of Alliance Bernstein estimates that about 18 million consumers see the magazine's automotive recommendations annually through subscriptions, pass-along copies, online or in stories about its recommendations in other media.

<< 18 million consumers is (not conincidently) just a bit bigger than the new vehicle unit sales in the U.S.>>

<< Your comments about VW failed to note that VW's sales peaked a couple of years ago and fell sharply in 2003. Perhaps that was due to the quality and reliability problems that were highlighted by the recent ignition coil problem>>

<< I think consumer markets can respond slowly but when they turn they can often be hard to reverse. >>"
3628,"January 15, 2004 11:18AM",ljflx,"I have extensive experience in the media and marketing information industry and couldn't agree with you more. CR is very deeply respected by consumers and manufacturers and the latter know it is the bible for most consumers - be it cars, appliances, packaged goods or services.

Merc1 - The reason the auto mags don't want to deal with reliabilty in their analysis is partly because the last thing they want to do is bring CR into their stories. Everyone knows it's the ultimate resource consumers turn to for nearly anything they buy and the more expensive the item the more crucial CR becomes. There is hardly an issue where cars are not dealt with and the April issue is all cars. Information database companies would kill to get at CR's database - the information is invaluable. Match the data to CR's subscriber base on a demographic profile basis (no one is interested in the individual personal data - per se) and you have incredible market information to sell to manufacturers. CR will not let it happen though as their integrity will be compromised. The statement that no one would buy a european car if they read CR is a bad one. It might be accurate if reliability is the only reason to buy a car but we all know it is not. But to some, myself included, poor reliability is a deal breaker."
3629,"January 15, 2004 11:27AM",michael_mattox,"Merc says:

 ""How can they test reliability when they only have the car for a week or so? They can't be the judge on that so why even try to rate that quality?""

Merc. shame on you, you know very well that consumer reports rates quality based on user questionairs sent out each year. New cars are always reported as new and no data available. Established model lines are rated based on information gathered over time and reported by users.

Some models do not get reliability ratings because they are relatively low production cars or CR receives too few evaluations from users.

If you look carefully at the Used Car reliablity ratings you will see that each new model year (going back 5 years) can have variences in their ratings (except toyota which is always all red)"
3630,"January 15, 2004 12:08PM",charlienmr1,"Like most information sources, you need to know what the data theyuse is based on. CR uses very limited data, to put it mildly, in evaluating car reliability. Please read the information on this link.

I like the non-enthusiast point of view that they take. But to say they are the bible seems to me to be giving them way to much credit. If more people understood statistics (and I do) then they would take what CR says as just one of many sources, rather than the only one."

ljflx,

""The reason the auto mags don't want to deal with reliabilty in their analysis is partly

Says who? If that were the case all these expensive, unreliable cars from Mercedes, Volvo, Audi, Saab, Jaguar and others wouldn't sell at all considering the marks they get. Most (not all) people who typically know what kind of car they want (especially expensive ones) aren't going to be swayed by people who test VCRS and cam corders. You're saying that everyone worships Consumer Reports and that couldn't be any further from the truth. You wouldn't buy an Audi based on what they say, yet over 80K people last year did buy an Audi.

""The statement that no one would buy a european car if they read CR is a bad one. It
might be accurate if reliability is the only reason to buy a car but we all know it is not. But to some, myself included, poor reliability is a deal breaker.""

Thats just what I'm saying, thats your case. You place reliability ""sky high"" but everybody doesn't. Clearly they don't. I'm not saying that a lot of people don't ""consult"" CR, but to assume that all that do make their purchased based on CR is too big of an assumption for anyone here to make. Again if they did why do so many cars that they say to ""avoid"" end up selling very well. The placed the CLK on the avoid list, especially used ones...yet the car has the resale of any luxury coupe on the market. Look it up. This only proves that there is a whole group of buyers that either didn't consult CR or if they did, they obviously didn't care. If everyone held CR as a bible the CLK's (just one example) resale would be in the toilet.

footie,

As far as CR having 4 million subscribers...between Car and Driver, Road and Track, MT and Automobile and others like Autoweek, there are far more people at least reading ""autorags"" than Consumer Reports.

Unless USA Today talked to everyone that bought a car last year, a newspaper article doesn't mean anything to me.

VW's sales problems are mainly due to old product, Passat, Jetta, Golf and Bettle have all been around since 1997 or 1998. Ignition coils would be the least of worries for the average VW owner, they have other problems that are far more frequent, I know you of all people know this. The ignition coil problem hasn't caused the headache that the window relay switch problem did in the past. My point is that VW has far more persistant problems than the ig coil and they've had them before 2003, the year of the sales down turn. You have to look at the whole picture. VW also refused to play the incentives game like GM, Ford, Chrysler, Toyota and Honda. They only reluctantly gave some incentives on certain cars, not nearly the amount that the domestics give.

An ""estimate"" by the WSJ means what? Ok so they estimate 18 million read CR while in a waiting room getting their tire changed and on someone's coffee table. Do you really think the car mags don't reach even more people when they have more subscribers than CR does with at least 4 different major publications that can be passed around.

You come along anytime anyone else posts anything that isn't factual, yet you're passing a bunch of estimates by USA Today and the WSJ off as fact, two publications that don't know anything about cars in general. All they can do is tell you what people read, not if they make the buying decisions because of it.

Again, guys I'm not saying CR isn't important...even I have read them extensively when looking at Audis, or that the majority of people buying a car don't consult them, but to say they rule the market and that everyone makes their actual buying decision based on CR is absurd. Otherwise some makes would never get their product out the showrooms. If reliability reports is your thing fine, I personally will never that decide what car I buy, but that doesn't explain why hundreds of thousands of people still bought cars that are listed as being ""unreliable"" by CR. Everyone doesn't place as much weight on what they say or on reliability. Their road tests are joke. I'll ask again is there an issue out now in which a BMW 330i is in a comparo with a Lexus ES330? If that is the case, and I saw this on another board, CR is clueless on which cars are for which market. Yet they're to be trusted in everything? Thats ridiculous.

Just like you guys could care less about what MT, Car and Driver, Automobile and Road and Track was to say during a road or comparision test. There is no way I could say that everyone that reads C&D (3 million) bases their decision off of what they say. You'd have to conduct and exit poll at every dealer to come to such sweeping conclusions. If such data exists I'd love to read it....Footie?

3632,"January 16, 2004 7:37AM",motownusa,"People are not stupid, at least most aren't. Nobody is going to pay 80 grand for a car that will leave them stranded after six months. I think, one reason Toyota is doing so well in North America is because of their high reliability ratings from Consumer Reports. In fact in the last ten years, Toyota has surpassed Daimler Chrysler to become the third largest auto company in the world. It will be second largest in less than a year if it hasn't already. Toyota I think sold more vehicles than Ford worldwide in 2003. CR is partly responsible for Toyota's success in North America."
3633,"January 16, 2004 8:22AM",mfullmer,"... It's clear you have no clue as to how Consumer Reports tests cars. Here are some FACTS directly from their website:

CR anonymously purchases the vehicles they test (40-50 per year).

CR's 18 automotive specialists, engineers, and technicians not only drive the vehicles on their 327 acre testing facility but thousands of miles on public roads over several months.

CR uses the yearly subscriber survey to compile data for reliablity and ownership experience.

Yes, not everyone buys only cars they recommend but the vast majority of informed car buyers look to them for reliable, unbiased data.

For the consumer who is looking to purchase an automobile that is reliable and is concerned with the ownership experience related to normal car driving - commuting, vacationing, etc. - it is certainly the most substantiated source.

Of course, CR to the people who purchase vehicles for vanity and ""look-at-me"" status, is nothing but dribble."

3638,"January 16, 2004 5:20PM",carboy12,"I know that Mercedes has a much lauded history, but my own recent experience is very disappointing.

I have recently been through three months of mediocre experience with a new E class. After years of wanting a MB, I finally went for it, but I now regret this deal!!! I have been to the dealer too many times in the past three months for service issues. I also find the interior rather bland for a car that cost so much.

I went to Mercedes after driving a five year old Lexus GS. However, these days I often think that I would rather be driving my old Lexus. It was more reliable with 68,000 miles than this MB has been in the first three months.

In the first four months of ownership I have had four trips to the dealer. This is more interesting-- since a close relative also has a 2003 E class, and he also has numerous complaints.

Meanwhile, my 74 year old mother has recent MB C class, and I think very little of it. What an overpriced piece of junk! It has the Mercedes cache from the outside, but it is really very uninspired basic vehicle. At least her C class has been relatively reliable.

Of course, the ""issues"" with the past few years of S class Mercedes has seem well known by most. Admittedly, the latest editions are showing better reliablity, and improved fit and finish, but the past few years of S class production has been far from inspiring. In fact, I have two friends who left the MB fold in the past six months after S class dissatisfaction with 2001 and 2002 MB S Class cars.

So, I see some of the people here really have an ""over the top"" love of Mercedes, but I have to wonder whether this is just a lust, like I used to have for this marque, or something based on a real ownership experience. The day-in, day-out ownership experience offers a real life perspective! Try it, before touting MB.

I am stuck, so I will try to like my Mercedes, but I am having a hard time with it.

Needless to say, I think that the view from a distance, while dreaming and lusting for a Mercedes, is nothing like the actual MB ownership experience."

That isn't anything to snicker about. Yes, the car looks beautiful from the outside, it's the electrical gremlin that is just crippling its image.

If MB execs are reading these boards, they'd better do something QUICK. Reputation for bad quality and unreliability can be slow to catch on, but once it does, it's all downhill. Can't stop a rolling stone on a downhill slope !

Having nothing but Lexus cars since 1995 (save a Landcruiserin the late 90's- which really is a Lexus for the most part anyway) can really spoil you. In 2001 I looked long and hard at the S-class but lacked confidence in it. I just knew the LS430 would yield three more years of perfection in a glorious car and I feared that the MB S, while a glorious car also, would have a rash of problems. Plus it just didn't match the LS in ride or cabin quietness. Results have perfectly matched expectations on not one, but two LS cars including my business car which is now at 60k miles. I only need one car this go round and in April it will be another LS which I fully expect will give me another perfect trip for 3 years. My first LS in 95 is still running very well - in the care of a friend - and has over 200k miles on it. My 98 car became a Lexus certified car but I don't know where it ended up. Both of these 2001's will make whoever takes them very happy. Not even a hint of a rattle and as whiser quiet as day one out of the showroom.

A friend of mine just traded his 1998 Landcruiser for a Lincoln Aviator. The TLC had 140k miles on it and never had a problem. The Aviator is giving him a lot of headaches within the first few months. I bumped into my buddy at a school function the other day and he said he didn't know what he was thinking when he switched but he'd trade the Aviator back for his TLC in a heartbeat if he could. It's not easy to move from the near perfect world of Toyota and Lexus. It may never occur for me. You could have had a helluva LS430 instead of that E-class. I hope you leased."

Steering Wheel Groans upon Retraction (Fixed under Warranty)

Wiper Sensor Failure. Replaced under Warranty.

So, that's nothing terrible compared to the MB stories we've heard. The only thing I can say is that my 1992 LS was better. The sole issue was a burnt out tail light at 11 yrs of age. Aside from the fact some idiot hit it two months ago, everything was fine. This brings me to my next question:

3660,"January 20, 2004 2:03PM",ljflx,"Maybe the exchange rate is the cause as it is killing them. There was a story in the NY Times about how well hedged against the currency variations the Euro car makers were. VW was poorly hedged. MB was pretty well hedged and easily in the best position with a hedge factor in the 90's (having Chrysler helps them as well and is a natural hedge) and BMW was somewhere in the middle but lacks the further protection of owning a US make ala MB. The strength of the Euro is so high that you can actually buy a Porsche Carrera and a Cayenne in the US for the price of a Carrera in Europe. VW and Porsche were ony about 70% hedged if I remember right, so work the math on 30% of a Cayenne on each sale a Carrera makes. Ouch! But that is the profit hit they are taking on unit sales in the US due to the strength of the Euro. I don't know if that puts them in a loss position or not on their US unit sales but it certainly cuts heavily into the estimated profits they made for the financial community. They probably have some room to raise Phaeton prices (given they were low to begin with and the sales projections were also quite low) but I don't know if they can do so on anything else without taking a volume hit. Their treasurer must be in a heep of trouble."
3661,"January 20, 2004 2:55PM",syswei,"Currency hedges, when put in place, are typically not for multi-year time horizons...as old hedges expire new ones will be at prevailing rates...and US pricing of European and Japanese imports will tend to go up (beyond inflation)...so anyone contemplating buying an import over the next couple years might want to think about purchasing sooner rather than later."
3662,"January 21, 2004 6:46PM",ljflx,I'm anxiously awaiting your Detroit report.
3663,"January 21, 2004 11:50PM",merc1,"I'll shorten this from the News and View version which covers ""everything"". I spent two days total at the show, it's so much more than Chicago's autoshow.

Acura has proven to me that they don't hold water to the Euro luxury brands past the TL class. The RL and NSX sat unloved with all the attention at the Acura display going to the TL and TSX. I heard one person say, ""this is their new sports car"", pointing to the NSX. I wanted to say, dude this ""new"" car is 15 years old!!!

 BMW has lost me. The 5-Series has an interior to match the exterior, a mess. Did anyone check where the door grab handles line up with the dash when the doors are closed? The only BMW I like now is the M3. I could barely do anything until I laid my eyes on the 6-Series. Rarely does a coupe look better than it's convertible counterpart, but this is the case with the 6. The convertible's top up look is truly ugly. The Coupe is no beauty either, but in a darker color it does *somewhat* hide that hideous trunk lid. What the hell is BMW on?

Lexus' new GS...ah the subject of much infighting within the Lexus camp. Another not ugly, not much to look at design from Lexus. It has a hint of the new 5 in the front-fender treatment and its grille is pure Camry Solara, but overall it isn't as bad as some have said, including me. If anything it's just too derivative. Ironically autospies is saying the LF-S is the next IS, figures since they said it was the GS before. Does it look better than the E-Class (the car I see most compared to the GS), heck no it's not even close. Otherwise Lexus' display was just as unimpressive as their lineup of cars. One thing about Lexus that impressed even me, was their JDP awards display. My god they've won every award possible!

Infiniti was all the rage except for the M and Q ""45"" models that sat mainly with their doors closed and no lookers. The QX56 has way too much grille, other than that it looks pretty good. Then again, I like the Nissan version also. The G35 Coupe (before I buy one) is missing one thing, a decent interior. So cheap it is.

Audi.....always one of my favorites. One of my favorite sedans of all time, the current A6 is finally showing its age. It looks dated next to the A6 and A8, though it took 7 years to get to that point. The price has gone up a lot too, a loaded 2.7t ""S line"" model is 50K!! The new-look grille on the A8L 6.0 is gorgeous. It says power, which is what the A8L 6.0 has. The LeMans Quattro is another stunner. Not sure how accurate this is, but one of the reps said look for the production version at the 2006 NAIAS.

Ferrari and Maserati are 1 for 2. The 612 Scagletti, while not ugly or as questionable as the Enzo was upon first glance, does have some issues. Two things, the long hood and the space over the front wheels, far too much space in the wheel wells. I'll have to wait and see this one in different colors because the side treatment is hidden in dark red paint of the one car they had on display. This is not a good sign, it should be love at first sight with Ferraris. Look for a facelifted 360 Modena at Geneva in March.

The Maserati Quattroporte on the other hand looked just like I thought it would. Unique, and different, but a looker. It's interior is even better than the exterior. What a sensuous luxury car compared the S-Class, 7-Series, LS, and A8. Only the Jaguar XJ approaches this car in that respect. Major crowds at their combined displays, I mean can't even move around or get closer to the display without pushing type of crowd. So stylish the Italians are!

Mercedes-Benz. Why wasn't the CLS flown in after the L.A. show was over? The GST should be hit with the crossover crowd.....it looks ok I guess, me no likem SUV/Crossover things much. The SLR was stunning, and smaller than I thought it would be. People stood around in a daze. I still say Mercedes' ""best"" car is the CL coupe, it felt custom made for me. The E55 and SL55 drew a lot of attention too. The SLK is done, little or no interest. Look for a Geneva debut for its replacement. The S-Class is in ""classic"" status now, still looking good, but you sense there is something new coming soon, and it is. The CLK, while not as hot as the previous generation (to me, the market says different) had a considerable line waiting to sit in them, especially the Cabrio models.

Aston-Martin. Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous. The DB9 Volante had people mesmerized. I heard all kinds of conversation about this car. They could have picked a better color than that powerdery blue for the interior, but still a real looker. Ahh..the Vanquish a pit-bull on wheels. Can't say enough about how good these cars look. Same level of people as Ferrari/Maserati display. Thick.

Bentley. The Continental GT is a hit with the press and show goers alike, but it looks like a giant VW or some type of shoe to me. They had one there and it was the ugliest blue you can imagine. One thing about the Conti though is that it makes the Arnage and Arnage RL look like they're from another era, of which they are. Not quite as crowded as the above brands, but still crowded.

VW, yes VW they have some ""high-end"" products now. Surprise, surprise, people actually liked the Phaeton a lot, which I just my first TV commercial on, btw. Nobody seemed to be shocked at how much it costs. Did people looking at it know that its a relative of the A8 and is made by basically the same company? Seems they did. The Phaeton is also a comfortable car too, especially in the rear seat. Lots of buttons though. This biggest of VWs might have a chance here judging purely on the crowd reaction to it is any indication."
3664,"January 22, 2004 12:00AM",merc1,"Notes:

Mercedes had a Smart car there, lots people *trying* see inside it. I say trying because it's so small that if too many people get to close it looked like it would tip over.

BMW's X3 will most likely be a runaway sales hit, but those black baby-buggy bumpers have go to go. The interior looks just like the Z4, and it doesn't fit the SAV imo.

Out of all the cars I sat in, the Volvos had the best seats. The S60R and S60 T6 Premier to be exact. Pure comfort. I almost forgot, the Volvo S40. Pretty good, you can't tell it shares parts with a Ford.

The cars that made the biggest impression on me were the Aston-Martin DB9 Volante (possibly the best looking car there), Mercedes SLR (functional styling like the Enzo), Rolls-Royce Phatom (in black its downright evil looking, like something a cartoon character would drive), Vauxhall VX (man what a roadster), VW Concept R (another roadster), Audi A8L 6.0 and lastly the VW Phaeton.

Least impressive, Maybach, Lexus GS, Corvette......while they all might be great cars, all three lose points with me on styling.

3665,"January 22, 2004 5:51AM",designman,"Merc 1... nicely done... thoroughly enjoyed reading your report as I do with all cogent commentary on style.

One thing I would like to comment on is &#147;I'll have to wait and see this one in different colors...&#148; with regard to Enzo. I believe a well-designed car looks good in any color, even one&#146;s least favorite. If you have to judge it by color, the car is compromised IMO.

Your distaste for BMW has been no secret and I share your scorn. I&#146;m not sure what will replace my &#147;antique&#148; 03 530 down the road, but if BMW doesn&#146;t get its act together it will be out of my life. It never ceases to amaze me what they have done to their ENTIRE repertoire. And it&#146;s not over... we will have to endure the new 3 and 1.

&#147;So stylish the Italians are!&#148; Amen. In addition, there is this independent sports-car maker in Stuttgart who also has something going with minimalism. I anxiously await the arrival of 997 and surely hope Porsche can remain autonomous. I also like the SLR... has some art deco to it. In any event thank God for sports cars, without which I&#146;d be aesthetically starved. Everything else seems to be getting uglier by the day."
3666,"January 22, 2004 6:25AM",merc1,"Yes, I must be honest, that ""I must see it different colors"" line is really an excuse for an ugly car, most of the time. However this time I truly couldn't see how much of a scoup the car has on its sides because of the dark color and my viewing distance from it. The dark color also hides the length of the car. I suspect they did this intentionally, Ferrari ususally uses their signature red, not that dark red. But then again that bright red wouldn't look right on their ""GT"" car, as the 456 never wore red either. It always dressed in dark Blue or Black. I guess I need to see the car in silver, but yes I ninety-nine percent agree, a good looking car wears any *appropriate* color well. Meaning even an A8 can't wear Orange.

The next few years will be very telling for BMW. I think that once the new got-to-have it factor wears off the 5 its sales too will drop, just like the 7-Series. If BMW uglifies the M3 I'm done with them......it is the only remaining good looking BMW to me. You could have never told me this would happen back in 2001.

As others have said your report on Detroit was great.

I had planned on going but missed the Detroit show for the first time in three years or so. I try to go every year just to fight the wind and cold on Jefferson Avenue going into Cobo.

When I saw two versions of the new BMW 5 Series at the DC Show and the rest of the BMW models, I also could not believe what has happen to BMW. I know I have said this before, but as a prior BMW owner I do not even consider them anymore. It is such a shame what has been done to one of the great automotive brands in just 3 years or so. If it wasn't for the Mini and their SUVs they would be in serious sales trouble.

Did Lexus show the HPX at this show and if so what did you think. I know the minivan is not your cup of tea but some of us are married with kids and need these type of vehicles. Also is BMW going anywhere in the GST/HPX segment or ignoring it altogether. God only knows what a Bangle designed minivan would look like. Do you really think BMW is going to let him wreck their vaunted 3-series? I think you're right - 5-series will do well for a brief period and fall like a rock. That's why I think Lexus is making such a big mistake with the next GS.

Any hint at the show about the next gen S-class?

I saw your less than stellar comments about the Maybach but did you happen to see the Rolls?

ljflx,

Yes Lexus did show the HPX, it looked smaller than I thought it would be. It's just a raised station wagon, to me. The new GS however should have had the HPX's front end and sides, it would look a lot better. Funny you should ask about BMW and the HPX/GST market. Autospies has a article clearly showing BMW's Chris Bangle looking over the GST, along with other high-level BMW execs. Britian's ""CAR"" magazine has an article about 2 crossovers that BMW is supposed to be planning. I'm sure they aren't going to ignore it, but they'll be hard pressed to get a crossover to stay true to the BMW ""driving"" theme.

Yes the BMW 3-Series is next in line for the Bangle treatment. In his defense the new 6-Series wasn't designed by him, but Bangle is the head of BMW design so he takes all the flac. They'll probably tone it down for the 3-Series, but if that trunklid is part of the deal then forget about a good looking car.

Yes (see post after report) I saw the Rolls, stunning in every way except for the front end treatment, it looks unfinished.

""Finally - given all the cars you saw - what is your dream car and what is your reality car? ""

If I must pick one it would be the Aston-Martin DB9 Volante. Such a gorgeous car. Reality cars: Infiniti G35 Coupe (interior redo is rumored for 05'), Saab 9-3 Aero, Audi A4 3.0, and in the distance.....the revised 05' C-Class.

lexus0622,

I said that before huh....I guess I'm holding firm on that opinion of the car. Do you realize what a new Bentley is supposed to do to the high-end market? Its supposed to be the second coming, and this Continental GT just fell way short of that. It's so NOT attractive.

Very interesting, call me fickle; however, even though I detest the E60 and E65, I love the E63. I was actually wondering if Chris Bangle had finally gotten one right, then you let slip that it wasn't penned by him. Either way, I still like the E63, go figure.

I recall reading that BMW has no plans for a minivan. Their rationale is that it does not fit into the ultimate-driving-machine scheme of things. Curious how the SUV does. I love the marketing spin. They call their clientele knowledgeable technophiles, yet treat them like simpletons when dishing out the BS.

merc1, you alluded to the M3 yesterday. I test drove an 03 M3 convertible with SMG last month in search for a third-car toy. It was appealing since my wife was interested in the 330cic and doesn&#146;t like the manual tranny. Figured I could kill two birds&#151;she&#146;d get her 3, I&#146;d get a rocket. Bottom line is that I didn&#146;t care for the SMG. In both auto and manual modes the gear transitions were jolting, as if some car hit you in the rear with every shift. Also those 18-inch low-profile tires on top of that suspension are murder on NY metro roads&#151;extremely rough ride. Handsome car though. 04 is the last opportunity for &#147;old-world&#148; 3-lovers... get &#145;em while you can.

I can&#146;t wait to see what the next M5 will do for enthusiasts besides raising more ire. They&#146;d better have 6-speed and an improved SMG. I hear the 04 SMG is improved, but if they forsake the conventional 6-speed, just add it to the list of complaints and watch the sales drop, especially with a hefty price increase. With a V-10, this baby has to be at or over $100K. This new age of power will be very interesting. I&#146;d like to know what enthusiasts are going to do with all of this muscle besides feeding their egos and swilling martinis as they admire their garage queens. I don't think BMW could give a rat's butt about M5 though. It seems platform diversity is at the core of their marketing strategy, and I believe each model will suffer at the expense of such strategy as attention per model becomes diluted."

Now I have fallen in love with the E63 6-Series in 645Ci guise with a 6-Speed (three pedal variety). Assuming that I do in fact find a 645Ci in my garage in another year or so, I suspect that I will probably still occasionally want some more power. Ditto if I ever pop for an ""M"" car.

It would be funny though to see you in another Japanese car given your German automobile patronage. But I guess the G35 could easily have been a German car.

designman,

Well I haven't driven the current generation M3 (though I was ""this"" close to doing so), but from all I've read, its the ultimate in sport and it never lets you forget it. The next M5 is going to inhale the entire segment, including the ridiculously fast E55 AMG. A V10 sounds so good to me, but the car's styling is likely to be a sticking point for most buyers. I don't think it will cost over 100K, but I'd bet on 90K with that engine and drivetrain, it's basically race car material/spec. Mercedes will no doubt tweak the E55 (could drop the SLR's engine in, its the same engine basically) and there will be a new Audi RS6 for 2006 or so.

ljflx,

When you get the chance take a look at the G35's interior, specificallly the Coupe, it is no where near being worthy of the exterior and performance this car has. Now a re-do is rumored for 2005 delaying things further. Japanese/German cars: I've always had a soft spot for Acura in particular, but the exterior of the TL is just too much of a compromise, and the G35 Coupe is the only other Japanese car in this segment that I truly like, but it's interior is an issue. I got it! Give the G35 an Acura quality interior, problem solved! The German brands are my favorites, but in my price range I'm not crazy about the C230 Sedan (interior and engine) and I don't want a 3-Series, so only the A4 qualifies. Finally they've painted the entire bottom of the A4! Now if I were shopping at the E/5/A6 level or higher nothing from Japan would even be considered.

I agree, stylewise the Phantom does beat the Maybach, but I'm not crazy out the old-style interior of the Rolls, though it is of the highest quality. With the Rolls you simply know what it is from the minute you see one, the Maybach looks too much like S-Class ran into a Lincoln. It's not an ugly car, just not 300K+ distinctive.

Overall it seems like a good car but VW missed on some basic non-automootive conveniences like cup holders, the CD player and the nav system pretty badly per the reviewer. MB can blow these things (not that they do) and still hit a homer because of their image and well established brand. VW can't. It seems that leases for this car are already heavily subsidized by VW and can be gotten at $697 per month in some areas. I know people who wish they could get $8-10k cheaper LS 430's and E-500's at that price. Heck I bet your hard pressed to get an E-320 at that price.

ljflx,

Well I've come to the like the Phaeton a good little bit, but I didn't know that massive center console didn't contain a CD player, and I didn't realize that on the A8 either until a few weeks ago. Same thing with Mercedes' CLK and C-Class, still no in-dash CD, stubborness.

I think VW should import a short wheelbase Phaeton and price it around 55K, right on top of the E500/545i/A6 4.2 etc, and keep the lwb model where it is. The car does offer value. I priced one at vw.com and came up with 76K for everything I would want in such a car, way below the S430 4Matic, 745Li, but right about even with a A8L, which begs the question ""why"" compared to the A8. The 7-Series, LS, and XJ don't have awd, the do-it-all S-Class does, but at a much higher price. The Phaeton W12 is a relative bargain compared the S600 and 760Li, but I predict they'll be precious few buyers at this level (95K) for a VW.

Dare I say it, but VW is taking the 1990 Lexus LS400 route of underpricing the car to get some market share. If the car is a hit I doubt those leases will remain that cheap, but you're the leasing expert, not me.

The dealership experience and VW's reliability are the flies in the buttermilk.

 Audi's dealerships are brand new in Chicago, all except one on the near north side of Chicago (Fletcher Jones), VW's by comparison mostly suck big time, but some that carry the Phaeton are new and/or remodeled. I guess what I'm trying to say is that there isn't a compelling reason to pick this car over the Audi if you're a VW/Audi fan. There there are the LS430 and Jaguar XJ8, which cost less in most cases.

Overall I'm pulling for the car and await the sales numbers each month. BTW, there is a pretty good discussion about the Phaeton on the Phaeton board, complete with a VW represenative.

3681,"January 26, 2004 7:20AM",ljflx,"The difference between the Lexus approach and the VW approach is that Lexus allowed the car to be as cheap as $35-36k and you could add your options. But they wouldn't let the car cross around a $42k MSRP (I'm doing this from memory so I may be a bit off vs, actual prices back then) Most of the initial LS400's went in the 38-40k range which was a great bargain. Then of course they pushed the prices up once the car was successful. They never discounted heavily off sticker to get the car moving. This is like budgeting. Better to pick the number you can make and meet or overachieve it rather than put it up high and come down with each quarterly estimate. Of course you have to be realistic about that number you can make. In the lux arena the tendency is to think that something is really wrong when you see something too heavily discounted. Remember - at this stage the perception that something is wrong to a buyer can easily be more important than the reality that the Phaeton is or may be a great car."

My biggest concerns in order are:
1.) reliability
2.) durability
3.) price
4.) ease of use
5.) aesthetics
6.) fun to drive

I know it is hard to compare apples to apples with the MB S500 and the BMW 745Li vs. the Lexus 430 given the price difference but try to come up with some comparable data outside of price.

I would also like to hear from prospective owners on dealerships that they found easy to work with, as well as those that offered competitive pricing."
3684,"January 26, 2004 8:46AM",ljflx,"Actually it is pretty easy to compare the 7, S and LS430. They are different on price but if you load up the LS430 then you are within $2-3k of an S430 with minor options and $5-6k of an S430 normally optioned. From your priority list the LS430 is likely the car for you and the S-class is second. What you can't compare either a 7 series or the LS430 to is the over the top S55amg. But otherwise the cars are very comparable.

MB dealers - seemed fine to me when I shopped in NJ in 2001 but I'd go with an exclusive MB dealer and not one that shares a location with other car models. I shopped at a combo MB/Honda (one building, two showrooms) dealership and an MB exclusive dealership and preferred the latter. Every Lexus dealership I've dealt with in the NY/NJ area pampered you and treated you like royalty. I can't say anything about MB - other than comment on sales since I didn't buy and never dealt with the service dept. At Lexus you always get an RX or ES as a loaner in my experience. At the MB exclusive dealership I would have gotten a C-class and at the combo guy I would have gotten a car from Enterprise. Lastly - I didn't feel MB or Lexus dealers exerted any pressure on the sale. It was always your choice and the dealers praised their cars and the cars of the competing brands. But I was shopping new, not pre-owned."
3685,"January 26, 2004 9:27AM",motownusa,No question about it. The Lexus is the one for you the way you described your priority. If I could afford any of these cars ( I can't) the LS430 would be my first choice.
3686,"January 26, 2004 9:53AM",sv7887,"Slicker,

Interesting post. I'd say the LS430 is the car for you. Like you, I pay Cash and don't buy often. I have a relatively trouble free 92 LS400 (Until Recently, long story) and purchased a 2002 LS430 in Sept of 2002. Both Lexus cars have been extremely reliable and never have left me stranded. The controls are easy to understand and properly placed. Operating the Navigation System doesn't require a Ph.D. I found the Lexus Console the most practically designed of the bunch.
  As for durability. The 92 LS has held up well. I've had minor issues with rattles due to some $0.10 screw missing, and a burnt out tail light at 11 years. That's about it. Of course ALL of these cars require you to follow the maintenance schedule. I've spent around $3,500 in my 12 years of ownership. I could have saved some money by sending the car to independent mechanics, but it's only seen Lexus dealers only.

Where does the Lexus lose? Aesthetics and the fun to drive category. With the exception of the first LS, the latest Lexus offerings are quite bland in design. Every new LS design seems to really make the last model look very outdated. Holding on to my LS430 for 12 years like my LS400 probably won't be possible due to this.

Their aesthetic designs age much faster than MB, due in part to their lack of originality..As for BMW, I think you've heard all the comments about the car being ""Bangled."" As for ""Fun to Drive"" the Germans have the edge. The LS430 is very comfortable to drive, and has great straight line acceleration numbers, but the German cars are far more responsive and nimble.

Finally, as for Dealers, I've always found the Lexus dealers (MA) a pleasure to work with. They've handled the extensive post accident repairs on my 1992 LS very well. The Loaner cars are always new, and the sales/service staff very professional. Everything is top notch.

My opinion is that the German cars offer a little more spice, but overall the Lexus Ownership experience cannot be beat.

Hope this helps,
SV"

By the way, thanks for all your great posts. I appreciate hearing your candid feedback.

I am 31, married with 2 kids. This is why I am looking at a full size sedan.

One other thing I have heard is that Lexus cars in general are referred to as a ""poor man's Mercedes"". Obviously everyone is going to have their own personal bias, but just wanted to verify that this specific perception is as real where I live as it is in your neck of the woods. (I don't think this point will play a huge factor in my decision, but for some reason this bias keeps coming up).

As an aside, I have test driven the BMW 745Li, but I haven't yet test driven the MB S500 or the Lexus LS430. Sounds by most of the posts so far that I should call my Lexus dealer first before I pick up the phone to my MB dealer."
3689,"January 26, 2004 1:50PM",ljflx,Everyone I know that has an LS430 can afford an S-600 if they wanted. Some MB lover somewhere started that rumor. There are also MB S500's and SL's in my area that sit on driveways of homes that are half the price of mine. To each his own on how people spend their money.
3690,"January 26, 2004 2:54PM",sysadb,"You might want to look at the Q45 also, as it meets your most important criteria.

ljflx, you are correct about the original LS400 being priced ""al-a-carte"". The 90 model had a base price of $35k, and options such as leather and sunroof were optional. You won't find too many of these cloth-seat examples around, though...

DB"
3691,"January 26, 2004 3:43PM",ljflx,I know. Even in 95 when I took my first LS400 the sunroof and other goodies were still optional. I never saw an LS400 without a sunroof and I never saw one with cloth seats in the pre 95 era. They really should just make the premium edition be the base car and put the right starting MSRP.
3692,"January 26, 2004 6:33PM",jamesfletcher2,"I subscribe to Automotive News and after reading your post I looked at this weeks Auto News issue on the Web. Here are some public links and info extracted from my subscription issue that were provided. The public links from AutoWeek (the Automotive News sister publication) have almost the exact language as the commensurate article in Automotive News.

1. Here is some of the key information from the 2007 Lexus article you mention -

""How high is high enough? How big is too big?""

""Those are the questions facing Lexus Division, which won the best-selling luxury brand title for the fourth straight year in 2003.""

""But Denny Clements, Lexus general manager, says the brand has fallen into a predictable rhythm - and he wants to change that.""

""We launch a car, then have a minor change after three years, and then a redesign two years after that,"" Clements said during an interview at the Detroit auto show.""

""Meanwhile, the Europeans have new product news and variations coming every year, and they're always on magazine covers. Lexus needs to be like that. Lexus needs to have something always going on. It needs to have that buzz.""

""Clements said Lexus and parent Toyota Motor Corp. have set this stir-things-up agenda for the next few years:

- A new distinct design specific to Lexus, to be seen first in the 2005 GS 430 and evolving from there. (Note: the article says a MY05 GS not MY06 which makes more sense like merc1 said a few days ago.)

- A redesign of each car line by spring 2007.

- All-wheel drive availability with the redesigns.

- The addition of a flagship above the LS 430.

- The creation of a factory performance division, akin to Mercedes-Benz's AMG.""

""After spending the last several years bulking up in SUVs, Lexus is returning to its core strength: luxury cars. The next-generation GS 430 and GS 300 sport sedans, which will arrive in early 2005, will be followed by the replacements for the IS 300, ES 330 and LS 430, all arriving by spring 2007.""

Very interesting, IMO.

2. Here is the Acura RL article on the AutoWeek Web site on the new RL - http://www.autoweek.com/cat_content.mv?port_code=autoweek&cat- - - - - _code=carnews&loc_code=index&content_code=01990871

3. Here is a link from AutoWeek (the Automotive News sister pub) on the ultra-luxury Cadillac that I believe we have basically seen before - http://www.autoweek.com/cat_content.mv?port_code=autoweek&cat- _code=carnews&loc_code=index&content_code=00165382

4. ON the Cadillac SUV engine initial statement from the article it goes on the say -

""The move is in keeping with General Motors' plans to create a series of exclusive high-performance cars and SUVs for Cadillac called the V Series. The first of those models, the CTS-V sports sedan, is in showrooms. The CTS-V is powered by a V-8 derived from the engine used in the Chevrolet Corvette.""

""You will find Cadillacs running around with higher-output V-8s, running around with V-10s (and) V-12s,"" Stephens says, ""and you will find even one variant with even more cylinders.""

Let me know if you want more info and I will e-mail it to you.

3693,"January 26, 2004 11:08PM",merc1,"Well thats what I basically meant, they're pricing the Phaeton below its main rival from Germany, not the actual dollar amount. Nobody can sell a car like a Phaeton or LS for 35K anymore, but for 76K pretty loaded/awd the Phaeton undercuts VW's main rival the S-Class by a huge amount. I know the numbers aren't the same when Lexus was willing to take a loss those first few years, VW isn't (and probably can't) do that.

In your other post you say that a Mercedes ""lover"" originally stated that a Lexus is a poor mans Mercedes. It's no rumor, nor does it matter who stated it, it's said because Lexus keeps making their flagship (best premier etc) car in the shadow of Mercedes' S-Class, hence the distinction. It will be denied by some until the end of time, but the LS' whole reason for being is the S-Class. No other cars in this class look alike and pattern themselves after each other like the LS does the S-Class. Lexus and only Lexus keeps imitating their nearest competitor in just about every way. BMW, Jaguar, Audi and now VW all have cars in this class, but they're very different from one another.

I know you (a LSx2 owner) and your circle can afford a S600 with no sweat, but the *average* LS430 buyer can't, especially if someone is paying cash. Doesn't the average LS sell for about 60-63k? The S600 is double that. Nothing is etched in stone here, I'm just speaking in general. The ""poor man's Mercedes"" saying probably came up too when looking at the price spread between the two cars, one starts at 55K and goes to 72K, the other starts at 73K and goes to 125K, thats a huge difference.

M"
3694,"January 26, 2004 11:39PM",merc1,"I must say I find Lexus' plans impressive on paper, but if the GS is any indication then I'm not so sure. The LF-S to GS was sort of a letdown. The LF-S is supposed to be the next IS, per autospies (I know right).

I also read where Lexus wants to sell 350K cars a year in the U.S. That would be some feat, every dealer would be able to use money to keep their fireplaces lit. Lexus has what 200 dealers, Mercedes around 300 and Cadillac has over 1200. Lexus can start printing their own money if they push 350K units out of such a small dealership body. This may be possible if the next IS has a sedan/coupe/convertible/wagon lineup like it's target 3-Series. The HPX would have to take off also. I'm not convinced the next GS will be all that more popular than the current car.

Thought I'm not so sure if the GS lineup is done just yet. They've released some detailed info on the next GS300, but I don't think the GS430 is set in stone, I can't see them NOT increasing the horsepower on the V8 GS. It could be possible that they haven't said anything yet because they don't want the current LS430 to be affected. I mean spring 2005 is quite a ways away. I also can't see them not offering awd on the V8 model, I mean Mercedes and Audi (to a lesser degree) sell a good number of awd V8 cars in snowy places where rwd is too big of a pain. Last summer when visiting Minnesota, every Mercedes I saw was a 4Matic, I mean every single one. I'm sure Florida is quite different and I've never seen a 4Matic Benz when I visit Texas so awd seems to make a difference depending on location.

Cadillac will have to put up or shut up in my book. The XLR and CTS are not the world beaters Lutz promised. The XLR while competitive, at the end of the day is still a few rungs below the SL and the CTS hasn't come close to beating the 3 or 5-Series. The V-Series cars will be good for image and those who can afford them, but what Cadillac, Acura and Infiniti for that matter needs is a attention grabbing flagship car. The new STS *so far* doesn't look like anything the E, or 5-Series should worry about. The next RL if a hybrid could be that car for Acura. The next Infiniti Q45 could be a few years off since the current model just came out for 2002.

3695,"January 27, 2004 7:36AM",edspider1,"I enjoyed reading these posts. I thought Merc1's comments were right on. I've owned MB, BMWs and Lexus. The S600 is not in my price range. The LS ultra is $70K and has more features than the S500 at $80K. I've warranty problems with both MB and BMW, but never with the LS. The Lexus experience is real. There is no going back.

Yes, MB has better styling, but only on the outside. Nothing beats the interior of an LS and that's what I see the most of. Also, the 04 LS has greatly improved the bland exterior problem.

LS is a poor man's MB. Yeah, I've heard that said, but not by those who have really studied the cars and owned them. I don't think anyone has ever thought I bought my LS because I could not afford the S. I've also heard MB is for those seeking image over value.

Slicer_3729: Everyone agrees, the LS easily is the winner in your first 4 categories, and the interior wins for your 5th. I equate fun to drive with smooth and quiet, so for me it wins that, too."
3696,"January 27, 2004 9:29AM",ljflx,I didn't mean to imply that everyone who buys an LS430 can buy an S-600. But I'd bet a very high percentage can swing an S-430 and and many of that group could get an S-500. There are plenty of people that reach high for the cars in this grouping and the group below. It's really a function of your decisions in life. In my town I'll see S-class and LS430 cars on driveways of homes that range from $500k to $5mln. You can easily see who could afford anything they want. Personally I'd finalize a great house before picking a great car. That's why I drove an Acura Legend (an excellent car but certainly not in this league) through 1994. The S-class was within my reach in 1990/91 and I also passed on the LS400 in those years until 1995. But I knew I wanted a bigger home in a different town. Built my house in 1994. It's funny how things happen. A higher auto payment may have made me take a lower priced lot. I took the more expensive lot back in 1994 bacause I had few other financial obligations. The other lot I was considering was $50k cheaper and that's $300 a month on a mortgage. Today that $50K is worth $600K. I still remember your decision a few years ago and I commend you for it.
3697,"January 27, 2004 12:29PM",lenscap,"Thanks for the article updates. It looks like Lexus will be changing quite a bit in the coming years. The article, which I finally read, mentioned the following (some of which you touched on):

1. A super-luxury Lexus above the LS is coming. Lexus says ""it's not an issue of if, but when.""

2. Lexus will create a performance division similar to Mercedes/AMG and BMW/M. According to Lexus, ""we have to have those image products.""

3. Lexus' GM says no car ""gets him more emotional than the pending redesign of the LS 430. It is more than just a redesign...it will make the same impact as the original."""

3699,"January 27, 2004 6:23PM",sv7887,"Hi all,
  Interesting comments by the Lexus GM..What's so predictable about their design change frequencies? Most European carmakers run their designs longer than Lexus. (Jaguar, MB S Class, BMW) What he's missing is lack of originality. You can debate the aesthetics all you want, but each of the Euro nameplates have their own distinctive design. Like it or not, you can't mistake a 745 for anything else. I'm glad Lexus leaning toward making a LS that rivals the original in impact..Only time will tell.

I've noticed this forum usually centers around the Lexus vs German issue. What do you all think about Jaguar? Have they finally built a worthy competitor to the Lexus, MB, and BMW? How much have they really improved on reliability?

I'm sure a high percentage of LS430 buyers can swing a S430, especially if they're leasing them. No doubt.

I've always wanted to ask what town do you live in, it sounds like quite a place the place. Probably like what Naperville IL is here.

The Acura Legend is the reason why I've always had a strong desire to own and Acura, but they just can't seem to get the styling right.

edspider1,

It really does depend on your circle or group, because to some a Lexus is just that a poor mans Mercedes, and to some it's a better car that doesn't get its just do. Since Lexus does make a great car all they'd have to do to erase that stigma is create their own styling and not follow Mercedes' every move. They probably will do the former, but the latter is just good business.

sv7887,

Ahh...Jag u wa. Yes, imo the new XJ is a full fledged member of this class. It's light and lean and is easily a styling home run. The only thing I noticed at Detriot is that it still does have anywhere near the room of say a LS430 or 745Li, so far that hasn't slowed its sales down. I'm not sure about their reliability you'll have to ask one of the survey people about that one. They only Jaguar I truly don't like is the X-Type. The XK is a modern classic. Its about the only other luxury car besides a Mercedes SL that can wear the same styling since 1997 and still look so good. Jaguar's dual-edged sword is their styling you either like it or you don't. It's either just right or way too much for some, and in the case of the old XJ it made the car very uncompetitive because it simply was too small (low roof etc) for many.

You can't build a new home here anymore unless it's at least 4300 feet or so (most are 6-10,000 these days) and it's 10 acre zoning. So the seclusion makes it a town for celebrities and athletes like.

Here is my own prejudice against MB. I have friends who are MB fanatics. They would NEVER have a ""Japanese piece of crap"". Of course all of their cars have to be ""European"". They also have a very expensive house with 100% mortgage, credit card debt, a 1995 MB S420 with a new loan on it, a boat that they have a loan on and can't afford to fix when it breaks, etc.

I, on the other hand, couldn't care less about the ""prestige"" of the car or where it came from. Reliability and Resale is key. I have a nice house with 50% equity, no credit card debt, and only pay cash for ""recreational purchases"".

Some are carefree - spending everything they have and when a job is lost the house usually has to be sold. These people tend to seek status and as such do buy lux cars and yes many of them buy a Lexus as well. So to generalize that they buy the most prestigious brand is probably over the top. It's probably the case in a higher percentage of times but trust me these people also buy Lexus, BMW, Jag etc because they all have plenty of status.

Others are more conservative and build equity in homes and businesses and build up savings. It's life and all that really matters is whether one is happy. I know plenty of rich people and many of them are not satisfied and I know plenty of lesser income people and many of them are.

The big money towns here are Colts Neck, Rumson and Holmdel and all three have some homes that price out at $10-20mln particularly Rumson because of the water. Now one guy in town would be an interesting interview. He has an SL, an SC, an LS, an S500 and an LX470. But he also has a 10 car garage in a 12,000 foot house with lifts.

3710,"January 29, 2004 4:28AM",mfullmer,"You are correct. My experience has been though, people with so-called ""European Prestige Brands"" generally (note that I used ""generally"") are more wrapped up in the ""Prestige"" of having a European car than the overall functionality. Those same friends I mentioned earlier are on their 4th LR Discovery. They keep buying them despite the awful experience they have had with them. He, in jest, always teases me about my ""American piece of junk"" Chevy Tahoe yet we are constantly taking it because it is so difficult to get into the mail-slot rear doors of his Disco. We'll see if his attitude changes when I get the LS. I have to admit my current vehicle (2001 Cadillac STS) is (soon to be was) a total piece of crap though.

I've also noticed a certain ""haughty aire"" to BMW owners (in GENERAL) on the road.

I know that my prejudice is only generalized by my experiences but I get a certain pleasure out of NOT giving in to my desire to own a ""look-at-me"" brand and choose my vehicles first and foremost on reliability.

Although - I'm thinking of getting a '99 or '00 SL to have as a weekend car. I just started warming up to that body style as the new (read: UGLY) one's came out."

I tend to agree with you, I had to overcome the same stereotype about BMW drivers myself before I bought my first one. I'm a little different from most folks though in that while I like my luxury goodies, I still want a car with a good sporting capability AND a manual transmission. Unfortunately the number of cars on the market that meet my criteria these days are few and far between, hence my move to BMW.

FWIW, even though I'm doing the ""European Prestige"" thing, I have all of my credit cards paid off, my home has an LTV of less than 50%, and even though my kids are only 10 and 7, their college funds are already capable of getting them through their undergraduate degrees.

I've also noticed that BMW owners put more miles on their cars than other marques. Could it be there is something to the ""ultimate driving machine"" other than fluff, image and arrogance?

Besides, BMW is no longer a ""look at me"" brand and I'm not sure it ever was. There's some serious ugly going on there. Buyers are turning their backs on the look so it's all about function now&#151;the ride. Any ""prestige"" that comes with it is icing on the cake.

There are airs with all luxury marques BMW included, but for most BMW buyers it goes a little deeper and I would think that anyone who doesn't understand this never drove a BMW."

Merc1 - The A8 just never cut it in the NYC and south of NYC area. But go northeast of NYC to Conneticut and you'll see a decent amount of them. When I looked at the A8 in 2001 the local dealership - which was an awful place - told me they get 4 A8's a month and they were discounting heavily without me negotiating. When I test drove the car a few months back nothing had changed. I'm sure a few are sprinkled around but with the local dealership (and it's a small one which also sells Range Rovers) selling so few it's easy to see why they are so rare around here."

3715,"January 29, 2004 11:07AM",ljflx,Anyone who can afford these cars likely has a car that has AWD or has an SUV particularly in the cold climates. If a need for a third occasional vehicle is there you can pick up a cheap suv or even lease a grand cheroee for under $300 a month. It's not mandatory at all. S-class AWD's are low sellers and A8 sales are typically 2000 a year in all of the US. A bit higher now because of the new model but it will revert right back. If I was an S-class buyer I'd stick with the base car and buy an extra suv that is cheap for the lease price difference. While I hope Lexus comes out with AWD I also hope it's optional.

It was built as an Acura dealer (the very first in Chicagoland), and then about 10 years ago Audi moved in and Acuras and Audis were sold side-by-side. Just recently, Acura moved out and built a spanking-new building right next door. Even though it is next door it is in Morton Grove and not Glenview.

When the Audis and Acuras were together potential customers would go in the back and talk to the mechanics to see which were better cars from a reliability standpoint. Of course, the mechanics said the Acuras required far less maintenance. I guess they wanted to separate the two brands to ""protect"" Audi and that may be why Acura moved out."

I'm sure Acura took more than their fair share of Audi intenders when the sticker prices were looked at.

Well thats still a good amount when you're talking about less than 25K cars, especially for such a pricey car to start with. For the E-Class it will be even higher this year, 4Matic E's are an hot item. I have the MT issue. Honestly I'm tiring of MT, their writing is so high-school and it's always the Corvette, Mustang type rhetoric month in and month out. No sophistication at all. England's CAR magazine has more in one issue than about 5 of Motor Trend's. Though I do like MT's comparos (sometimes) and it's always fun to read what they *think* the future cars are going to be.

I have to admit that in the Washington DC area, BMW used to be exclusive and I felt a little special because of the hood ornament. With BMW selling over 225,000 cars and SAV's in the US per year, it seems like everyone is driving one.

They are growing sales because they offer a great product with a great reputation. BMW's receive praise from car magazines and every road test for performance sedans is titled ""BMW Beater??? Then you read the test and the conclusion is: close but not a BMW beater. Even the conservative mag Consumer Reports pronounced the 530i the best car they have ever tested.

I've been looking for a replacement for my current 7 series and when I test dive the Lexus, Merc, Phaeton, Audi, Infiniti, I get back in my car and drive away knowing that I'm already in the best car.

3724,"February 1, 2004 8:17PM",i_drive,"I've been at the Porsche Cayenne forum lately (just took home a new Cayenne Tiptronic V6 yesterday!). You guys talk A LOT within a week!

So far, we like the Cayenne so much we don't want to give it to our daughter (supposed to be a birthday gift in about 2 weeks). according to plan, I want to get my wife a Cayenne S, but we've been quite pleased actually with the performance of the Cayenne V6 (but noticibly weaker than the S model). the only problem; we've got this one in black and it takes in dust WITHIN SECONDS, literally. So I always have to wipe it. And guess what? All of our cars are black. Black S430, Black (metallic) SL55, Black Cayenne, and soon-to-be black Cayenne S. Drives a lot of our neighbors crazy.

So, what's up with this NavUp programme? My 2002 S430 has CD-based GPS, and look at what it says:

(@ mbusa.com...)

CD Navigation - Model Year 2004 C-Class, CLK-Class, G-Class, SL-Class.
(Also available for prior model year vehicles with CD or DVD navigation)

------------------------------------

I don't understand that. It says 'also avaliable for prior model years WITH CD or DVD navigation.'

Does this mean that a CD-based Navigation can use DVD-CD's? I highly doubt that, but if that's the case, I'll send it asap to my MB dealer. Because all I can say is that the '02 COMMAND GPS system was one of the worst introduced (actually, the Cayenne's is THE worst)

Mercedes-Benz of Laguna Niguel has a lot of Maybach's in the showroom. Stopped by there last weekend to service the car, and I'm honestly quite surprised about the close-resemblance to the '04 S-Class. A bit too close, in my opinion. But, I've seen one, Maybach (the 57 model) cruising along Pearl Ave. in Downtown La Jolla. I think it was some desert-silver color, close to the designo silver offered on the S-Class. It was an rather old gentleman, about 60 something. The car zipped along quite fast, which was interesting considering the gigantic size of that monster.

i've also heard from my salesperson at MB of LN that the next-generation S-Class will look very similar to the Maybach- not too sure I'll like that, but time will tell..."

I hope the next S doesn't look like the Maybach, but some of the spy photos and drawings are pointing in that direction, with the rear of the next S having a similar design. One thing the next S should have a Maybach level interior, with an all new look.

I read your post on the LS board, and yes you're right the HPX doesn't look anything like the FX. I'm not sure what I said back then based on pictures, but after actually seeing it I agree that it doesn't look like the Infiniti FX. I think some may have got it twisted by thinking just because the HPX was rumored to be launched because of the FX, they convinced themselves that it also looked like it??

Naturally I totally disagree with the notion of a S600 being a ""total ripoff"" because it looks like the other S-Class models. The S600's power and command of the road is unmatched by anything from Japan. Only Audi's A8L 6.0 W12 looks any different from the basic A8, nobody else does different body work for their V12s or top line cars either.

If you look purely at materials costs (and you can get and idea just from looking at the weight of the V12 vs V8 car) there shouldn't be a huge difference in that aspect. What you are paying for is development costs being spread out over a smaller number of units, plus higher (probably much higher) manufacturer profit margins on the V12 version.

Put another way, if it costs an extra 40k to get a car that goes 0-60 in 5sec rather than 6, and an extra 200k to get one that goes in 4sec, and an extra 1mm to get to 3sec...well, even people who can afford to spend 300k or 1mm or whatever on a car aren't necessarily going to do so.

Ripoff - is maybe too strong a word but the S600 price is about $20k too high in my opinion.

While many people do buy Mercedes just for the ""flash"" value, many others do not. My girlfriend's father is about as non-flashy as you can get (a very good thing in my mind), and he owned an SL600 that he bought new in the mid-90s.

For instance, if I were in a position to invest people&#146;s money I&#146;d feel a lot better soliciting clients in a Mercedes or BMW than a Honda. Kind of gives them some confidence in your abilities, no? I&#146;m not saying it should be a smokescreen to cover up any shortcomings, but it does tend to say &#147;I made money and can help you do the same.&#148;

That said, there are also people who are NOT pretentious who buy solely for performance, reliability and comfort. Lots of types out there no big deal. The only problem I see is with those who buy for status and can&#146;t afford it. These people are to be pitied and are a danger to themselves.

IMHO real business people, not the clowns you see on TV or in the Robb Report, who are building a business don't buy luxury consumption goods; rather they invest in their business. A lease payment of 2K per month on an S Class or better is foolishness to them. A stock broker with an S Class is a stock broker without profitable investment ideas.

Professionals (e.g., physicians, CPAs, lawyers, entertainers, etc.) usually come out of a more academic background. They are not only not constantly weighing the pros and cons of alternative investment ideas, they also usually lack the ability to put more capital to work in their business (i.e., their practice). As a result they are more susceptable to the lures of luxury goods like 15K watches and 100K sedans. (Some professionals have real vision however and do have an active, self-managed investment portfolio. Maybe they buy the building where their practice is located or make other investments. This is rare though. Most can't spend it fast enough and at 65 have little to show for a lifetime of high income.)

The serious business people in New England that I know drive AWD Denalis, XC Volvos, and three year old Exploders. etc. They go in early and stay late, no matter what the weather. And they wear a black sport watch not a (fake) gold Rolex like a sales manager at a domestic car store. So if they bang it on a Bridgeport or when they are working-out they just buy another Timex.

BLOCKISLANDGUY, sorry to hear you have Mercedes S owners pegged as losers. This includes my boss so I&#146;ll start right at home with my stories. My boss is very successful. In addition to his S he has two Porsches. Neither one of us are pretentious, but let&#146;s face facts, there&#146;s a living to be made out there with multi-million dollar accounts being awarded to capable businesses. When successful, well-paid clients are being driven to lunches and country clubs in Benzes as opposed to diners in Accords, I wonder which scenario REINFORCES the perception of a company&#146;s capabilities. Want to deny this, vilify this? Be my guest. Also, my boss and I know a thing or two about working through lunches, late nights and weekends... seems we invented it. No sir, no money trees growing wild in our offices... we till the land and take the crop to harvest with a lot of sweat just as many other successful businesses with Mercedes-driving owners do. By the way, I don't wear a watch, but I've heard of people wearing $30,000 Breguets who donate wings to hospitals and schools. Why no watch? I just got sick of breaking and replacing them ;-)

""It's far too off topic - but just for the heck of it - what products are sold by people from their cars? I exclude NYC where you can buy a suite of electronic products while you are trying to get into the Holland tunnel.""

LJFLX, I hope you don&#146;t think I was talking about peddling sundries on the street from the trunk of a car. As you probably are aware, the term ""product"" ranges from a stick of bubble gum up to high-end services offered by billion-dollar corporations. Care to venture how much ""product"" has ever been discussed on a golf course with a Mercedes waiting in the parking lot? Advertising services, IT services, music, insurance, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals... I&#146;m sure you know the story. Furthermore, I have made it a point to ask many people with high-end luxury vehicles what their cars mean to their businesses. Few claim their car affects their businesses directly, but ALL say they believe it projects an image of success, hence CAPABILITY to their clients.

_______

In conclusion, discussing performance and specs is one thing, but ""High End Luxury Marques"" and image is as ""on topic"" as it gets, as was your discussion about cars and affluent neighborhoods. Sorry but you can&#146;t avoid it, from pimping to legitimate business deals, wherever there is money at stake, image and luxury cars are usually somewhere in the equation. What&#146;s more, you guys know it.

3755,"February 8, 2004 6:31AM",designman,"Ljflx, I hear you and respect where you&#146;re coming from. I have a lot of stories though.

There&#146;s this very successful man who is a legend in my field. He&#146;s a real good golfer and is known for his ability to entertain clients and prospective clients. It is said that in the summer he is almost never in the office... has clients/prospects on the golf course every day of the week, wining, dining. Naturally, a couple of Mercedes are in the picture.

I had done business with his major client in the past when they were the major client of a company I had worked for years ago. These people were impressed by opulence and very competitive with each other... part of their company culture.

One day one of them decided he wanted to live out a fantasy by getting a limo, then walking along Central Park while the limo heeled along side of him at 2 mph. The story got back to the client office. Next thing you know, all of the VPs (and there were lots of them) were arranging frivolous business trips to NYC so they could do the same.

Sound ridiculous? You bet it is. And for the winer-diner low-handicap-golfer Mercedes-driving businessman, clients like these are what he preys upon. Sure enough, he eventually landed that big fish. You can push his Mercedes as far in the background as you&#146;d like, but it&#146;s all part of the act.

Now, of course I can&#146;t disclose the client, but trust me, anyone who is out there reading this... you paid for those Mercedes and the Central Park strolls with limo at hand, not to mention the scalper-rate theatre tickets and dinners at the Manhattan Ocean Club.

I am fully aware that not everyone wants a luxury car to impress others, but fact is, many many people do. I could write a book about this. If you want to hear more stories just let me know. I would especially delight in telling you about those who I have asked directly ""What does your car mean to your business?""

Yes and others wear jewlery to impress and others wear jeans. In the past I worked in an institution that catered to well-heeled inviduals. I could tell stories like designman has. The only commanlity between the stories is they go to both extremes, from those who use expensive and guaudy items to prove something, to those who wore ripped jeans to blend in with the homeless. In the middle, the average client of the instutitino payed for it all. Designman is right, we all pay for this stuff. Unless you're a gazillionare.

But at any rate, non of this has anything to do with 0-60."

None of your posts rebutting my statement bring a case that people who are concerned with value would choose a $89,000 Mercedes Benz over a $70,000 Lexus (which has more features, luxury and better reliability, depreciation).

The majority of you were talking about FLASH, which was exactly what I stated.

3758,"February 8, 2004 9:28AM",ljflx,"The reason is really twofold - 1. that there are many people who refuse to accept that the Japaneses have rivaled, and in some cases exceeded the Europeans in building certain cars; 2. - There are people that believe the more expensive car has to be better or they just want to be seen in the most expensive car of a certain class.

Now there are other reasons that can come into play of course but they speak to the person who is buying the car for the true automotive desire and experience. I love the Lexus LS430 because it offers what I seek the most in a car. But if my preference was more for a handling car you couldn't fault me or anyone else for going with a 7-series. MB still offers things that no one has and will custom tailor a car better than anyone thus nothing wrong with going with them. Some also may feel that the S-class is the safest car on the road.

The Lexus NEVER had a repair issue...just normal maintenance. Have had the 7 series for 2 weeks. It has stalled twice and the dashboard lit up the first time I took it on the highway with a flat tire warning. I already have an appointment for repairs and it doesn't have 200 miles on it yet.

I hope this is it. I read that the iDrive issues were resolved. I hope this is not an indication of things to come.

My initial impressions are that the Lexus is a better car regardless of price. The standard Lexus seats were more comfortable than the optional comfort seats in the BMW. The Mark Levinson stereo was much better sounding than the optional upgraded BMW stereo. Even the sound of the doors closing was nicer in the Lexus. I don't get it. If it wasn't for the larger back seat in the BMW, I would be really regretting my decision."
3760,"February 9, 2004 12:30AM",merc1,"Fresh from the show floor, just a few hours ago!

In an earlier post I mentioned that I received an invite from Maserati to see their cars up close and personal.

What an experience! I'll start with the Maseratis, but please remember that Maserati's owner is Ferrari and their cars were in same section! More on that in a moment.

The Maserati Quattroporte feels custom made for me. It's a real intimate car with a very sporty personality, kinda like a 4-door coupe. The seats are similar to BMW's ""sport"" seats, confining for some, just right for others (me). The car here, as opposed to Detroit was a shade of silver, with a beige interior. Really gorgeous. Custom luggage, check. F1 style transmission, check. They have a display with all the different shades of leather and wood types, man this car is like a blank canvas. The little lever for Reverse looks really weird, not in a bad way, just in a way that makes you think something is missing....i.e. a real gear shift. Then you see the little shift levers behind the steering wheel.

The Maserati Spyder is my second favorite in the lux-roadster class, at least based on everything except driving it. I still want a SL500 first, but then a Spyder. Interior wise it's pretty much the same as the Quattroporte. Custom interior tailoring is the catch phrase for any Maserati. They'll wrap any and everything in the softest of leathers and/or real suede, even the roll-bars.

FERRARI........Ferrari...............Ferrari

The only thing was the wouldn't open these! Nobody there could get them to open the cars. I guess them being actual customer cars had something to do with it huh?

I finally got to see the new 612 Scagletti up close an in a lighter color than the Detroit car. It's gorgeous. The 360 Modena was conspicuous by it's absence. Ferriari's best looking car is still the 575M Maranello. Such a brutal 2-seater.

All in all this made the Chicago show more memorable, but the Detroit show is still by far the best. Lamborghini and Rolls-Royce didn't officially come to Chicago, but Shell did have a Phantom and Gallardo on display.

I still don't like the Bentley Continental GT, though everyone else did.

I noticed also that here as opposed to Detroit, certain cars are not open for sitting. Porsches are typically locked, except for the Cayenne, but here they were locked also. This cut down on the traffic in their section dramatically.

The VW Phaeton was on a turntable, and there was no Audi A8L 6.0 W12.

I also noticed that the displays here are much smaller than Detroit's, even thought McCormick Place is much larger than Detroit's Cobo Hall. Interesting.

That's partially because no S-Class owners posted, at least any of the usual ones that post here from time to time.

Secondly, like I said before Value is what you ""value"" in a car, not that cheaper/more/less stuff, that doesn't always apply to cars costing 70K+ as none of the cars at this level are really a true ""value"" by original definition of the word. None of these cars are needed! When people shop at this level they pretty much know or have an idea of what they like and want, true value in this class is about as personal as personal can get. The things you listed are not the total experience nor do they comprise what every one values in a car of this type. You can't make such a broad generalization about every S-Class buyer, because surely every Lexus LS buyer isn't a wannabe Mercedes owner either.

It appeared just before I saw merc1's review from Chicago and especially his time with the Quattroporte. I found the following quote very interesting ""... Maserati is gunning for BMW. When designing the Quattroporte, the company hoped to emulate the driving dynamics of BMW's M5 sedan and the content and features of BMW's 7-series sedan"".

I recall showing a picture of the Quattroporte to my wife asking her opinion when it first appeared in Automobile Magazine a few months ago. Of course, since she is from Italy, I was somewhat stacking the deck."

I really concur with ljflx! He gets right to the point of how hard it is to leave Lexus once you have purchased/leased a new Lexus (however, I have to limit my experiences to the V8 rear-wheel drive models like the LS and GS).

I made a post on this thread a while back where I focused on the ""true cost"" of the ownership experience which I believe is far more important than the actual price of the vehicle.

I suspect that you will get your entire purchase price back minus some possible usage (although I would fight that assumption). If it is not heading in that direction, my advise would be to retain an attorney that specializes in Lemon Law cases.

Best of luck.

When do your dealership sources and readings indicate that we will see the next entirely new LS? Based on your post, it appears that you are expecting to trade the LS you are ordering on the next new LS in March 2007.

Are you expecting the new LS to hit dealers in OCtober 2006? I can not seem to get a real handle on exactly when to expect it. The only firm knowledge seems to be that the new GS will be in dealer showrooms in January 2005.

As I had mentioned before, I am waiting on the new one to replace the LS I have but my wife also like the pictures of the new GS.

Thanks,

3766,"February 9, 2004 12:59PM",edspider1,"My friend got one of the new 7 series and it has been in the shop several times, too. I had an MB which was out of service for 40 days while they replaced the engine block. The car was only 4 months old. I wasn't too impressed with the honda civic they loaned me during the repairs. My next car was a Lexus and like so many on this thread, I can't imagine considering a BMW or MB anymore. My LS is 3 years now and I just ordered a second. There were no other models to consider.

I think the durability and quality of MB and BMWs has declined in the last few years. Both in their cars and in their service. If you find a problem with your Lexus, the dealer will bend over backwards to keep you happy. They can afford to - it doesn't happen very often."
3767,"February 9, 2004 1:25PM",syswei,"A very sad tale. Hopefully BMW will buy your car back and you can get some other brand. One striking thing about your post was ""The wait for service if one wishes to have a loaner car is several weeks."" At my local Lexus dealer, they were out of loaner cars for me once and they just picked up the phone and rented a car for me for a day. It was a Camry from the Toyota dealer down the street, but better than nothing.

There was a more funny than sad annecdote on this board some weeks ago...a ML owner had both bumpers fall off the vehicle after running it through a carwash!"
3768,"February 9, 2004 1:27PM",syswei,I don't think there is any hard info or even reliable rumor on the next gen LS. Clement said recently the whole line would be new by Spring 2007. A reasonable expectation for the LS would be sometime between fall 2005 and fall 2006.
3769,"February 9, 2004 2:23PM",ljflx,"I fully expect the next gen LS will be a 2007 model and will be available in Oct 2006 - at the latest. My sales guy told me I'm on the perfect 3 year plan right now for always getting the latest significant changes. But Lexus is getting aggressive in their roll-out plans for this new LFS design and I think they just want to get it over with for the LS,IS and ES ASAP. Toyota's financial resources are sky high right now so they can do almost any aggressive move they want to. So I would not be surprised if the new LS is available as early as the Spring of 2006 as a 2007 model. I don't think they want the S-class to have a one year lead anymore and with BMW shooting themselves in the foot this is becoming an LS vs S battle in the long run. The Maserati won't cut it here in my opinion and whatever it does will likely hurt BMW and Jaguar.

Speaking oof Jaguar - a business acquaintence had to have his transmission replaced in the fall. After a lot of negotiations with Jaguar they cut him a deal that allowed him to only pay for the labor (about $1200) as the car was about a year past warranty. This was a classy act by Jaguar as the transmission cost over $9k. But he only had 30k miles on the car. Now the car died on him again and is in the shop for 10 days. His comment to me last week was ""I never had a problem with a Jaguar until I bought one"". He's had numerous minor problems before but now he is flat out disgusted. What is with these European cars?"
3770,"February 9, 2004 6:57PM",ljflx,"I did get Automobile today and saw that GS comment. The car does look sleek in the picture they show. What is a bit confusing is that it seems AWD may only be put on the V-6 but maybe Automobile got it wrong.

Next to it is the story about the 12cyl A8. I must say I think the Germans have lost their minds with these rocket power engines. The V-8 power and 23mpg I get in the LS430 with a 6.5 second 0-60 is more than sufficient and is a beautiful blend of power and good gas mileage. These super powerful engines are putting excess on top of excesses and you hardly ever need or can use the power anyway. The German carmakers would serve themselves a lot better to invest in building the cars better and improving their reliability problems. I'm also no fan of Audi's new corporate grill. The one on the current A8 is bold and beautiful and should be left alone.

The funny story in automobile is on page 34 where they accuse VW of copying the Lexus HPX style with its possible future C1 hatchback. Now I must say I like this C1 Crossover but that is most likely because I like the HPX so much - and it is a copy."
3771,"February 9, 2004 10:36PM",merc1,"The VW is merely a drawing at this point and that drawing looks nothing like the raised HPX, but already its a copy. Only because they mentioned Lexus would anyone on this board think that. The C1 crossover is similar to a Mazda 3 five-door or the old Saabs that had 5-doors in concept/layout, not a high-riding wagon trying to be a SUV like the HPX. Automobile gives pure speculation about styling they don't even know about yet and they're so right, but when they said the LF-S had a lot of 5-Series in it's make up they were oh so wrong. Right.

Every writeup about the new GS states that awd will only be offered on the V6 GS300 model.

The Maserati Quattroporte is a niche player, they aren't going for volume like the S/LS/7.

Merc1 - Sorry - It looks an awful lot like the HPX to me - in the picture - right down to the headlights.

Maserati - smart move to only make 1500 or so a year since it is probable that a larger volume will run into sales problems. But if they prove the car and then crank up the volume it can be a different story. I don't know if they have the resources for much more volume thus I don't get the the story of how they are going after a very resourceful BMW. 1500 sales a year is a change in the rounding after the decimal point when those sales ""take aways"" are distributed."

  This horsepower race is absolutely befuddling to me. I don't think the average buyer cares whether the car can do 0-60 is 5.6 sec rather than 6.3. I use my LS cars for commuting, not racing. I wouldn't be terribly inclined to buy any upcoming V-12..I live in New England, where am I going to use all that horsepower?

 I was happy with the amount of power my 92 LS has. I don't mind the extra 40 horsepower my 02 has, but it's not really necessary. Both cars can easily do 90+ MPH on the interstate, so that's good enough for me.

I hear you all on Gas prices. I always wait for ""Super Tuesday"" or some other gas station promotion to save a few cents per gallon..Not that it makes a big difference, but I guess it's a psychological effect of paying a lower price.

Any idea on what a hybrid LS would offer in MPG?

SV"
3776,"February 10, 2004 12:02PM",ljflx,I don't really care if they tweak the HP up to 340 or even 360 but don't make it a high priority and don't compromise gas mileage. HP at 400+ is for bragging purposes and is pure wasted excess. All it does is get a bunch of writers at the automags and the hardcore enthusisast excited. As a car buyer I couldn't care less as long as there is enough power and the LS430 is plenty long on power with excellent torque. I'm glad to see the hynbrids add power but at realistic levels.
3777,"February 10, 2004 6:02PM",johncalifornia,"Wow, what a bunch of fuddy-duddys on this board!

Yes, I checked the board name twice and it still reads ""High End Luxury Marques"". But the posts go on about new models having ""too much power"" and how fuel economy is a greater priority to the writers. I think this attitude goes to show how different the people who populate car forums are from the great majority of people who buy the cars.

Since the 1930s, power has been a defining characteristic of a luxury car. Today's luxo-bombs are getting pretty heavy. Three hundred horsepower is about entry-level for moving around a full-sized Jag/Merc/Lexus or BMW. Four hundred horsepower is NOT excessive when it can be managed with traction control and in some cases 4WD.

But more to the point, I'm not about to tell anybody their car is too expensive, or has too much power, or uses too much fuel, or whatever. Decisions about what's too much vs. what is just enough are subjective.

As a general convention, though, I'm like most people who really buy ""high end luxury marques"". I'll take my luxury car (in my case a Jaguar XJ8) with all the ponies the manufacturer is kind enough to install. As the French philosopher once said, ""A little too much is just enough for me."""

3781,"February 10, 2004 8:11PM",ljflx,"I'm amazed at this. Have driven many a benz - I never got that driving experience any of you talk about. So I must not know what I am missing but I've long been convinced it's psychological. Since I owned a Porsche in the past I think I know a thing or two about road feel. The S500 I drove didn't feel all that different than the LS430 I have. It just didn't ride as well or feel as luxurious inside and I hardly trust its reliability. The S430 engine indeed felt underpowered (though I'm sure it was fine for the old E-class) and the S500 engine was excellent. Last time I looked these two V8's represent 90% of MB's V8 sales here. One has the tiniest of an edge over an LS430 V8 on paper (on the road I couldn't possibly tell) and the other falls short.

I think the point is missed on power. 0-60mph in 6 secpnds with powerful torque is plenty good. Getting more power than that in a few too many hands becomes dangerous. There was an incident in London that proves that out. If MB can build a better car rather than focus on more powerful engines for those handful of cars they make them for than maybe I can really consider buying one in the future. Until then I'll stay with Lexus."
3782,"February 10, 2004 8:25PM",pablo_l,"My personal experience: I found the 370hp on the XJR I owned a total waste. I bought the car for the looks (less chrome, sportier stance compared to the XJ8) rather than horsepower. First of all, there is the highway Gestapo in CA. I don't enjoy traffic school. You drive a car like that just like you would drive a 50hp Ford Festiva.

Moreovoer, that HP is only made feasible through electronic gadgetry that increasingly isolates the driver from the real driving experience, in my opinion.

On the more radical new teutonic horsepower wave, there are drawbacks, espeically on California roads: either the drivetrain durability is compromised by being exposed to massive power and especially torque, or the dramatic addition to unsprung mass due to the strengthening of everything does not do the driving experience many favors - I have been on both an Audi RS6 and the new Merc E55, and was not particularly impressed with the driving feel: if that's how things are going to be, I'd rather have fun in a Mini with sports package, and save myself about a cool $50k.

I am with those who say that something in the tuetonic horsepower race is an odd disconnect. as a rule, luxury sedan buyers dont give a damn, and more extreme sportscar purists wouldn't be caught dead in a 4 door.

I also must note that, despite not being a pennypincher, I was put off by 13mpg and $2200 tire bills every 10k miles on the XJR. If a car is going to be high maintenance, I'd rather have more pedigree on the table than a 4 door sedan package. Ergo the 90s Corniche I got as a collectionist-extravagant drive."
3783,"February 10, 2004 8:53PM",lexus0622,"""like 13mpg and $2,200 tires every 10K.""

Pablo, I strongly suspect that most, if not all, of us do care about $2,200 tires every 10K (even if that was just for dramatic effect). Being able to afford the high-end car should not mean that one is willing to just throw money away (at least I hope not).

The point you make about the (im)practicality of HP run amok on U.S. roads is undeniable. Even if you put the leopard on a track from time to time, you will eventually want to go straight ahead at some point.

But the attraction is sooooooo irresistable! Why do we do it? Why do we struggle between the head and the heart, only to exchange the exhilaration of anticipation with post-purchase remorse? Who the heck knows! But we do it, over and over again.

Got a few extra HPs? Sure, throw 'em in!

Five switched to Lexus (all LS430's, one bought BMW (a 5 series from an E; the 5 is indeed a great car) and another bought a Jaguar XKE (found the SL just too expensive and not worth it). One renewed an MB S-class lease and the other two are long-term owners who switch cars every 6-8 years. The allure isn't so strong here.

The S-class is an excellent car but falls short in the areas that count most for me. It has a great ride but the LS430 ride (an absolute critical item for me) has a better one. The S doesn't have as high quality an interior as the LS (another critical one), and it doesn't have the body build of an LS430 (still another critical one). It's not that any of thse things are bad on the S-class but if its the most expensive car than it should have the best build and be the most bulletproof. The reliability of course is a major consideration and the Lexus is a sureshot. Ultimately luxury is reliability combined with the big three items I just noted - for me - it might be different for someone else. Power is a given at these prices so the ultimate luxury is to not have to worry about the car going to the shop.

Carnaught who posts here often is one and says great things about both brands. I stopped to think that my post 4100 was really about family and closer friends and alluded to the primary cars.

The guys I know more closely that swapped out of MB all had a Japanese second car - either an MDX, an ES300, an LX470 or an RX. So this buyer group is hardly exclusive which makes this battle all the more ludicrous.

Ray Catena - my local dealer is a big-time guy that sells both cars plus Jaguar and others. He has the biggest MB dealership in NJ (and one of the biggest in the Northeast) and his Lexus dealership just surpassed his MB dealership in sales for the first time. In fact he is opening a second Lexus dealership right next to a local MB dsealership. He couldn't care less which car you buy so long as you buy it from him. Walk into his MB dealership and they rave about Lexus if you bring it up and vice-versa if you walk into the Lexus shop."

I own the MB because it's a weekend driver and I have had my share of problems with it (Electrical is all - MB DOES have problems with electrical!). But I do love it.

My current sedan right now is a '01 STS that I've had problem after problem with and can't wait to turn in next weekend! I also have a Chevy Tahoe LT. (Not one problem in 9500+ miles!)

The saddest thing and what makes me never want another MB (for driving every day) is that, even on Spring or Autumn days when it would be fun to drive the SL - The electrical problems (roof) I've had proclude me from doing so. Sure, it's still under warranty but that makes no difference when a pop-up thunderstorm comes along and your roof is open but can't close it.

It's too bad such a marvelous car like the SL is beset by those problems. I have my eyes on the SL and I hope they clean-up these problems. Like you I'd use it as a toy car and hold it real long-term. But I love the SC430 as well and I've always loved the Jaguar XK. Can't go wrong with any of the three and since it's not an everyday car the reliability isn't as weighty. But you can bet your life the SC430 will be the most reliable. The guy with the transmission problem I mentioned in an earlier post has the XK. My neighbor also has a new XK (came out of the old S-class) in a gorgeous mint green color. He's the guy that thought the SL was overpriced. His kids are grown and he no longer needed a big sedan. So far it's been a letter perfect car."

Both cars are very similar-and as I rarely if ever get to be in the passengers seat--I looked around. To me the Mercedes is very nice and comfortable. I like the seat adjuster better than the LS. Also the headrest adjusts out from the bottom to really give your neck support. The feel of the ride is no different to me. I liked the different look, just because it was different.

As we were tooling along, up comes a Bentley. It was the four door sedan, and the wheels and tires really are large. A stately ride, but to my tastes the wheels were out of balance.

My friends that own S Mercedes can afford anything they want, and have earned that right.. They seem happy with their choices and largely havebeen repeat buyers. I have stuck with Lexus, and because of the quality will probably continue to do so. It would be nice to have a change sometimes, but it would have to be in the right direction.

Still, I acknowledge that most owners LOVE their XJRs, and some want to make them go even faster!

High-end cars are about wish fulfillment, and the XJR is not a bad car or a dumb car simply because I do not want one. If I branded the XJR as excessive, what's to stop the Camry driver from labelling my XJ8 the same way?

Pathdoc: Isn't being a Euro-car snob getting to be hard work these days? Sure, the Lexus brand is not for enthusiasts, but that in no way diminishes what Toyota has accomplished in creating this car. They have simply manufactured the most comfortable and reliable car ever built, and at a very reasonable cost.

Do you think Asian car manufacturers are no less motorheads and performance-oriented than Germans or Italians? Take a Mazda RX-8 for a drive and get your consciousness raised!

Toyota could have made the Lexus just as much an Autobann stormer as any BMW or Mercedes ever was, but they wisely understood that the vast majority of U.S. luxury car owners are not interested in Z-rated apex strafing. (Americans like horsepower, though, so Lexus are always competitive in that area!)

Edspider: Just because somebody is dumb enough to pay $55K for a Lincoln LS does not qualify that car to join the ranks of Lexus and the Germans. Read the car magazines and notice where the LS invariably finishes: at the bottom of the heap.

There's nothing I'd like more than an American car that kicks German butt, but as long as GM and Ford are run by eunuchs, that isn't gonna happen. (Are those Harely Earl commercials for Buick pathetic or what? Having to reach back 50 years to find a real car guy in your company.)

On top of that it seems they are going to blur the S-class and the Maybach with the next gen S-class. Some already think it is blurred. It seems they are searching for an answer.

I'm really curious about this ""body build"" you mentioned, that is so superior on the LS vs the S-Class. Care to explain that?

There are no blurred lines right now between the Maybach and the S-Class, but the spy people are saying the next S will look similar. I'm not sure what I think of that just yet. If they can make the next S look better than the current car (hard to do imo) while picking up something from the Maybach, then do it, everyone knows the Maybach is a W140 S-Class revisted anyway. If it's going to be a Maybach clone I'll be in Germany protesting....lol.

Most come to realize the best is often not the most expensive. No one ever raved about how great the MB drove - just that it was a good car but not as good as in the past. The ""lifetrime"" MB guys who switched all complained about the deterioration of quality.

Mfullmer - That's a bad dealership - probably without much competition around. The MB sales guys in my neck of the woods were more congenial and it was more of a Lexus type experience for me. Those I know never spoke badly of their dealership experience. That was one bombastic salesman. Wasn't he smart enough to realize he was putting down the car?? .... Have you ever seen the LS430 in Cypress pearl?"
3803,"February 12, 2004 8:05AM",mfullmer,"I'm getting the Moonlight Pearl with the Ultra Lux package and Ecru Nappa leather interior. I'm supposed to hear when it is going to be in port this week but nothing yet.

I do love to drive my SL on the weekends, especially in the Spring and Autumn here in Atlanta. I've even been known to drive it in the summer with the top down and the A/C blasting - that system rocks, you could freeze a hunk of beef with it!

The biggest problem is when I go to put the top up or down. I usually take the hard top off in March or so but I keep the soft top up in the Garage when it is parked. Every time I go in there to put the roof down and drive it I get this nervous sick feeling, especially if someone is with me. I get the same feeling when I go to put it up. I've stopped putting it up when I'm parked because several times it has malfunctioned then - now that's embarrassing.

The worst part of all is the dealership. I've never, ever seen such pompous jerks in my life! I actually got into it with one of the salesmen one day when I was there having the roof looked at. I was talking to one of the other customers there waiting that I would probably be getting rid of it before the warranty was up because it has been so unreliable. This salesman overhead me and had the nerve to say to me ""Most people who buy these cars can afford to take care of them."" in that usual, condescending MB way. I was livid. I had complained to the Sales Manager when I purchased the car because of the obnoxious attitude I had to deal with from the salesman. This guy knows me well. I told him that this was EXACTLY why I would never buy another MB again and I told the salesman that he was an ""ignorant <bleep>"" because I paid cash for the car to begin with. The Sales Manager said nothing but did give him a cross look. Who knows what happened later.

In any case, my 4 year warranty is up in May and I've only put 13k miles on it so it should be easy to sell. I'm not sure what (if anything) I'll get. I would like the SC430, my aunt in California has one and loves it! But I'm just not sure, it doesn't do anything special for me. I'll have to just wait and see."

I did see the LS430 in Cypress Pearl and I liked it a lot but my partner didn't. That was my first preference. We tried to see the Briarwood because it looks kind of nice in the media but there were none available and, in the end, I wasn't so sure I wanted to have to sell a ""brown"" car when I'm finished with it.

I really like the silver but that is what my STS is and we sort of have a mental block against it now. They Moonlight Pearl just seemed to look the nicest and will be easiest to resell. It's not ""White"" but it's closer to White than anything."

Of course, the MB is not a ""bucket of bolts"" but it's not the ""vault-like"" vehicle it once was.

BTW: I'm going to be driving my friends 1988 MB 420SEL for a couple of weeks after I turn in my STS and until the Lexus comes in. Now THAT is one of the best cars they have ever built. He drives a '98 S420 now but drives the '88 a lot because it's a much better car.

3806,"February 12, 2004 12:28PM",lenscap,"With most of the conversations here focusing on the Japanese and European cars, I thought I would add a few comments about Cadillac. I don't know anybody that owns one, so I checked out an SRX at the Chicago Auto Show the other day. The vehicle may drive very well (I have not driven one), but what a huge disappointment!

Here are parts of the car I find shocking, especially since the SRX I sat in was $58,000:

1. A 15-year-old design for what I'm guessing is the On-star antenna. I see these on all Cadillacs and it looks horrible. These huge antennas went out of style at least 10 years ago. Either design a small, modern antenna or do like many other brands with On-star and don't have any antenna.

2. Washer fluid squirters on the hood that are black. Would it have cost that much to have these painted body color so they actually match the color of the car?

3. The trim on the rear door, below the window where the chrome strip meets the black rubber surround, is not flush. It looks like Cadillac didn't make the chrome strip long enough and added a black rubber ""patch."" It was like this on all the SRXs and is totally inexcusable in a car costing this much.

4. Inside, the door material is hard and cheap. Again, what was Cadillac thinking when they chose this material?

5. There is a sliding cover on top of the center console. This cover is as flimsy and cheap as they come. It seems like it would be broken in no time. There is simply no ""substance"" to it.

6. The sides of the center console between the seats are also a very hard plastic. I expect this in a $20,000 car, but not one costing almost $60,000.

I could go on, but in short Cadilllac really needs to pay far better attention to the details on their cars if they want to command these premium prices."

The reason I asked him about such a thing is because it's funny to me that one would be able to gauge how well a car is built bodywise but can't tell the difference in the drive....thats very interesting to say the least. When I think about ""body build"" I'm talking about the solidity of the body, how the doors close etc, and yes paint and body panel fits, not lots of wood and leather than anyone can have in a car.

No Mercedes doesn't build them as tank-like anymore, the last such Benz was the 1992-1999 W140 S-Class and ironically your (R129) SL. Any of these cars, LS, S, 7, XJ, A8 or Pheaton would be hard pressed to be as rigid as the W126 (1981-1991) S-Class. If you built a car with steel and sheet metal that thick and pack on the features today's car require you'd wind up with a car of Maybach heft. That particular S-Class was engineered to take a direct hit front or rear at 65 mph and still allow the doors to open and close freely.

Another reason I asked because on this board especially you'd read these post and think a Mercedes doesn't even compare, and at times it's a little ridiculous.

I think the S-Class is a about the best balance product out there considering all the optional features coupled with arguably the best safety engineering around. They had to come down from the previous car, add way more features and lower the price at the same time, so yes a few trim pieces might not on the same level as before, but again on this board the Benz (according to some, not all) is so terrible and that is what I find to be downright ridiculous. Lexus on the other hand starts with one car and then covers two segments, smart yes...but I find the LS430 to be the most boring car in the segment, quality or not. It's a yawn box.

About your car, I agree your dealer is awful and such behavior is equally ridiculous. So they've never been able to fix your car?

I mentioned this quite a while ago on the LS board that a friend of mine, a die-hard MB fan for over 20 years, is finally making the move from his S500 to the 2004 LS. He waited out the 2003 model bcos he found out about the changes to the 2004, especially the 18"" wheels and the much improved sport-tuned (Euro) model. Well, he is now waiting for his to arrive at the dealership. He got exactly what he wanted, and for a whole lot less than the MB sales guy quoted him for a comparable S500. Along with the S500 he currently owned, he also had a 760iL which he literary gave away to charity a couple years back. One more LS owner, and one LESS MB owner. Personally, I cannot wait to take it for a spin. Would be fun comparing the 2004 LS430 Euro to my *decrepit* 1999 LS400 with the oh so soft suspension....

Me, I wait for the 2007 re-do. Will do whatever it takes to buy one in 3 years from now, trading in my current 1999 model. Which, btw, continues its spotless work with narry a problem to report."

The time it was inoperable when it got there (I had to have it brought in on a truck, after backing it onto the truck and covering it with a heavy painters tarp (that I had to buy) because it was stuck in about the 1/3 way up position.) it ""miraculously"" began working after the first day it was there. They even told me they didn't even have a chance to look at it, except for when it was first brought in and I made them try to operate it. Of course, when they went to work on it it was working so they just called me and said it was ""fixed"".

They were so unethical that when I asked them what the problem was the Service guy told me that the mechanic must have found something because it's now working but when I got the paperwork they had written it up as ""Convertible top operating to manufacturer specifications. Called customer and advised that technician could not duplicate problem."" Of course I was livid and made them change it.

Regarding your statement about the ""balance"" of the S class with it's options I'd have to differ. How can these ""options"" make the car ""balanced""? Many of these are standard on the LS430 and, even with the Ultra Pkg on the LS, the price is still $7k more than the base S430."

Then there are the numerous posts I have read about rattles and things that drove some people crazy on the S-class board. I read these things and hear about people's problems first hand, see things for myself, read the Wall Street Journal story of MB's quality decline and come to a subjective conclussion. I do it in business everyday as well. Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think so.

I don't doubt you that MB built a car as well as you stated in that time frame. I've heard those legendary stories as well. Do you not think that I also said to myself that in time I'll buy an MB because it's the best? But why did they stop building them that way? Obviously it was due to gas mileage issues or the market got far too competitive or it moved from those types of safety concerns or they misjudged how long they could build a car of that quality at a price people would pay. Maybe people just aren't willing to pay that kind of money for a car that can take a 65mph hit in the rear the way you describe. I wouldn't."

I would agree with those who say that the best Lexus models (LS and the big LX) have a better interior built than the Mercedes models they stack up against. Not that I've ever felt the comments about ""cheap"" Mercedes interiors are accurate - Mercs tend to stick to the clinical, highly functional German philosophy that sometimes comes across as borderline austerity. But indeed the Lexus build for the LS430 and LX470 sets standards, and I am someone who appreciates excellence in crafting mechanicals. It's simply superb. There are very few cars out there to rival it: the new Range Rover (but it's a $#@! to keep clean, a friend complains), and then you have to basically look for a Bentley's incredible oppulence. Jags I find somewhat overrated - my XJS was leather and wood almost everywhere (but endearingly creaky), the XJR had seen some Ford cost cutting and had some cheap material exposed to the touch (door armrests and wells, middle armrest the most blatant ones)."

Of course mileage and some other details would need to be worked out so they don't just have a field day with your car.

What I meant by the S-Class being balanced is that you can get whatever you want on it, and whatever you don't want. That level of customization combined with a lighter car than the previous edition was quite a feat imo. Yes the old car had the build, but on features it wouldn't have survived once all these newer cars came along.

ljflx,

I don't think you're ""wrong"" overall, but its the panic like talk on this board that gets me. You and others (at times) act like a Lexus has never, ever had a single problem. Seeing a mirror fall out of a door is not a normal thing on any car, especially a Benz. Not by a long shot. Once you hear certain things over and over about quality declining you'll believe it and look for every little thing you can find to underline this point. Yes there has been a quality decline at Mercedes-Benz, no argument from me there, but this hysteria about Benzes constantly being on the side of the road has gotten ridiculous. If someone tells you a story about a house being haunted, you'll be convinced of that the minute something happens in that house. Things that could happen in any house, or car for that matter. This talk like no one with a Benz or any other ""European"" car as you put it, having a good ownership experience has just really gotten as tired as all the raving about leather/wood/sound systems to me.

Mercedes stop building cars that way because basically their traditional ""overbuilt"" or over engineered way of doing things weren't appreciated by enough people to make the business plan viable anymore. Mercedes made all types of advances in their cars, things that other makers, save except Volvo, were still ""researching"". To really appreciate a Mercedes you have to see the guts or ""saw it in half"" as they say. The company has had to go through a many changes and change priorities due to the Japanese entering the market and secondly the need to sell more cars. When cars like Lexus come along with a fancy wooded interior and killer sound system people could care less about the engineering aspect of the car, as long as it works. This is what Mercedes must either make reliable or change. A very tough spot to be in.

I personally am not impressed with all the wood/leather/sound systems that Lexus partially makes their case with. I like the more technical aspects of a car. A car like a ES330 or LS430 are no different in theme (not execution) from a Avalon or Camry.

3817,"February 14, 2004 8:54AM",jamesfletcher2,"merc1,

I respect your dialog and insight but your statement ""car like a ES330 and LS430 are no different in theme (not execution) from a Avalon or Camry"" is a bit much. The Camry, Avalon and ES330 are all engineered off of the same Toyota front-wheel drive platform. The only Lexus vehicle that is possibly comparable to the rear-wheel drive LS430 is the Lexus GS - at least from a basic platform.

Like you, I still love MB cars (and German car driving dynamics in general). I own a MB SL (R129), in addition to a Lexus LS, 4x4 Suburban and some other vehicles. I own different vehicles because of different needs and desires plus for multiple home locations that dictate unique recreational or diving situations. I plan on keeping our SL for ages but am somewhat waiting for the new S-Class (2005) and new LS (2006) and will then most likely make a purchase decision between the two.

I have by far owned more German cars then any others and still keep looking at the current MB S600. I just love the torque and power of the supercharged V12 and the amazing handling of a car of its size. Unlike others, if I was to purchase another S-Class it would almost certainly be the S600 not a S-Class V8 offering. Unfortunately, I have just hear and known of too many electronic and other issues with the current S-class but keep trying to convince myself that maybe they have finally fixed them. I still long for the days when MB engineering was more mechanical instead of electronic. Also, I am somewhat put off by the spy photos of the new S-Class since I just love the looks of the current generation.

Anyway, keep up the MB information coming - I really appreciate your posts. Like you I love their driving dynamics and beautiful designs. And if you know any current generation S600 owners I would love to talk to them. Quite a while back I posted a query on the S-Class board for S600 owners and got zero replies.

I think you and ljflx misunderstood what I meant by that statement about the Camry/LS/ES. What I meant is that they are similar in theme, not actual execution. Meaning that from the top of the Toyota line to the bottom they make great appliances, reliable etc, but they're designs (exterior, interior) control layout, etc are the same. A LS430 really doesn't say anymore outwardly than an Avalon does, though it might ride 10 times better and is much quieter. This doesn't detract away from what the LS430 can do and how it does it for most, but for me it does to a degree. What I'm saying there is nothing aesthetically to get excited about. There's no true ""design"" or appeal to a Lexus for me. The only ones I even remotely like are the SC430 and surprise, surprise the GX470. I know how ""great"" the car is, based on yours or ljflx's criteria.

She had some trouble getting the ES330 up her driveway a couple of times. Whoever removed her snow did a half-__ job of it and the remaining layer turned to glare ice, not the car's fault. On my parents block they have those steep driveways with that large dip where the driveway meets the street. Anyway she liked everything about it except for the size. I have to admit I did like it as much as I could like an SUV I guess. I still like the Touareg better, mainly due to its more manageable size and Euro interior.

3829,"February 16, 2004 8:16AM",92735i,"I have been in the market for a new car and have driven many fine automobiles.

Audi A6 V8
Audi A8L
MB S500
MB S55
BMW 740i Sport Package 2001
BMW 745i
LS 430
Q45

I was completely disappointed with the ride quality of the Q45, and yes, MB S500.

The Audi A6 with V8 engine handled like a porsche, too rough for Chicago roads.

A8L nice cabin, yawn.
Lexus, yawn.
S55, same as S500 but with more power. Road noise in a $100k car? fugedaboudit.

The 2001 740i with Sport Package handled very close to the Audi A6, I drove it right after. I was amazed at the performance and handling of such a large car.

As a result, my anticipation for the 745i test drive was peaked. There is no question the 745i is superior. Smooth while in city traffic, great acceleration, unbelievable handling, not bad on gas either.

Mine has arrived in S. Carolina, waiting to arrive at dealer.

I notice all the posts on the Lexus, it seems to me that there is a good amount of rationalization for buying down to the LS.

People buy cars for different reasons, no one reason or rationale is superior to the other. To compare cars that are designed for completely different markets, ie LS430 and BMW 7, accomplishes little.

I went out searching for the best driving experience, period. Value was a second consideration. I drove cars $30k-$40k more, and less than the BMW 7. The 7 was the last car I drove.

For the total driving experience, as I like to experience it, it is far superior than any Japanese or comparable German car."
3830,"February 16, 2004 9:21AM",mfullmer,"First, people who buy and love the LS430 need not ""rationalize"" anything. They are going with what they, the Auto Media, the Consumer Media, and the main stream Media consider to be the ""Best Luxury Vehicle made"".

Second, why is choosing a vehicle that happens to be the least expensive ""Buying Down""???

Using that sort of thinking (which I am loathe to do), a BMW 745i buyer would be ""Buying Down"" also as it's price is $700 under the MSRP of $70,079 for my LS430.

And someone who goes in to Starbucks to get their favorite coffee are ""Buying Down"" by getting their choice of brewed coffee instead of the espresso based coffees? After all, he's getting something that costs three times less than the ""Latte"".

It's snobbish and condescending remarks like that, 92735i, that further prove the mind-set of ""European Mark Only"" folks, and in particular, ""BMW Only"" folks.

It also proves my ongoing point that ""European Mark Only"" folks are FOR THE MOST PART interested mainly in having a vehicle for show factor.

There is no defense for that remark - Snobbery and condescention about vehicles is totally wrong, especially when you say later that ""no one reason or rationale is superior..."".

3842,"February 16, 2004 4:44PM",sv7887,"Hello All,
  My my...How things change in this forum..I must admit I can see Mfuller's point. I don't see how choosing a 745i over a LS430 is ""Buying down"" As far as I'm concerned, when someone makes comments about my Lexus cars I challenge them to find a better experience. I proudly point to my 1992 LS400 which had $3 (That's right THREE dollars) in non scheduled maintenance issues over 11 yrs. Still can hear a pindrop with the engine running.

I've complained before that these cars are overdoing it on the horsepower. The 250 HP on my 92 LS is more than enough. The 290 HP on my LS430 is tempting me to engage in some foolishness. Where exactly are we going to use it? I don't think it's worth the ticket from the good old State Police. What is it with the questions about Lexus buyers? I'll state the reasons why I've bought 3 and will continue to do so:

1) Quality, Quality, Quality. Nice to have a pretty car, but what's the point if it spends time in the shop. Time is money. Never been stranded my any of the LS cars, Ever.

2) Service: You sneeze in a Lexus dealer and they'll wipe your nose for you. Okay a little exaggerated...But they've handled the insurance company wonderfully on my 1992 LS. All OEM parts, and brought the loaner car to my house and let me have it for 11 days, and for the repeated visits afterward.

3) Price. After paying $67K in 9/02 I was starting to wonder whether this car was the value it once was. I paid $43K in 9/92 for my LS. But if you look at the competition, I can see why they're a winner. I drove the S-Class, BMW, and Jaguar. They're all nice cars, but I couldn't justify the price premium in my mind. We're all reasonably well off here, but I'm sure we know the value of a dollar.

4)Resale:
  Never had an issue trying to sell one. In a fit of rage, I put my 92 for sale a few weeks ago. I had 4 calls immediately. They were even willing to pay full purchase price. The Lexus mechanic told me I was crazy to sell such a nice car, and I recovered my senses and held on to it.

I realize paying more money is supposed to imply prestige or god knows what. Keep in mind paying a premium doesn't always imply better quality or what not. A $10 Casio Quartz watch will likely be more reliable than a traditional geared Rolex. (No joke, I assure you. Rolex even charges you an extra $1,000 for ""Advanced Quartz technology"") Why the price disparity? Simple, we all put a premium on fashion, uniqueness, prestige..You are all entitled to do what you want with your money, but don't criticize the informed Lexus buyer who puts a premium on piece of mind rather than Autobahn rated performance.

BTW, Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer are proud owners of LS430's. I don't think they're ""Buying down""

SV"
3843,"February 16, 2004 6:19PM",ljflx,per your link - If I only had one Lexus vehicle I'd only be in the shop 2 times a year (maybe 3 times in year one because they do a quick 1k mile check). I go 8-10k miles between visits. But Lexus is very much like MB in that you will tend to buy your second car as a Lexus as well. Thus your service visits double. The service they give you is phenomenal (at least in all my experience) so you remember it very well. One time when they screwed up on a loaner car for my wife they actually drove her home in a stretch limo and then picked her up. They also told to have the driver take her wherever she wanted to go. That is not service you forget. I've never had a car in for anything but maintenance in 9 years. But with 3 vehicles I am in there about 5x a year.

3845,"February 16, 2004 7:19PM",shipo,"...but, by what measure is the 745i an inferior car?

If you mean which one will most likely cost the least in money and aggrivation, you're right, it's probably the Lexus. However, if you're standard unit of measure is which one is more capable at speed, or which one can get around a closed circut the fastest, then the Lexus ain't got nuthin' on the 745i.

On the LS board there are posts about problems, just like any other cars. YES, they are less frequent than other brands, but they are there.

Now tell me on an 11 year old car, are you counting all the things that any car will need to have done in that time frame, as ""maintenance"" instead of repairs. Your post reads like a Lexus will never, ever have anything to wear out and eventually need ""attention"".

Some would claim that the definition of true luxury is utter scarcity: a Rolex is a mass watch -though perceived as a precious luxury good by a wide section of the population-, a Parmigiani or Vacheron Constantine or Audemars Piguet a different matter.

To a certain degree, it entertains me to see how much passion some have riding on what at the end of the day are all quite utilitarian sedan drives. I thought only sportscar fans felt that pasisonate about their cars. Then again, I notice a lot of passion in here is about brands rather than cars, which seems somewhat odd, but at the end of the day just a manifestation of the the-brands-I-advertise-are-part-of-my-individual-identity-and-exp- ression mentality in modern life which some Calvin&Hobbes cartoon so brilliantly mocks.

I like the Maserati a lot it has some of the less utilitarian appeal the old Jag XJ model used to have, sacrificing some function for emotion. Perhaps it's just the fact it's the utter oddball brand in the US these days. With the Bentley, actually much prefer the old Continental to the new one.

I understand your view and, to be perfectly honest with myself, I see the overbulking too. It's just that I have waited so long to see if Lexus would ever re-establish its own look with the LS, and continue to be disappointed. I have a '92 LS400 and was heart-broken when they began the march toward styling the rear toward MB. Every year I hoped against hope for a return to the low, sleek, feline curves of the original, and every year I was pained anew.

The GT reminds me of the smooth curves of the early LS, albeit way too muscular.

Truth be told, I forced myself back to a Lexus dealer last week and tried, really tried, to connect with the 430 -- I just couldn't do it. If I wanted a MB, I would simply buy one (having already done so for my wife). I know the ride would be great in the LS430 -- no question there. The dealer was a bit puzzled as to why I didn't want to drive it. I told him that my block was the boxed S design presentation and color choices. Not very logical stuff, I realize, but very significant aesthetically to me.

So, I guess I've decided to live in a shoe for a little while rather than a box -- at least until we see what the 2007 LS looks like!"
3854,"February 17, 2004 4:31PM",sv7887,"Merc,
  I can understand your pain as you've not had a taste of the Lexus experience. (Come to the dark side! LOL!) I've owned practically everything in the Luxury car segment with the exception of a BMW. Yes, these cars are REALLY that good. If you've owned three LS cars like I have, you'd probably say the same thing.

The 1992 LS in question was bought new. I've spent maybe $3,000 in all those scheduled maintenance issues (5K to 91K) services. The car has always started on the first turn of the key, and never has had any mechanical issues. I've been limited to replacement of a couple of light bulbs totaling $3. Ah, yes, I had the rear shocks replaced b/c the floaty Lexus ride was too much for me. Total cost $325 at a Lexus dealer. (That was an elective procedure).

The car was recently hit (Left Front Side) at 35 MPH by an idiot driver running a red light. Repairs totaled $7,500. So I can only attest to the first 11 years, as any data now will be skewed.

Keep in mind I am the original owner of my 1992. Most of those cars you read about are on their third or fourth owner. Relevance? They probably are cutting corners on maintenance. (as is the case with most lux cars that age) I find it irritating people seem to think they can service these cars at Jiffy Lube or the local gas station..They then complain when something breaks due to lack of scheduled maintenance.

Lexus focuses on Preventative maintenance, so I can see why I've had such little issues with the car. Of course I've had brake pads replaced, but again nothing than the normal deal. I'm sure someone can provide the numbers and confirm my suspicion that a LS car will have lower down time and cheaper repair costs Long term.

I can understand your feelings. I've owned MB cars (1988 300 SE), a Jag XJ6, and a Lincoln in the past. I buy cars in cash and for the long term. Like most educated consumers out there I want the best experience for the money. It's what made me switch from MB. I didn't feel the product justified the price premium. It's a matter of opinion.

Then I realized that I would never truly enjoy the car if ""protecting it"" was a lingering concern.

3861,"February 17, 2004 11:02PM",ksurg,"I've been waffling a long time now on leasing or purchasing a new vehicle. Recently I decided on leasing a luxury vehicle, which ironically is where I started.
In re entering the leasing market it is clear that some of the standard price considerations don't apply especially if you plan on turning over the vehicle at lease end. For instance, a 745i can be leased cheaper than an A8L given the lower residual on the Audi despite the higher MSRP on the BMW. The same is true in comparing a XJ-8 vs. LS430.
Next is research will only get you so far. I'm not debating JD powers, intellichoice or our host Edmunds...but does everyone always agree on appearance or ease of operation? Several days ago I drove a 745i that was unprepped and not programmed. My impression was that it was indeed deep in complicated technology but for me the layout was intuitive and reasonably laid out. Maybe for those of us who own planes or boats certain types of technology are less daunting. Interestingly anyone who thinks auto technology and the landscape of the cockpit won't change will probably be disappointed. Someone recently commented that ""rich businessmen won't buy a car that requires a teenager to drive."" I don't know about anyone else but my teenagers are growing up quick. I recently saw a auto mag with ""auto's of the future."" The layout doesn't even resemble a present day car, in fact there was no obvious gearshift and no foot pedals! So much for easily accessible audio controls.
The point I'm getting to is that major changes in technology seem to meet a lot of resistance. BMW took a lot of heat for a vehicle that may turn out to be the link between the auto of today and tomorrow. If guilty, their mistake was releasing the technology before perfected and maybe before we were ready for it. The whole situation reminds me of other areas of technology where people focused on the downsides and resisted change. What office still functions efficiently without faxes, computers, DSL...
With the above said I am leaning towards the 745i but felt compelled to write this given the expectation the 7 series was poorly conceived and designed. For the record other vehicles driven included the S500, A8L, XJ-8 and the venerable LS430(seemingly this boards favorate...please let's not review the reliability issue again)."

sv7887,

Point taken. Older luxury cars that haven't been maintained like yours are the ones that most people get I guess, because I see a lot more being done on early 90's LS' (second hand) than that. The Lexus ""experience"" just isn't for me...

jstyle,

That is the exact same thing I said on the A6 board in the future auto section. They're doing what BMW used to, cockpit wise.

Pablo......your comments on the interior are correct also. I expected something along the lines of the A8, but they've done a rather generic layout imo. The whole car has moved towards being generic, nothing like the A8 or A4.

This argument always surfaces and this is my answer.

Around 1984, it was clear to me that the world was going to be turned upside down by computers and those who didn&#146;t accept it were going to be in for a rough ride. However this whole digital story is about PRODUCTIVITY... more for less. In 1984 It would take at least 12 people to do my work today. This we can&#146;t stop. It&#146;s manifest destiny.

The problem with bringing computers into cars is that it is counterproductive, unlike office computers. It takes more effort now to adjust what should be simple climate control and radio functions. What used to take one move now takes several. At least if it cut production costs for the auto makers you could make an argument but I doubt this is the case. It&#146;s glitz and change for the sake of change, not progress.

I never cease to be amazed at how the ergonomics in my $24K Subaru are superior to that of my $48K BMW. In the Subaru it takes one move to change the heating direction while in the BMW it sometimes takes several. The BMW cockpit does look more impressive though and I suspect having an LCD screen light up the new cockpits will have the same effect. Technology and the APPEARANCE of technology has always been part of the BMW countenance even though owning a BMW has always been somewhat of a pain in the butt because of it.

Then there&#146;s the BMW ride, so good that we just accept the shorcomings. BMW had better watch its step though. This current schism is like nothing we&#146;ve ever seen before. What with the controversial styling there appears to be a limit to what the BMW &#147;technophile&#148; will put up with."
3864,"February 18, 2004 7:17AM",mfullmer,"For those that use the technology how it intended to be used, it IS a timesaver.

Take electronic climate control - I use it the way it is intended. It is set at the temperature that I like and on ""Auto"". The only manual adjustment I make is when I turn the A/C button on or off in response to outside humidity.

And electronic radios - give me a break! Do you not remember having to manually tune radios and get it just right so that it wasn't 1/2 on and 1/2 off the station? No need to do that with the electronic radio of today.

What about memory seats? Talk about a time-saver. When you have two cars that two people drive 1/2 and 1/2 it saves a lot of time."

ksurg - good luck on whatever car you choose. The lease prices you talk about are indeed changing the landscape. As I posted a few times - I can get a $77k 745 at the same lease ptrice as a $70k LS430. That is with having negotiated the LS430 and not even having begun negotiating the 745. I'm not interested in the 745 but my experience is MB and Lexus have lease pricing in the S-500 and LS430 that more truly reflect the MSRP's of both cars whereas BMW is heavily subsidizing the 745 lease deals. No one should buy the 745 outright. Much smarter move is to lease and buy at lease end. Even the LS430 leans that way though it is a real close call depending on what you think you could get with the upfront principal you'd NOT be laying out."
3868,"February 18, 2004 10:28AM",ksurg,"I don't necessarily believe that BMW executed all the technology well in the 745i. To some extent all manufacturers are guilty of sensationalizing their products or putting in useless features( I'm still trying to figure out why I want a rear video cam). As for BMW they are still improving idrive. Though not perfect the '04 version is better. I don't really agree with the technology not enhancing auto function no more than I agree with a manual shift being more efficient than F1 paddles or a SMG transmission. Is it more fun for me to drive a manual... sometimes!
Progress is going to continue and at times we need to stay flexible and willing to change our perspectives. As I said in my last post, BMW was guilty of releasing a vehicle that was a ways short of adequate testing to assure the first customers didn't become beta testers. That part is hard to forgive and I hope they learned their lesson. But I'm in the market now and find to my surprise the BMW is a pretty nice vehicle for the lease price."

I have not tried out idrive but from what I understand it takes something like five steps just to set a radio station into memory, compared to one step for pretty much any other car.

Is there really a need for all these complicated electronics? The more complex the design, the more issues you're going to face. We're buying cars, not F-22's!

After repeatedly telling BMW I was not interested in their 7-Series, I recently heard from them to inform me that the 2005 restyled 7-Series should hopefully be available in late spring. Although I still do not like the appearance of the 7-Series from what I was able to see from a couple of pictures the front-end all the way to the A-pillar and the lights were significantly improved. However, even though there appear to be slight changes to the rear-end and trunk lid if was not enough to solve the serious problem the have with the rear of the car (in my opinion). They also said that there would be some improvements to the iDrive but did not elaborate.

My point is that if you can wait a few months you can get into an improved 7-Series that should be more satisfying.

A multi-store BMW dealer I have purchased from before and know personally. The only thing he was not certain of at this point was the exact time frame it will hit the US shores after appearing in Europe very soon. He said that BMW is pulling out all of the stops to get the re-style out to try to overcome customer acceptance problems with the original ""Bangle'd"" 7-Series.

From what I could gather, BMW dealers are having one hell of a time trying to move the current 7-Series and monthly sales are dropping in spite of incentives that BMW is throwing at the 7-Series. My take was that he can not wait for the 2005 model and does not want to get stuck holding too many 2004s.

Simpler seat controls, and most importantly an updated (i.e. simplified) Idrive system.

  I favor the touchscreen design, you spend less time fiddling in order to get your job done.

Here's a thought: In the F-15, fighter pilots can access nearly all relevant functions on stick. They know the buttons by touch and can dial up the function on the Heads Up Display. I realize I'm talking about a $40 Million plus fighter jet, but this was developed in the mid 1970's. I know BMW has implemented a HUD display (Option on 5-Series?) so why not take it further one step? I think it would avoid distractions by having everything projected in front of the driver.

The BMW 7 just isn't my thing. I've looked at one but didn't feel inclined to drive it. I'm willing to bet it's far more exciting to drive than my LS cars. As for all these high end cars: AMG et all, how many of these do they sell? From a marketing perspective why do they offer them? Prestige?

They claim that they don't have any info about the '05 or when it will be released. They will only have info when it goes into production( normally this would be in Sept. but could be next month). They specifically refused to send me written confirmation of this. In other words they weren't willing to on record about not having any info at this time. Although I understand their position it makes me suspicious and angry. If I am buying a $78K auto months from a new release and am savvy enough to contact them I deserve a more honest and informative answer.
3888,"February 19, 2004 5:30PM",jamesfletcher2,"ksurg,

The front-end of the 7-Series pictures I was shown looked much like the one in the car connection link that maxhonda99 posted. I have to admit that since I was not overly interested I did not study them closely. I saw three pictures - one directly from the front, one looking at the side and front from an angle (passenger side) and one from the passenger side looking at the rear but only exposing the corner of the rear-end. My impression was very much like the text on the link - that the car was rounded-out on all quarters and some of the more pronounced BMW styling clues (e.g., kidney-type grill) from generations of BMWs were somewhat back (although only slightly).

I do not believe that he had more pictures and did not ask but they appeared to be official BMW photos. I personally know 3 - 4 owners of car dealerships and it is just like merc1 says. They get significant information about upcoming models months before official introduction.

My personal experiences agree with merc1 that they want to keep you in the dark so that you will buy what they currently have to sell and BMW North America does the same. Quite frankly, being a businessman I can not blame them.

However, he seemed very hopeful that they would have them by late summer instead of September/October. I did ask him if by late summer he meant June and he said ""yes"". As I mentioned yesterday, I distinctly got the idea that he (and other BMW dealers) want the restyled 7-Series as much as any BMW owner or prospective buyer.

I wish that I could provide you more but I am not really a prospective BMW buyer. I am trying to find out what the totally re-engineered 2006 MB S-Class is going to look like and what new technology it will have (e.g., brake-by-wire, etc). I am seriously considering leasing a current S-Class and then waiting for the 2006 S-Class and the 2007 Lexus LS. That way, if I do not like the new ones I can keep the current S-Class model which I believe is the best looking luxury car available in the US. I had two friends that did the same thing with the former BMW 7-Series and when they saw the new one they felt like geniuses.

What is your take on the prospective styling and technology of upcoming 2007 S-Class versus the current one? Some of the spy photos I saw on a German car site seemed to indicate its exterior will be a much larger version of the new E-Class with some continued styling evolution (which is typical of MB)? As I have mentioned, I really like the styling of the current S-Class which is only out done within MB by the big CL coupe (but I need four doors).

However, although I could go with the new styling even though I am not sure it is better, what really worries me is new technology introduction. You brought up a really good example recently based on spy photos that seem to indicate a MB version of BMW iDrive or Audi's similar system. I am really a big fan of NAV/etc setups with a touch screen coupled with conventional buttons like the current S-Class and Lexus LS.

Another technology that I hear is going to absolutely make it to the new S-Class is electronic brake-by-wire. Reviewers and owners of the new E-Class seem to universally hate the lack of proper feel and poor modulation of brake-by-wire. Sometimes it just seems like MB is obsessed with adding new technology for the sake of it and do not realize that most of their luxury car customers don't want these technology items or the quality glitches they seem to bring.

3897,"February 21, 2004 2:16PM",merc1,"We're definitely on the same page in reguards to styling of the current S and especially the CL.

I personally expect the next S to be what you said, an evolution of the new E-Class, but with a slightly different rear end. I'n not sure if the next car (just going by the spy photos and various drawings) will look as good as the current car, especially the Sport version of the current S. IMO only the A8 even compares looks wise. The 7-Series continues to be hideous to me.

It might be a little too early to speculate about its styling without a definite drawing or an uncamoflouged prototype being caught during testing.

I've read where the brake by wire of the E and SL won't make it into the next S due to cost reasons. This sounds bass-ackwards to me, simply because the S is much more expensive than the E-Class anyway. So who knows what they'll do there. Incredibly ""electromechanical"" brakes are being developed for the S, but not at the initial launch. Automatic lane correction has (thankfully) been pushed back, due to concerns about all this tech debuting in a totally new car, which will also include (rarely for MB) an all need engine range also.

So far everything says that Mercedes will adopt some type of idrive controller combined with the next generation of Comand. The controller will reportedly give the driver a choice between using the conventional buttons or not. From what the British press says, the controller won't take the place of basic controls like in the BMW. I must say that the spy photograph presented by autospies looks just like the 7-Series BMW, right down to the air vents and gearshift, scary. I for one can't believe Mercedes would copy the styling of the 7-Series interior, that would be an unprecedented move (read: mistake) on Mercedes' part.

The digital vs mechanical confrontation presents very interesting design challenges and I don't think BMW has thought this out rationally. Personally, I believe they can't successfully eliminate conventional controls and in the not -too-distant future today's iDrive will be deemed grossly insufficient and deficient.

In cars, digital technology must work seemlessly in the background. We need less interaction from the driver, not more. The wheel itself is mechanical and low-tech, but we are stuck with it. Even in the most sophisticated military and space craft mechanical controls are still in abundance. Short of sophisticated voice rec, nothing can replace the convenience of a one-touch mechanical button or dial. Will be interesting to see where this goes."

I guess we'll see if an LS can make a low 4s 0-60mph. The 2004 already is under 6s, with no engine change just going from a 5-speed to a 6-speed tranny. So with a 38% hp increase from 290hp to 400hp, and no significant increase in weight, a low 5s, and even sub-5s is a real possibility for such an engine.

Yes, in general Lexus is a very conservative company, but if you listen to Clements last press release, they are looking to change that. They are clearly intending to target BMW in their new releases starting MY2006, and will include a performance tuning unit. That alone spells a huge change, that Lexus will produce factory-tuned performance-luxury cars, along the same lines as the M and AMG. I guess they are now shedding their conservative approach to a fairly more aggressive stance. And about time too.

Styling changes. Witness the 2006 GS. Regardless of what many think, vanilla styling it is NOT. RX400H engine is a certainty as the future move is into hybrid technology, and Toyota/Lexus is in the lead here. A 400+bhp engine can be done, and *probably* will be done. Who knows what the specs will be on that engine ? Maybe low 5s (0-60), or even low 11s in the 1/4-mile ! Lexus knows it must shed its current luxo-cruiser image to grow, and they have the will, the money and the determination to do what it takes. And if history is any judge, they will meet and beat expectations."

Really, what percentage of Mercedes sold in the world market has V12 engine anyway? Same goes for BMW and Audi. This is just a gimmick car companies employ to enhance their hollow status symbol. Daimler Benz, BMW, Jaguar, Audi, etc are not the same company they were 25 years ago when they had the entire luxury car market to themselves. Toyota has taken a considerable portion of that market with the introduction of the Lexus lineup. In fact, the lower end cars from BMW and Mercedes actually competes with Toyota and Honda rather than Lexus or Acura. In Europe the most popular Mercedes is the C class which is almost as common as Camrys are in North America.

I think it meant they were'nt going to play the game of 450-500+HP engines particularly when they guzzle gas like crazy. Jumping the HP to 340-360 is a must to stay competitive mainly for marketing purposes. But they will do it with hybrids hence the earlier comment by the CEO of not playing the game. When these hybrid engines hit the scene getting 20-30+mpg and giving you 350-400HP (which is badly needed for the big suv's and not the cars) everyone will be chasing Toyota's lead. I'm not really looking for a quicker 0-60 but I'll never turn down more torque.

Brake by wire has proven in certain applications to dramatically shorten stopping distances.

We'll see about all that. I seriously doubt Lexus will do the type of car needed to outdo an E55 or M5; it would need 500hp to do this. To get a Hybrid to do this would be an expensive and arduous task indeed. A mere 400hp won't get it anymore if you're trying to out-do these cars.

I have never been a fan of the exterior (I must say all new BMWs have been extremely clumsily executed design wise, and don't do the cars' dynamic excellence justice), but I was surprised that the interior didn't do much for me, either. I thought I'd like the avant-garde clean interior, but the lack of a shifter and such renders the interior somewhat... soccer mom van like, really. Materials excellent, but something's missing. The 5 series is also very underwhelming when seen live. Looks Acura-like. Not that Acuras aren't extremely competent cars, this is just to point out the proportiones simply aren't as *right* as BMWs of the past always had. The look is gettig more bloated, as if all their products were becoming middle-aged.

Then I saw a Maybach driving back home for work, and again I think the car terribly designed. It looks like an Oldsmobile supercar or something, those back lights are inexcusable.

mariner7,

The CLS (CLE was just the concept name, though I like ""CLE"" better) is supposed to be a 4-door Coupe, and yes it is based on the E-Class platform. Mercedes seems to deem whatever bodystyle they want to be a ""Coupe"". First the hatchback C230 is a Coupe, now the 4-door CLS is a ""Coupe"" also. Only at Mercedes-Benz.

The CLS350 (all new 3.5L V6 268hp) and CLS500 (5.0L V8 302hp) will be priced between the E and S-Class sedans. Both will have the new 7-speed tranny also. Expect some type of AMG version in a year or so.

Britain's CAR magazine (you guys have got to pick up a copy this magazine, it puts the US mags to shame) said that BMW and Audi wishes they could position a car in their ranges like MB has done with the CLS, we'll see if that pans out. Again, I personally wanted a true 2-door coupe based on the E-Class, but there hasn't been one since 1995, and what a car that was, btw.

I had several issues with CLS. I say had because one of them was not and issue as it turns out. I'm pretty much cool with the CLS as long as IT IS NOT the styling direction of other future Mercedes-Benzes. That fear *seems* to be unfounded. The next S won't look like the CLS. My other issue is that while they did make the interior a little different, they didn't go far enough. I'm not sure what all colors and woods will be offered on the CLS, but they should be from the Designo group and they should be standard order items on this car (none of that extra charge stuff), you know make is different and special. Secondly I would have liked to have seen a different interior design, not just and updated E-Class interior.

I have to agree with john. Counting the CLS, how many trims/models does MB now have ?

C/CL/CLK/CLS
E
S/SL/SLK

All for what ? MB remained mired in 3rd place in lux car sales in the US, down from numero uno just a few years ago. Would the CLS push MB car sales higher ? GM's Cadillac is breathing down MB's neck for 3rd place, and may do it this year. I just don't get it with MB and umpteenth new models.

See Lexus don't need no stinking gazillion trims to be #1 in less than 15 yrs. Lexus business model seems to be much better than MBs. Lexus will come up with a very refreshing redesign, add hybrid technology, improve safety features, and make electronics much better integrated.

However you should quit trying to mislead everyone into thinking that Lexus' sales might is based on an all-star lineup of high sellers because it isn't.

The fact remains that Mercedes' sales are more spread out and they aren't as dependent on just few models for their sales numbers. The C, E, S, SL, and CLK all pull their weight. Lexus depends on the ES, RX and to a lesser extant the GX for all their sales glory. The IS, GS, LX don't do squat for the sales press releases.

Are you ever going to understand the Mercedes' pricing may have just the slightest effect on them selling more cars than Lexus? Where is it written that sales = best cars? All this talk about sales sounds like GM type rhetoric to me. This isn't beneath the great Lexus?

On these points all I can say is apply the correct quote.....from your post #4209.

""Yada yada yada.... Really very boring stuff this.......Very boring indeed. Give it a rest will ya ?""

About the CLS, whether or not you see the point or not is irrelevant, it will most likely be in hot demand as any newly introduced Benz has been in the last few years. The MB ""business model"" isn't as good a Lexus', but yet Lexus has expressed interest in offering more models to broaden their appeal. Hmmmmmm. Example: Lexus tries to cover the CLK and SL segment with one car, yet doesn't come close to comparing to the SL and is only competitive with the CLK. Wise marketing if you want to limit the appeal of the brand. Meanwhile Mercedes gets double the market presence (and sales since they're so important to you) in the convertible/GT segment. If Mercedes can't do anything else they know how to market their cars. They are a master of this.

As far as seeing the point, I see no point for the IS300, as hardly anyone looking for performance is shopping Lexus, ditto the GS430. Witness their lack of sales. Yet a LS430 with a 4 second 0-60 time has a ""point"". Right. To you a Benz is a waste of money, period. Why would the CLS be any different?

You feel better when the company you buy from makes $8B in *profits*? I actually prefer to see more money going into R&D, and it could be argued the Merc model is more customer-oriented, doing everything possible to give people *exactly* the car they want.

Absolutely, but so is MB. All I am saying is that the $8B in profits could also be construed by someone as an argument to show they overcharge their customers and don't pass on the efficiency and productivity gain they achieve with their customers' money back.

Ljflx's point on MB spreading itself too thin is quite important here. Let us assume that you are correct that MB is *investing* their R&D money in a slew of new products, how come they cannot invest more into quality and more reliable vehicle ? Do you see that they are doing this *investing* to improve their image or to improve their bottom line ? Methinks their image is suffering big time right now, with all those black circles from CR, and ditto their bottomline. Now contrast that with Lexus, they spend money on R&D (how else would they put together such world-class cars like the LS, GX, LX, etc ?) It takes spending money to make money, but gotta be spent in the right place ! So Lexus spends its money *wisely*, improving and refining quality output, new technologies, new designs, and setting standards in customer service, while MB spends its money (some would say, unwisely) churning out kadzillion models, with poor customer service. Maybe MB thinks that they can blindfold the buying public's eye against their lack-luster reliability records. The more MB cars become less reliable, the more new models they churn out. That, IMO, is their business model. Only time will tell if this approach will work in the long run. Guess we'll see, won't we ?"
3947,"February 27, 2004 5:08PM",sv7887,"Hi All,
  Ah yes, the typical MB argument. Any Industrial Organization class will tell you that the consumer prefers variety. MB offers a car for practically anyone. It's good marketing on their part. If they can attract an owner at the C class Entry point and give them a good experience, the owner will likely move up the MB chain as income increases. All these predictions of doom for MB are grossly overstated. Every car company has it's bad times.

I have to agree with Merc on his comments about the Blandness of the Lexus line. They came out in 1990 with excellent and cutting edge cars. (LS, ES, SC) Today, they don't offer anything especially appealing. The IS has little or no fit, the GS is lackluster, and the LS430 has become the More reliable knockoff of the S Class. Don't even get me started on the ES or SC.

People will pay a premium for exclusiveness and ""perceived prestige."" The Lexus maybe better in areas of reliablity, service, etc, but MB still has originality and prestige on their side.

Until Lexus gets a grip on producing original designs, they're always going to be knocked in this department.

I've seen the pictures of the CLS, interesting concept, but I didn't think it was anything special in looks. Just pure subjective opinion here. To be honest, the only car I liked was the old XJ8. Say what you want about Jaguar, but their designs provoked a real response from people. (except for the X-Type..Yeck!)

So the new model variations and poweful engines are really a way of supporting a weakening brand name. Remember you still hear MB execs who are in denial about the quality decline. I read one comment last week from one of their top guys who said their cars are as good as ever. Even MB's most loyal fans know better than that. I just watched the HBO show about the US upset of the Soviets in the 1980 Olympics. Comments like that remind me of the Soviet feeling that no one could stay close to them in a game let alone beat them in the 1980 Olympics.

As for all that variety - I honestly can't keep track of all their cars. It's a bit like having 300 satellite stations. I have Dish Network and they added some new stations a while back and I just realized it today."

Only in the E_vs_GS. And the long-tooth of the GS is not helping, not bcos the GS430 is not competitive. Au contraire ! The E320/500 are good-looking designs, I agree, hopefully the new 2006 GS will help, especially if it comes with the rumored hybrid engine and AWD.

3952,"February 27, 2004 8:33PM",pablo_l,"I'd just like to point out that it's not like I am a fan of MB's strategy. While it's true that offering lots of variations for everyone is a marketing strategy 101, it is a strategy that typically doesn't work well with luxury goods. Luxury goods suffer from overexposure. Luxury buyers don't like to see their brand name of choice pitched as aggressively as 7up. I do think MB has been diluting their brand name for a while, and that it is a miracle the image of exclusivity still sticks - perhaps they are doing something extremely smart in managing it, but most likely they got lucky because public perception in matters of cars seems to have a lot of inertia. Don't get me wrong, I think the aggressive claims about lack of quality are somewhat over-stated, and in part stem from comparison with the old expectation that a Merc is built like the proverbial vault, which clearly is no longer the case. MB started building cars to a cost point, and no longer to a standard - oddly enough, it seems Lexus has actually picked up the fastidious habit of overengineering for reliability and a somewhat stodgy an boring image. Which incidentally is the image that MB had in Germany in the late 70s to early 90s: it was the bourgeois choice, and hip young professionals did the Beemer and Audi thing, while their parents bought Mercedes. Truly, it is a fact that's the history in Germany. This is a very different Mercedes from the company that established the brand name. But it's also a different BMW, so we'll see how it pans out.

I just find it interesting that many of the arguments I hear used against Lexus in here are arguments that made the round in Germany by BMW and Audi owners to attack Mercedes about 2 product generations ago.

And - those who know my posting history know I am no irrational Lexus fan. Their designs are indeed stodgy and boring to my eye. And yet their value proposition is exactly what Mercedes stood for originally to a certain degree, and I think it admirable that they seem to swim against the stream and make cars known to basically have the potential to outlive their owners (which was the claim that made Rolls Royce great initially in turn - cars that could be inherited from genration to generation, a wise albeit initially stiff investment)."

Has anyone considered the possibility that people have different tastes and tolerances for new technology. Most of the posts read like like authoratative reviews yet I suspect few posters on this thread are anything more than well studied but opinionated consumers. I have in the last 6 months driven many luxury sedans including the LS430, A8L, 745i, 745iL, RS6, E55, S500, S55, XJ-8, XJR... I am overwhelmingly convinced that most automotive reviews are biased either by preconceived notions of the reviewers or financial interests of advertising clientele. The 745i has gotten a bad rap making it one of the best luxury vehicles to buy or lease right now IMO( which since I am a consumer you can take with a grain of salt). I can give anecdotes of people trading in their MB's and LS430's and loving the new BMW just like anyone else can post the opposite. Each car brand and model have their strengths and weaknesses. But the fact that so many are trashing the 745i is great. As a result I've gotten the best buying experience ever in dealing with the 745i. Way better than I have been treated in Lexus or MB dealerships, past or present.
IMO the LS 430 is utterly and completely boring no matter how reliably it performs. MB is simple not worth the premium it demands and its numerous buttons are no easier or more reasonable than idrive. And as long as I'm on the subject of idrive, it can be mastered in a short period of time. It really can, unless taking a few hours with your new vehicle is out of the question. You don't need to be a computer programmer or German. There are actually a lot of people out there that like idrive. They're just not posting on this board or complaining.

For most people, it is out of the question. I owned an previous-generation 740i at the same time as an engineer friend of mine owned his, and I pointed out to him that because he didn't bother to study the manual, he was never aware of half of what his car could do: the details of its trip computer, sound system, climate control, and so on.

He happily admitted I was right. If he didn't know about it, a feature wasn't important to him. He just liked the way the car drove.

iDrive does not afford today's 7-series owner the luxury of mental laziness. If you don't do your homework, you're not going to enjoy this car. Period.

BMW is painfully finding out what today's high school teachers already know: Western society is dumbed down almost beyond recognition. At a time when half of American university freshmen require remedial English because they are unable to comprehend first-year texts, iDrive and related technology is ""too much like work"" to bother absorbing.

All of which is bad news for those of us who are willing to read the docs and reap the benefits of advanced technology.

What irritates me most about the iDrive fiasco is how the automotive press, who should know better, collectively dumped on it.

Did they not realize most iDrive settings are made during a single dedicated setup session, so the car is ""programmed"" to the owner's most detailed specifications? Apparently not. They gave the impression the driver is supposed to fiddle with the iDrive system's multiple levels while actually driving.

Thus misunderstood, BMW's revolutionary user interface probably didn't stand a chance. More's the pity for the rest of us, because any incentive for the manufacturers to experiment with advanced interfaces has just been killed."

When you sit behind the wheel of the car most people are ready to drive, not fiddle with computer technology, which should be passive and in the background. The moment computer technology enters the drivers seat as anything more than passive, a mistake has been made - imo. Even the nav system is annoying - to put in an address - but at least it occurs before you drive and it then remembers your locations for future use. When you sit on the sofa you are ready to be entertained - by a book, a TV show or your stereo. When you sit at a computer your ready to be active and technology challenged if the case presents itself.

Driving is a responsibility so the more you focus on the road the safer it is for everyone. Cell phones are bad enough but fiddling with i-drive to do something to your radio when your cell phone rings would probably drive some people crazy and take their focus off the road and the number 1 responsibility they have while driving.

Except it's not, and this issue is pervasive on many vehicles. Friend just bought a new Honda with Nav. As I sat in it, I asked how to turn the radio on, how do I switch stations, how do I engage the XM, how do I adjust the A/C, how do I use the nav. etc. It wasn't obvious without spending time familiarizing oneself with the vehicle. Even my first ride in a Lexus LS430 I asked, how do I....?

So I can't fault BMW for making one sit down and familiarize themselves with a $75K hi-tech ""German"" vehicle, when I have the same issue in a $28K ""low-tech Japanese"" vehicle. Whether it taks me .5 hour as in the Honda to learn the controls or .75 hour as in the BMW to learn the controls, or 1 hour in the MB to learn the buttons is irrelavent considering I'm going to have the vehicle for some time.

3966,"February 28, 2004 12:48PM",johncalifornia,"In response to Pat's request for discussion of other marques, I pose this question: Is Jaguar making a big mistake building their new XJ series in aluminum?

I think so, because:

1) The XJ is already the lightest model in its class, so losing weight need not be the updated model's first priority.

2) Aluminum vastly increases the costs of manufacture and repair. Even though Ford are setting up additional aluminum body repair facilities across the country, the fact is that a fender bender will result in a long period of down-time for your new Jag. And gawd help you if you have to pay for the repair.

3) Resale value will likely be adversely affected. Though the general public are unaware of Nikasil and weak cam chain tensioner chains, the aluminum cost-of-repair issue got into general knowledge right away. This issue above all, IMHO, is what has tanked the (excellent) Audi A8's resale value. It could do the same to the XJ line.

My conspiracy theory of the day is the Ford is using the Jaguar brand as a guinea pig to assess the possiblities of alumminum bodies cars. If the experiment fails, only a secondary brand is affected. And its owners, of course!

I'm happy to have my steel-bodied, Nikasil engined 1998 XJ8 with its smaller and sleeker form factor. In fact, I'd not trade it for a new X350! (High suplhur gas has been illegal in California since 1996 so Nikasil is a positive here, not a negative.)"

The mode changes from radio to cd to tape etc and the up down switches station or songs on the CD. A layer below that is the volume controls and a layer below that is the on/off switch. Hold down the up/down switch for more than about 5 seconds and it moves to the next CD in the carousel. But you can also adjust the old fashioned way on the dash or the hard way through the audio in the nav system menu. I rarely ever do the latter and nearly always use the steering wheel controls. Occasionally I forget I have all this and reach for the dash controls. It's simple as pie. Never had to be explained it's so simple and in this case - at least to me - using technology for the better and simpler solution.

Pablo - excellent post earlier re MB, Audi, BMW and Lexus. The pot shots taken at Lexus are a clear indication of how successful they've become. The ultimate emulation of MB was in how they build cars the way MB used to. I get your point about overmarketing cutting into prestige and uniqueness. But in the auto world the competition is so fierce it's hard not to overmarket. I'm not sure what the right solution is. There really isn't a clearcut leader anymore. They are all reactive to what the other does. Hence the late entry into SUV's by BMW and the late entry (as planned) by Lexus into tuned cars and MB having to build so many different choices to be all things to all people.

All I want is a wheel, clutch, shift and brake. Don't bother me with even the radio. Other times I'm towing a boat in my Yukon XL with my eyes fixed on the tach and temp gauges. When it comes to luxury I'm Ok with the tech and taking the time to make it work for me. If you consider how much money people spend on the cosmetic issues and options that make their cars unique you would think that a couple of hours invested on ""programming"" their vehicles wouldn't be a big deal. It took me longer to figure out how to order the options on my Porsche than it did to configure the 745i. So I don't think it is an issue of dumping down but rather one of effort and expectation.
Once again my perspective is different. I'm spoiled and have multiple cars. It would be different if I expected everything from one car. I don't blame people for not wanted to program their cars but for me its the best way to get the most out of the technology while customizing the vehicle to my taste.
P.S. My local paper carried an article comparing 2002 and 2003 sales. It suggested that Jaguar sales have been really slipping. I have to say that the new generation of Jaguars seem light years beyond previous offerings without compromising their English nature.

Is it any coincidence how the minimal Porsche 911 has the best resale value yet undergoes the fewest changes to its styling? The performance always gets better, the look has a timeless quality, and for the most part, they are reliable. 40 years of 911 and every model that has ever been made has an interested buyer somewhere. Hopefully Porsche can maintain its independence and simply exist. In my opinion their design philosophy is so right.

I think auto manufacturers have always been too drunk on change. We need cars with a sense of purpose, integrity, experience and heritage. MB and BMW have lost their sense of classic; the Japanese brands never had it and are doing little to establish it.

Too much fashion in automobiles. Wouldn't mind it, but most of the fashion trends just don't work and are relegated to the trash bin of history.

Another car I am rooting for is Jaguar. Too bad they have always been plagued by reliability issues. There's nothing classier than the XJ and XK. Hopefully Ford can honor the design heritage and keep it right.

IMHO Ford have been remarkably scrupulous in retaining the XJ series mystique, but have diluted the brand with the X- and S-series. They seem not to have had a choice -- justifiably, they want the brand to earn a profit.

While I'm concerned about the X350's somewhat bloated styling and aluminum body, at least its look and feel continues the XJ tradition. Other manufacturers -- BMW and Mercedes especially -- have very nearly lost contact with the virtues that made the original 7-series and S-series appealing to enthusiasts.

Still, the word is that the upcoming X-Type will be on its own platform, not a Modeo's. I think Ford have learned from the current model's lukewarm reception by the auotmotive press, and are really trying to do right by the Jaguar brand."

Let's see the E-Class outsells the GS, and the C-Class outsells the IS300. Some here talk about Lexus' sales like everything they make is at the top of the sales charts and nothing could be farther from the truth. Period.

The SL and SC sell nearly equally, despite the SL's much higher price. Wow the LS430 outsold the much more expensive S-Class by something like 2000 units last year, somewhere around a months worth. Wow.

The one point that you and others never seem to be able to get is that most of the Mercedes' competing models cost more than Lexus', yet either outsell or sell very close to the same volume. The only place Mercedes is hurting sales wise compared to Lexus is in SUVs. Mercedes sold way more CARS than Lexus did last year. The GS, old or not, that's and excuse and if it can't be used for the M-Class, then you can't use it for the GS, and the IS300 are duds sales wise.

You're also trying to imply that Mercedes' wouldn't sell much without the C-Class. Wrong. Look at what the E, S, and CLK did last year, all up over 2002, especially the E-Class.

Typical Lexus rant, it's not even current on the facts. There is no C280.

A 400hp GS400H would be nice, but it will still get its windshield and lug nuts handed to it, by an E55 AMG, M5 or RS6. I doubt very seriously Lexus will make a 400hp GS of any type, hybrid or not for the same price as today's GS430.

1988 300SEL, 241,9xx miles, Two owner. Every single maintenance record (every 5k miles) in the glove box.

Now if MB made them like they used to, I'd buy them in an instant! Yes, the car was a bit underpowered with the straight six but the quality of the vehicle is phenomenal! The 16 year old leather looks better than the three year old leather in my STS when I returned it. The dash and all interior materials look great, save for a little fade of the top dash and the wood.

Two weeks in my garage and not ONE single drop of any kind of fluid. Stereo (Becker Grand Prix) works flawless, even the antenna.

Took it in for a wash before I returned it (I decided to take Lexus up on their loaner offer) and the detailer was flabbergasted. He thought it was MAYBE 10 years old.

I'm still a Lexus guy but I definitely know how MB earned their [former] reputation That car is like a vault!

Nothing could be further from the truth.

I have been driving in winter conditions (primarily in the Midwest and in New England) for over thirty years and have racked up an easy quarter of a million miles in the winter alone. In 1979 I switched from RWD cars to FWD cars based upon the ""Hype"" that they were better in the snow. Then in 1999, I switched back to RWD cars (2 BMWs) and as such, I can definitively say that my current car, a 2002 530i with winter tires (Michelin Arctic-Alpin), is the finest car I have ever driven in snowy and slippery conditions.

Considering the fact that we had 114"" of snow in our town last year (I live in southern New Hampshire these days), I have had plenty of opportunities to drive the BMW in snow as deep as 8"" and have had no problems at all. In fact, on one snowy day last January I needed to go and get gas for my generator (the snow and ice had accumulated to the point where the power lines were down all over the place) I was driving down our very hilly and winding main road (which was covered in 6-8"" of heavily rutted snow) minding my own business when I had to slow way down because I caught up to a conga line of 4x4s!

SV7787 said: ""As for Jaguar, I'm in their corner too. I've been thinking about retiring the venerable 92 LS400 in favor of a 01 Xj8. The design of the XJ just shouts out ""Class,"" and Elegance.""

Having owned both the BMW 740i and now a Jaguar XJ8, I suggest the two cars have different missions and are for different drivers, or as in my case, the same driver at different stages of life.

If you want to go fast the 7 will not disappoint. It's not really happy at 75 mph -- it wants to go faster. In the corners it's amazing for such a big car. The cockpit (of the previous 7 at least) is driver-oriented too, like an airplane.

At 75 mph the Jaguar XJ8 is in its element. It's a cruiser that will not embarrass itself in corners but it doesn't urge you to tear through them either.

A few years ago nothing less than the BMW would do -- I could ghost along the freeways at 100 mph in perfect safety and comfort.

Now I don't feel comfortable driving that fast, and I've allowed myself to give in to the walnut-and-leather embrace of the big XJ. (Nobody does leather and wood as well as the English. Nobody is even second.)

If you're coming from a Cadillac or Lexus, Jaguar could be your car. You'll know within five minutes of undertaking your test drive.

Today I was in a co-worker's '97 XJ6. He's had 135K trouble-free miles, and he says he drives the crap out of it. My '98 is a different generation and I expect nothing less of an experience in reliability and owner loyalty.

My point is, I was ready for a more ""stately"" sedan when I made the transition from German cars to English. Like Cadillacs of many years ago, Jaguar provides a luxurious and conservative driving experience with excellent reliability -- and there's plenty of motor when you put your foot down.

If you want to strafe apexes or tear up the autobahn, though, there are better choices than Jaguar XJ8. (The XJR is one of them!)"

3991,"March 2, 2004 6:26AM",designman,"ksurg, I enjoyed your description of the Porsche experience with one reservation. With regard to the 911 you said ""it is not lightning fast nor does it have the best spec sheet."" I appreciate the modest perspective but would like to add this to keep it in PROPER perspective. There is bragging-rights fast and there is lightning fast. THE 911 IS LIGHTNING FAST ;-)

The Porsche experience is about driving perfection, and the ""luxury"" of the Porsche brand is its ultimate combination of form and function. But one of the most eloquent, powerful descriptions of the Porsche experience I have ever heard comes from the February 2004 issue of Automobile magazine when they gave all-star awards to cars in 14 categories. The Boxster was the recipient in the sports-car category. What overwhelmed me is that it not only qualifies the Boxster but it also speaks volumes about the manufacturer and the revered 911 by default. I could not possibly put it into words any better than this:

 ""The two seat roadster segment is based largely on impulse and emotion. New roadsters sell well for a few years until they are deemed passe by the mix of enthusiasts and poseurs who consume them. In this constantly evolving segment, the Boxster is so immediately perfect and timeless that only slight tweaks are necessary to keep it on top. Porsche knows when to change, and more important, when change is unnecessary. A true Porsche, the Boxster feels crafted instead of merely built. It is beautiful to behold, still or in motion, and even better when you are the one putting it in gear. Boxsters speak so clearly through the controls that driving becomes an existential quandary of human getting lost in machine, in the snarl of the flat-six and the gentle pulsing of the leather wrapped steering wheel. Cynics will claim that there are less expensive sports cars that duplicate, or even surpass, a Boxster&#146;s quantifiable abilities, but none has its noble grace, which is rarely found in machines at any price. Mesmerizing and involving, the Boxster is a living being in a segment full of automations."""

BMW offers 4 powertrains from the grossly underpowered 525 to the lightning fast M5.

I think the problem with Mercedes begun when they switched from DOHC 4 valve per cylinder to SOHC 3 valve per cylinder in 1998. All the pre 1998 Mercedes were built to last forever, the same cannot be said for the current generation. It is good to know that Mercedes learned their lesson and going back to DOHC engines.

The Audi blows it away as far as I am concerned. And you know where the Audi stands with me. The Audi also blows it away in looks - imo. This wasn't a road comparo - it was just a review of a new entrant vs an established one with luxury as the benchmark. What is funny though is that there are 100k large sedan lux cars sold each year - give or take - and these two will only represent 6% of those sales. I'm not at all sure why the A8 sells so poorly given all that Audi puts into it (engineering wise and marketing wise - I do see plenty of A8 advertisements) as well as its competitive price. It's a great car and deserves better but the Maserati Q looks like it better be kept to a low production quota. It's a name people will aspire to, and it's a sports car people will aspire to but as a lux car it will probably disappoint (except for the fact that it's a Maserati, its different and thus will get a lot of stares) - unless you really want a 4 door sports car and not a lux car."

Gee, that is exactly the point I was trying to make, and you understood it perfectly. The root of MB's problems is having to adjust to that. Older models also stayed in production for 10 years or more in some cases. This practice is no longer competitive, and 7 years is about the norm now. The Germans are still learning how to build a cheaper car in less time, for less time and for less money, not their specialty.

Nope, I haven't driven the A8 or Phaeton. Yes, I have driven the entire 7-Series range. I drove the 745Li and 760Li. I was able to keep the 760Li for about an hour since nobody else was in line to drive it BMW's charity event last fall. Awesome car, but too complicated to master in such a short drive. It's not even idrive that bothers me most it's the styling. I simply can't stand it. Now believe it or not, I'm starting to like the 5-Series. Gulp!

Well you know how much I like the A8, but I'm quite fond of the Quattroporte too. The biggest mistake Maserati made with the Quattroporte is not offering a conventional automatic transmission. Thus it will remain a sports car with 4 doors. I look for their connection with Audi to yield them a proper 6-speed auto in a few years. I think the car will sell well though because people looking for regular luxury cars, MB/Lexus/BMW etc, aren't going to be interested, and those who want something different with 4 doors have just found their ride.

The SL55 AMG remains my favorite car on the market period. Either that or a CL. No Boxster for me, surprisingly I've never like it much.

Unless you know something I don't, 1998's change over to SOHC isn't even close to being one of MB's problems. The new SOHC engines are much simpler compared to the old DOHC I6 and V8s, which were great, or better depending on who you ask, but they weren't perfect either.

Leasing was a natural occurrence for volume to be maintained or increased as the prices rose. MB would not have been able to sustain that 80's type of business model profitably long-term unless they became a small niche company. The very high prices opened the door for competion, hence Lexus, and at the same time brought about the desire to drive high luxury cars with minimal money down while your money was put to better use elsewhere. It was actually a normal business check and balance effect and one can argue that the Japanese anticipated this better than the Germans in 1989. This is the business side of auto manufacturing. A new entrant has to change the rules to be successful.

You are correct - the Germans have to learn to build the cars differently in today's highly competitive market and at the same MB has to maintain an image above everyone else somehow in doing it. That is no easy task particularly given that mastering sophisticated electronics (which is a big part of the problem) favors the Japanese. In the past they were able to build the best and charge the most and then people held the cars for a lomg long time. Even though the cars were expensive the value was excellent because of the ownership longevity. But that was a different market in a different era before the technology and Wall street booms.

As others have stated, Audi has an image problem in the country. The unintended acceleration problem isn't on too many people's minds today, but I'm sure it hasn't been completely forgotten. When I think of the idiots behind that it makes me sick. It's funny how none of those cases ever showed a defect with the car. Audi was guilty of placing the pedals in their manual transmission cars too close together for fat American's feet. You know heel and toe style. Anyway, it's pretty much Pablo stated, people just don't think as high of Audi as they do BMW and MB in this country. Their associate with VW doesn't help either, plus the reliability concerns all conspire to keep Audi below BMW and MB when it comes to the A8. Believe it or not even Audi's really hot cars like the RS6 sell out like E55s and M5s do. The dealer here has 3 of them, and has had them for a while now. The E55 moves much faster and the new M5 will be all but unobtainable this fall/winter. Audi just doesn't have the draw with the rich like BMW, and they're even further away from Mercedes-Benz. Mercedes can just about sell whatever they put a star on, not even BMW (Z8, 760Li are examples) can so easily do this.

However the A8 just had its best sales year ever in this country, a whopping 4K cars!! With a new W12 model coming this fall, and a rumor short wheelbase model also arriving at the same time, they might be able to move 5K a year. Still only half of what the XJ does, and about 1/4 of what the S, LS and 7-Series do.

How do you think the Germans should solve their reliability problems? First, they got to admit it. Before you can solve a problem, you've to admit you have it. MB's beginning to, I'm not sure VW and BMW know they've a problem.

Second, do not be at the forefront of electronics. I don't think many people will miss idrive. Let the Japanese try out the new electronics in the cars first, and stay half a step behind them. The saying, 'Americans are best at computers, Japanese electronics, German mechanical things' still stands. People buy German cars not because of electronics, but in spite of them.

Third, establish some research centers in Japan, and in China in the future. The Japanese have design and research centers in California and Europe. The big 3 and Germans have zero centers in Japan, I think. They're saying they don't have anything to learn from Japan. Well they're wrong!"

I agree that it was solidly built but was more costly to maintain than my 1990 LS which had 100K more miles. The MB was much larger and made the LS look like a compact. Even the MB lovers out there have to be glad that Lexus came along since the sales price on that 1988 exceeded the sales price on the 2004 LS he bought to replace it. Time will tell if the LS holds up as well and is a 16 year keeper. I just replaced my 1990 LS with a 2004 LS as well and went to the Chicago Auto show the day before I closed the deal. I was surprised that the Phaeton was up on a carousel and unavailable to be more closely inspected. How VW misses an opportunity to take business from MB, Lexus, BMW, etc. owners is beyond me.

Of course, the 7 looks like someone put a big square box in the trunk and then shut it with a metal press.

Even though there's supposed to be a single designer behind these cars, I also still liken the new 5 and 7 to camels, which of course are horses designed by a committee.

As a BMW owner and long-time fan, Lord knows I've tried to get some growth on E60, but it just isn't happening.

With regard to the CLS, I'm pulling my hair out over it because it is so close yet so far on my score sheet. My first impression was very positive sleek, curvaceous and aerodynamic. I believe they had great aspirations with the curves, but the curves are lacking in sophistication too simple. For instance, the curve of the beltline, and the crease just beneath the beltline, are just too darn symmetrical and parallel.

And I don&#146;t like how my attention is always drawn to the rear door. It&#146;s the wedge working. The front is a little squeezed. Compare the areas just above the front and rear wheels disparate framing some bulk in the doors.

I like the treatment of the front lamps, but they clearly copied Porsche although not as shapely as Porsche.

I really wish they would lose that pinched-putty treatment of the trunk it&#146;s just so out of nowhere.

I&#146;ve always liked five-spoke wheels but these need a little shape and change in direction not enough thought in them.

MB interiors have always been kind to my taste but this one is a potpourri of random, uncalculated shapes. I particularly don&#146;t care for the circular vents and heavy application of wood.

For the most part I like the exterior of the CLS, particularly the grand aerodynamic picture, but I don&#146;t I believe it was finessed enough rushed a little too sketchy. I have to believe the diversity across MB model platforms has precluded the nth degree of effort that a fully implemented design deserves. But due to the disposable, just-do-it world we now live, I fear this is becoming the norm across the board."

4039,"March 6, 2004 1:03PM",shipo,"While I cannot speak for VCheng, I can opine for myself. An automatic is an automatic is an automatic. No matter how many do-it-yourself shifter devices they invent, it's still an automatic. IMHO, nothing can replace a conventional manual transmission with a third pedal style of clutch, nothing. What's the difference you ask? After all shifting is shifting, right? Nope. With a true clutch (as in foot operated), you have an infinitely variable speed of engagement ranging from feathery soft to slammin' so hard that the glove box involuntarily egresses its entire contents on the passengers' seat (or lap as the case may be). Done right, a car with a manual transmission is smoother or faster or both, depending upon the mood of the driver. Then of course there is the mileage to consider, not that buyers of ""High End Luxury Marques"" pay too much attention to mileage. That said, I kind of like the fact that my 530i 5-Speed gets about 31mpg on road trips and has averaged a little over 25 mpg in its first two years with me.

So, for my money (and I suspect for VCheng's as well) only a transmission with a stick and a third pedal need apply. ;-)

4042,"March 7, 2004 11:02AM",ksurg,"Hands down you will get a better lease deal on the 745i. Why? Mostly because the relatively low residual on the A8L as compared to the 745i. Other factors to consider include a more comprehensive scheduled maintenance program on the BMW and higher insurance premiums on the Audi( due to its aluminum construction). Intellichoice rates the 745i as excellent and the A8l as average in terms of cost and reliability. Even Edmunds has the A8L as having a higher true cost of ownership.
From an option standpoint the BMW doesn't have four wheel drive but the A8 is not yet available in a SWB model.
Lastly its hard to talk about reliability and get trustworthy info, especially since the A8L is so new. My personal experience having owned an A6 4.2 and 540i was that the Audi had far more problems but most of them were not serious and were fixed promptly by the dealership. I recently was in your position and went with the 745i because the deals were to good to pass up. So far I love the car. The whole quirky idrive thing is beyond me... everything seems intelligently if not intuitively designed despite what you read on this page( keep in mind that idrive before '04 may have been a different animal).

I got it that way because I couldn't get an inexpensive vehicle with the multi-functionality like an Element that also had TRAC and VSC (yet). So I prefer the freedom that the manual gives me in inclement weather.

If it had TRAC/VSC to go along with the ABS/EBD, I would have bought a AWD/Automatic in a blink.

Cars with TRAC/VSC/EBD/ABS, etc. flat out drive everyone but a very good professional driver. The Porsche Cayenne / VW Toureg being a very good example.

If you have ever driven an old (old by today's date, but current day at the time of driving) Fiat, BMW, Aston Martin, even VW Bug, you would know the difference a left foot clutch guiding/right hand gear shifting/body tensioning/total control feeling experience makes. It's a total body experience that has no equal in today's electronic push button/flip switch controls. I, for one, have come to accept the change. But I surely miss the subtle physical choices a true manual transmission permits. They are just not the same.

Any other thoughts??"

Now I must be clear, only the models with the bigger wheels and tires are ""actually attractive"" imo. The folks who buy the 525i and 530i with the standard wheels are still getting a car I can't whole heartedly endorse as being good looking, none of the 5-Series models are for that matter. However I kinda see what Bangle was going for with the 5-Series, I can't explain it, but I'd say he did a much better job on the 5 than he did the 7. Trust me it still isn't an E-Class or A6 (previous model) to me..so I wouldn't say I'd done quite a 180 degree turn, but it does look at lot better than the 7-Series.

As always I enjoy your analysis on styling, the reason I asked your opinion of the CLS in the first place. Ah...the CLS, another car I'm starting like more and more, though it is about as far away from traditional MB design as possible. Your comments about its shape, lines and treatments are spot on, imo. I personally would have liked a blocky or more squarish back end like the S on the CLS. I agree about the interior, though my problem is more or less they used too many E-Class pieces, this car should have been completely different and daring, like the exterior is, for a MB that is.

____________

The transmission debate. No automatic or SMG, F1, or DSG type tranny will take the place of a true 3-pedal, lever operated manual for the purest of enthusiasts. No question. That said, my vote for the next best thing is Audi's DSG gearbox. The transmission is different from the rest of the automated manuals out there right now. Unlike the SMG/F1 type trannnies offered by BMW, Ferrari, Aston-Martin, Mercedes, Toyota, and Maserati, the Audi DSG unit functions pretty well in automatic mode, which truth be told is how most of these trannies will be operated most of the time, otherwise the person would have bought the traditional manual in the first place. The Audi system uses dual clutches and doesn't give that jerky, hesitation of all the other auto/manuals. Test drive the Audi TT 3.2 if you don't believe me. No it still doesn't shift as seamlessly as regular torque converter automatic, but its real close and much smoother than BMW's M3 SMG system is in automatic mode. Ferrari and Toyota MR2 owners complain the loudest about how awful there F1-style trannies behave in automatic mode while in stop-n-go traffic. I've hear similar stories about the Aston-Martin Vanquish and Maserati Sypder too. Which is why I'm shocked that Maserati would see a luxury sedan, the Quattroporte with essentially the same (with some changes) gearbox.

A regular automatic with manual shifting capability isn't even close to comparing to a true manual when it comes to feeling in control of or being at one with the car.

4046,"March 8, 2004 1:09AM",merc1,"There was a recent Automobile magazine article that stated ""there is an old joke that says BMW's marketing is determined in Stuttgart"", meaning that BMW's product lineup is influenced by Mercedes-Benz. For what MB does, BMW must answer in most cases, but vice versa also applies, but most of the time MB does the leading.

Car and Driver has also stated that these two companies have more effect on each other than their competition does. This was stated most recently in their comparison of the CLK55 AMG and M3 a while back.

Autospies recently published photos from the Detroit show showing BMW head designer, Chris Bangle and some other top BMW execs inspecting the Mercedes GST concept crossover.

It is reported that BMW now has at the very least has a plan on the drawing board to develop a GST like vehicle. So far the rumor mill has them pegged as the V-Series: V3, V5 and possibly a V7..you know to mirror the X3, X5 and the once proposed X7.

Now Automotive News is showing BMW CEO Helmut Panke in the front seat of the CLS 500, while BMW production Chief Burkhard Göschel ""looks on"" at the Geneva motor show.

Now of course BMW has influenced Mercedes to *try* and go sportier, especially with the C-Class. The C-Class for 2005 gets another round of chassis improvements in keeping with this belief of BMW's influence.

Will Mercedes go for an idrive like system in the 2006 S-Class? Will BMW build a 4-door Coupe-like vehicle if the CLS is a hit?

CTS had the idea, but Cien has the details. It&#146;s a perfect study in assymetry... complex, striking proportions yet extremely balanced. I particularly like the harmony among flat and curved surfaces.

If Cien ever makes it to the street, I would seriously consider it based on style alone. Any brains, performance and reliability that comes with it would only be icing on the cake. Too much to ask for? I suppose so. But this is not your father&#146;s Cadillac, and it&#146;s no Allante. I really hope they can make a go of it and shed that stigma.

One thing of interest is that they thought the S-class ride was actually a tad bit better and more sullen than the LS430 which is the exact opposite of what I have found in the past. This however is the ultimate battle as both cars have phenomenal ride quality. It's clear that CR considers the S and LS the best mass production cars on the planet but the S loses out because of poor reliability. The other thing is that the S is only average in customer satisfaction which must be tied to a combination of its poor reliability and high anticipations of the buyer. The LS scored highest marks possible in all categories including depreciation. 7 series was considered to miss the mark as a luxury sedan (my take is because of the difficulty with iDrive and performing ordinary tasks whilee driving) and scored awful in reliabilty and average in satisfaction and depreciation. It was considered very quiet but lacking a great ride. The A8 is too new to be rated (as was the Phaeton) but its clear CR was quite impressed with it. The Jag was considered a classic car but its ride, interior comfort and quietness trailed the S and LS. The Q scored high in reliabilty but misses the mark as a world class car.

The Passat tied in a top category as it had average reliabilty. The Passat commercial with the woman test driving a car and passing an unmarked state trooper is one of the best auto ads I've seen recently. The look on the troopers face as he's passed, the auto salesman's face when he realizes what just happened and the excitement on the woman's face as she looks at the auto saleman for approval to pass beforehand all desreve Clio awards.

By the way CR is a BMW fan and in the past has said the 5-series is the best car they've ever driven.

It's inevitable that euro sales will fall at the high price levels that exist today unless the quality comes back. In the past depreciation was exceptional for many Euro lux brand. But now it is average and even poor in some cases. The Japanese cars are starting to get the grades Euro cars used to get in depreciation and customer satisfaction.

4054,"March 9, 2004 12:31PM",sv7887,"Hi All,
  I hope this isn't the beginning of another Lexus vs MB debate..The BMW statistic doesn't surprise me. The 1996 LS was alot less complicated than the current 7 series. Obviously the more complicated the system the more issues that can arise with it. From my own personal experience, my 92 LS has had fewer issues than my LS430. Of course the cars differ greatly in complexity.

  Anyone want to postulate reasons for the European issues? (I'm NOT trying to start another Lex vs Germany thread here..) My feelings are that the autos are heavily concentrating on cramming electronics into these cars at a torrid pace. That works to the Japanese competitive advantage, as they are the unrivaled leader in this sort of thing. I think the main issues for the Euro automakers are electronics related. I somehow doubt I'd see a BMW, MB, or Jag with Engine or transmission issues..

Your thoughts?

4055,"March 9, 2004 1:49PM",ljflx,"The problem is that the 7-series didn't need to be all that more complex than the 96 LS400. BMW went there because of a desire to lead in electronic auto technology. The real issue is whether the Germans will let the Japanese lead here because they are no match for the Japanese in electronics. My bet is that pride will not allow it and the quality slide will continue.

No - I don't want another Lexus vs MB debate either. We've been down that road a few too many times. But 10 - 15 years ago would anyone have ever thought the ratings would look like this for the Germans?"
4056,"March 9, 2004 2:19PM",prattster,"Well, I'll bet pride has some bearing but then Porsche is using Japan supplier Aisin for the Cayenne transmission and that's one of the most complicated components in any car. It's that same pride that got the domestics buried in the 70's-80's. I'll bet 10-15 years back, German manuf. thought that the luxury market was all locked up for them, well til 86'(Legend)I guess but 89' was the 1st wake-up call.

Japanese don't just make great electronics, their mechanical stuff is top notch also as in long life engines. It's no surprise that Boeing awarded Japanese suppliers to do the electrical systems for their new upcoming jetliner. Talk about complicated electrical."
4057,"March 9, 2004 3:04PM",shipo,"Hmmm, I know very well that the hype says that they are virtually flawless; however, my experience has been anything but that.

My last (and only) Japanese car (a Mazda 626) was a nightmare (many mechanical and electrical failures), and interestingly enough, the only car I've ever had that had a transmission failure, and it was a 5-Speed manual. My last American car that had any failures at all (four American cars ago) had only two failures, the fuel pump, made in Japan, and the alternator, also made in Japan. Go figure.

Don't get me wrong, I believe that on the whole, the Japanese build generally more reliable products that do the Americans or the Europeans. Of course, then I look over to the next two houses on my street where a Honda Odyssey and two Accords live. One of the Accords is a 4-Banger with a 5-Speed manual transmission, and other than a bad cat (something like $1,200 to replace), it has been quite reliable. The Odyssey and the other Accord have required three transmissions between them. Hmmm, then again, maybe it's all hype.

Shipo someday take a lease on one of the top 3 and see if your attitude changes. Just test drive an MB or a Lexus or a BMW, it is a totally different experience then driving an old Accord or 626."
4059,"March 9, 2004 4:47PM",shipo,"Sorry guy, I've owned four Audi's and I am now on my second BMW, a 530i this time that I had the pleasure of picking up in Munich and running it through its paces on the Autobahn. If that's not enough, I spent several years in the mid 1990s working for MB-USA in Montvale and Stuttgart, and I drove everything they had as well as all of their competitors that they would buy and MAKE us drive for a week at a time, just to get the feel of them. As such, I think I am very well versed in what the various cars have to offer.

That said, I stand by my statements, Japanese engineering is, IMHO, overrated. They're good, but there nowhere near as good as the hype would have folks believe. The opposite is true for the American and European manufacturers; they are not as bad as the rhetoric from the Japanese loving public would have us believe.

Oh, and FWIW, the Odyssey and the two Accords are not very old, maybe four years for the oldest. The 626 on the other hand was a 1993 model.

4060,"March 9, 2004 5:19PM",pat,"This ""argument"" about reliability never gets us anywhere but in trouble.

Anecdotal evidence is just that - there are those of us who want to rely on it, and those of us who don't. Whatever - we're all entitled to our own points of view.

Why don't we just talk about what we like about these vehicles and where we think the manufacturers can improve instead of getting into yet another ""my car/opinion is better than yours"" debate?

It's not worth it. There are really great cars in this category, and there is no reason for any of us to pursue these turf wars. All of the cars that fit the topic here have characteristics that many appreciate, and yet they all seem to have some minuses - can't we talk about these things without the territorial ground-pawing and snorting that seems to come with defensiveness about personal choices?

And we do need to remember our subject ... we're getting into vehicles that none of us believe belong here."
4061,"March 9, 2004 9:03PM",sv7887,"Hi All,
  Back to the topic I posed...Should the auto manufacturers continue to cram all these electronics into cars? I somehow don't see my LS430 holding up as wel as my original LS400 has over 12 years..There are simply too many electronic gimmicks in the car. Perhaps I'm wrong, but it seems like these cars are not being designed to be trouble free as the old MB's and original LS cars.

 You're all going to call me crazy, but Lexus owners, sit in an original LS and then in a new one..You'll notice the switches are lesser quality, and the car doesn't exude the solidness that the original did. The numbers even tell the tale. In 1990, it was estimated the car cost around $42-45K to manufacture. (Leading MB to charge Toyota was dumping the vehicles in the US market) Two years back when I bought my 430 the invoice price was around 50K. Maybe this is why I probably won't keep the car beyond it's warranty which expires next September.
I firmly believe what some have posted here: Automakers should offer simpler versions of their cars. What do you all think?

4062,"March 9, 2004 10:48PM",merc1,"I remember the concept clearly...the Cadillac Cien. I agree on the styling, it was a gorgeous and edgy excercise. It carried Cadillac's new styling theme better than anything since, especially the CTS and XLR, both of which could use some softening, imo.

shipo,

Be careful with that view expressed in your post #4376 particularly that second paragraph, as the surveys and CR rule this board, nothing else matters, including knowledge about the cars themselves, CR/JDP history or anything else. A Buick is a better car than anything German.

4063,"March 10, 2004 6:36AM",designman,"shipo... I agree with the overrated/underrated extremes that car buyers go to as you suggest. As a note, my father bought a Hyundai around the time they first came out. Geez was it tinny and couldn&#146;t get out of its own way, but it just kept running to my surprise and delight.

sv7887... If I could have one wish granted with cars, it would probably be to reduce the electronics and gimmickry. I agree it is out of hand and getting worse. There are more heating zones in luxury cars than there are in most homes. My wife brought our 03 BMW 530 in for a simple oil change yesterday and it comes back with the computer reset. The on/off characteristics of the lights are now in a manual mode. So now I have to make another trip back to get it reset to our preferences. Wouldn&#146;t mind if you could do it yourself, like resetting the radio stations, but you become dealer-dependent. The proprietary aspect also handcuffs us.

merc1... gear up sir. What with the latest CR deal I think German cars are going to be taking a beating around these threads whether it is deserved or not. It wouldn&#146;t trouble me though. Living in the shadow of big brother 911 and less expensive stars like the S2000 and 350Z, my Boxster often takes a pounding. But I know exactly what I want and am very comfortable with where my passions lie. In the end, however, I think the fierce competition is very healthy for all brands. And as much as I disagree with many of the posters, I am thoroughly entertained by their takes and the candor we couldn't possibly find in a cocktail conversation. You have to admit, this place is a gas.

4065,"March 10, 2004 7:26AM",ljflx,"Don't know what you see in your car but I've had the 95, 98 and 2001 LS430's and they just keeping getting better and better. I'm about to take a 2004 LS430 and gave some serious thought to buying out my 2001 because it is so good. Interior is better than ever and I don't see any departure from the excellent switch gear that has been in the car in the past. I don't think they've ever changed it nor do they need to. I'll tell you what is best of all. My lease on the 2004 - which if I get the car I want - will have a $62k sticker (but I may opt for the full ultra lux model) and will price out at $10 a month less than the 1995 I had which had a $56.5k sticker. The 2004 is naturally a safer car and has far more equipment included. I realize some of that is interest rate reduction but some of it is also because the LS430 now has one of the highest residual values in the industry.

merc1 - you'd look great behind the wheel of a Buick. All kidding aside - the NY news media and evening reports had a field day with BMW and Mercedes yesterday. I hope the German execs were paying attention because it's reports like those - which are widespread and can't be missed or forgotten - that make reality overtake perception. You don't think Buick will play up that tidbit as future marketing hype?"
4066,"March 10, 2004 8:45AM",edspider1,"I don't think it makes a lot of sense to compare old model reliability with new models. The market demands technology. The market for 2004 MY cars with 1990 technology is tiny.

When I moved to Lexus from MB in 2001 it wasn't because of quality, it was because of features. Only in the last year or so did I connect the absence of LS problems compared to my 98 E Class experience. The MB was out of pocket for 40 days while they replaced the engine. The parking lights would burn out every 60 days until a recall finally fixed the problem.

Lucky for me I still see Lexus has having the highest techology and I get the quality build as a bonus! They don't have all the gadgets though. Lexus botched XM radio. Their NAV lacks the 3D birdeye view. They still haven't made radar pre-crash available. There is no display showing what audio system is playing."

sv7887...Sometimes I do wish that the autos were simpler. I really liked my 1992 Q45 because of its uncluttered dash and relative simplicity. I don't recall having any problems during my 24 month lease. On the other hand, I enjoyed all the gadgets on my LS430 and RX330 and haven't experienced any problems with them.

4068,"March 10, 2004 9:07AM",johncalifornia,"The Consumer Reports staff know their cars, but it's the readers who determine the reliability ratings by sending in their votes, right?

If so, these ratings are statistically bogus from the get-go. If report submission is voluntary, and if it's from a non-representative sector (Consumer Reports readers do not represent MY interests or preferences!), then the data is flawed and the results are worthless.

For example, I'd wager that Jaguar owners who subscribe to CR are an anomaly within the Jag-buying demographic. (Whereas Buick-owning CR subscribers are probably represntative for the fuddy-duddy Buick-owning demographic.) My guess is that Jag-owning CR readers are made up substantially of traditional American-car buyers who have decided to ""take a flyer."" They ecountered more service issues than they expected, and thus Jag models get low ratings.

NO volunary owner surveys are going to generate good statistics. You need to research actual shop records and manufacturer data for the brand. All the rest is highly suspect, and I think tends to favor the status quo.

Why is JD Power so highly regarded? Because the manufacturers quote it all the time in their advertising. Circular reasoning aside, it's a somewhat too-cozy relationship for my comfort.

While I'm not completely dismissing these surveys, I think they should be regarded with skepticism and not the sole determinant of a person's choice of auotmobile."
4069,"March 10, 2004 10:23AM",mariner7,"But isn't JD Power giving pretty much the same picture as CR? And that survey by the biggest drivers association in Germany, it said the same thing, didn't it?

One interesting thing is how the Swedes are doing so much better than the Germans. Aren't two Saabs (their entire lineup) and three Volvos on CR recommended list? The Germans place two or three on it. Weren't the Swedes in quality trouble just a couple of years ago?

If the Germans studied how the Swedes turned it around, their problem will be forgotten in a few years. And I expect them to."
4070,"March 10, 2004 11:44AM",sv7887,"Hi All,
  In comparing the quality of an early 1990's Lexus to those of today I was attempting to make a statement of Absolute Quality. I've had a 92,98,and currently a '02 LS430. I paid $42.5K in 1992, $59K in 1998 and $64K in 2002. I buy cash and not lease, b/c I like to hold on to them if possible. I do realize that the trend has moved toward leasing..I guess I am one of the old timers.

My statement simply concerned the solidness that the old car possessed. Feel the switches and controls in the new cars, they don't have the solid feel that a W126 MB or original LS does. The chrome on the radiators are thinner, and the switches have this tinny feel to them. Call me crazy, but I thought I'd put it out there.

My previous post questioned the validity of the Technology craze in today's cars. I believe that Absolute quality has fallen as a result. Does anyone think these cars are built to last 20 years like a W126 MB or 90 LS? Keep in mind I'm talking about Long Term ownership here (>5 yrs) I point to my statement from my last post: The more complicated the design, the more issues you'll have. What do you all think?

But - seeing big headlines in the major papers highlighting the 'unreliablity' of German cars will help form the perception of the public.
Most consumers are not real car junkies and will just skim a small part of the information that is available.

Merc/BMW/Audi management is well advised to take the quality/reliability issue very seriously.
At 47, I am old enough to remember how Cadillac management and fans dismissed negative feedback 25-30 years ago. It is much less costly in the long run to maintain brand image than to try to restore it once it is lost.

4073,"March 10, 2004 2:07PM",6sn7s,"Are CR and JDP accurate? It depends!

Car surveys are like TV surveys.... we know it is inaccurate from year to year but that is fine because you cannot possibly control for all anomalies!

However in the lager scheme of things the data is vaild because the effects are cumulative in nature - they take samples every year - such that after a number of years the picture gets more accurate and increases in accuracy the longer a trend can be traced.

For example, Lexus has won so many awards for so many years in JDP and CR that you really would be hard pressed fault the data. That is assuming of course the test itself is 'valid' - testing what it suppose to.

On the other hand, if you get a car model that seems to be good for only one year, it may just be an anomaly.

Moral: So when quoting such data, like all things in life, context is critical... think trends not individual years!"
4074,"March 10, 2004 2:08PM",ljflx,"Scott and Vcheng - great points.

vcheng - I do think some of these cars will go 15-20 years but there are so few buyers who want to hold them more than 5 years anyway. The market has moved on due to acceleration of auto improvements and stronger than ever competition.

Scott - I remember the Cadillac denial also and the MB/BMW version is a mirror image of it. But you know what - it happens in business all the time - in every industry - and it could happen to Lexus and the Japanese in the future as well.

CR - not statistically weighted but always on the leading edge and well respected and believed in. Witness all the press coverage it got yesterday. As well getting a statistically weighted car sample is not the same as getting a statistically weighted TV viewership behavior sample ala Nielsen's TV ratings. CR won't publish the data if there is not enough volume from its members hence the NA's on the newest cars. Where it has the volume - and it has plenty for cars like the LS430 and S-class - it publishes its survey results."
4075,"March 10, 2004 2:53PM",6sn7s,"I understand what you're saying.

My comments have more to do with addressing the general comments and issues that the data these companies produced is invalid.

Issues like audience sampling size, where they got the samples from, or whether the buyers of certain brands have unique characteristics that may slant the ratings.

These are all good points but people also need to realize that given a long enough testing period and a large enough data base these anomalies will work themselves out.

The question then becomes, how big is big enough and how long is long enough? Again, it would depend on a variety of factors too numerous and too boring to discuss here.

Suffice to say that these testing methods are probably - I don't have all the details on their methods - as good as it gets, in stats nothing is absolute, just a best guess.... a really good guess though : D"

Meager as that may be as a representation of the US population - it is well modelled and statistically weighted - it is still the best measurement out there. I wonder how many people knew their sample is that small. Just think of all the auto advertising that is based on that small sample.

-All car companies need an edge to differentiate themselves from the pack.It can be styling, gadgetry, safety devices, pricing, buid quality etc. On the area of electronics-digital gadgets are permeating almost all facets of the car and have definite advantages that can be used to descriminate on performance (e.g.faster braking; less weight by using non-mechanical parts etc.) and cost of production. It's a calculated bet that automakers make every year on what gadgets or functionalities to introduce. I just think that some companies get hurried up by marketing deadlines and product intros that they screw up a lot.Toyota makes mistakes too, but I notice that they stabilize their production line quality first before they introduce widespread changes and will delay introduction of new functions/gadgets for the sake of perceived quality,even for 1-2 years behind.

When Gallup does a political poll or any other poll, the responses are also voluntary. And the results are, while not perfect, still generally in the ballpark. If one candidate leads another by 2:1 on election eve, you don&#146;t typically see the actual result come out 1:2.

&#147;You need to research actual shop records and manufacturer data for the brand.&#148; This is a good idea, but I have another that requires less work, maybe you or someone else would like to pursue it: Take two equally-priced cars from different manufacturers, and call up third-party extended warranty companies to get quotes on extended warranty coverage. My guess is that the results would generally track the CR/JDP and other surveys (I am guessing so because I believe the survey data are actually pretty good, but I welcome you to prove me wrong using actual research).

Survey work &#147;tends to favor the status quo&#148;. A supposition and I&#146;ll counter with my own supposition. If someone buys say a Lexus believing that it is more reliable than others, but ends up having problems, isn&#146;t he MORE likely to want to complain about it as compared to an MB buyer who was already aware of a poor quality reputation?

Part of the luxuty/high end expectation of these cars is feeling/knowing you are getting a car that will work better than anything out there. Why else would you spend $60k+ or make a $30k-$40k lease committment. Hence it is as hard to remove from the discussion as ride quality and handling quality. It will always come back.

The money spent on technology should be sub-divided into what is good for the enviroment(hybrid technology, increasing gas mileage, keeping the air cleaner etc), what is bad, downright stupid and wasteful (I-drive, cars that park themselves, electronics created for bragging rights), what is desired (technology that improves handling, ride quality, stability etc) and technology that improves safety, driver comfort/fatigue etc - among others.

The spending on electronics should be focused on need not bragging. I-drive is a disaster. Toyota's car that park themselves are disaters in the making. Such a car would would probably need about a 12 hour time frame to complete the job in midtown Manhattan the way taxis and people would interefere with its laser detection equipment. The thing would look like a pin ball bouncing around an energetic pin ball machine. I thought of my Lexus with dual front climate controls (some MB's have 4-zone climate control) - for a space of what - 15 to 30 feet with no boundaries!

As for the rest of the new BMW 7 series it has an award winning engine and superlative handling. It really doesn't matter to me what others on this page think. I just believe it's too bad that anything that doesn't carry a Lexus or MB badge is dismissed without genuine consideration.
As for new technology give all of us a break. It would be absolutely ridiculous not to push ahead. Does anyone actually think that cars will not evolve in many areas... some good and some wasteful. For that matter is there a single vehicle on this thread that isn't wasteful. I get the sense that most of the people on this page are very set in their ways and expectations. What is going on in car market isn't meant for the over 50 crowd. What are the demographics of this thread anyway?
The single best tangent I've seen was the discussion of upcoming hybrid technology. Maybe we could branch off on some other such issues."

VW has clearly stated that they have a problem and that they are also working on it, yet for this board and the survey clutchers only the articles about the denials a while back matter. Sounds like MB couldn't care less about quality to me. Why else would they say they're doing something about a problem they don't think they have.

This should explain it somewhat. Basically the trans. gears are gone and replaced with a much smoother belt shift. The new Murano has it currently and some Audi's. Honda first had in the 96' Civic but the new units are high torque units that Nissan debuted first in the article."
4101,"March 11, 2004 12:40PM",shipo,"CVT = Continuously Variable Transmission = No Gears

Gear ratios are approximated by running one or more parallel ""V"" belts between paired grooved wheel sets, two on the powered side and two on the driven side per belt, which can independently and dynamically change their amount of separation, thus allowing infinite gear ratios between two preset extremes.

For simplicities sake, I will attempt to illustrate how it actually works using only one belt and wheel set. Picture how the gearing works on your typical multi-speed mountain bike; three gear rings in front, and anywhere from six to nine gears in the rear cluster. Using the smallest front gear and the largest rear gear gives the greatest power at the expense of speed. Using the largest front and the smallest rear yields the greatest speed at the expense of power, everything else is somewhere in the middle. With a CVT, the front and rear wheel sets are cut on a bias forming a ""V"" groove. Both the front and rear wheel sets can change their distance from each other, which forces the ""V"" belt to ride higher or lower in said grooves, thus changing the gear ratio.

I hope this helps.

Shipo

That stopped me for a few moments while I tried to visualize the wheel sets going from defined gears to something more akin to a gradient, so that changes in the distance between the wheel sets resulted in the belt sliding up or down the V groove. Well, I was able to see that dynamic eventually. It may not reflect the reality of what happens mechanically, but I think I got the idea, and can see how a smoother ""gear shift"" results.

4104,"March 12, 2004 3:05PM",johncalifornia,"One commentator on my criticism of CR's data gathering said: ""Your overall point that surveys aren't perfect is a fair one. However I disagree with your conclusion that &#147;the data is flawed and the results are worthless&#148;. Yes the responses are voluntary, but that doesn&#146;t totally invalidate them. When Gallup does a political poll or any other poll, the responses are also voluntary. And the results are, while not perfect, still generally in the ballpark.""

Please, there is a huge difference between valid Gallup surveying, where the polling organization initiates the response (this is NOT voluntary sampling), and CR/JDP type surveys, where the data source initiates the response. This last ""voluntary"" type of data gathering HAS NO RELEVANCE among statisticians, because the results will be skewed according to the biases of the respondents.

Check the Fox Web site for their daily ""instant survey"" questionnaire -- the one you can fill out on the spot and then see the ""results."" Fox take care to say at the bottom of the questionnaire that, ""This is not a scientific poll."" Why? Because it's ""voluntary"" sampling. The results have no statistical validity whatever.

Neither do CR's by the same scientific reasoning. There is no debate about this -- it's proven statistical science. But the fact that there IS no debate is telling: it's in the interest of the polling groups (CR, JDP) and the manufacturers to keep the truth benind these polls under the carpet.

Anyway, no serious car enthusiast takes CR seriously in any form or manner. (And yes, CR do more than describe reliability -- they tell people what to buy, and it's usually a Buick.)

Years ago Car & Driver magazine did a brilliant parody of CR. Now THAT is a car magazine worth reading. An opinion by one of C&D's editors carries more weight with me than a bushel of CR ""surveys"" or their fuddy-duddy recommendations of boring cars."
4105,"March 12, 2004 5:05PM",ljflx,But for every car enthusiast there are a 100 ordinary consumers who are car buyers and they feel the other way around.

Plus when every survey says the same thing and I see the same results through the experiences of those I know I conclude that those surveys are right on the money.

I agree, however, that people give them too much weight. Some of their rankings are not objective at all, and seem to rely on the whims of the testers.

In the display (plasmas, lcd, etc.) forums, their results are pretty much universally laughed at.

4110,"March 13, 2004 3:05PM",dwongswong,"I'm just a 31-year-old man who loves cars. After reading all these debates on Germans vs Japanese, reliability, and electronic complexity, I feel like these debates will go on until the end of time. Let's just agree that it will never be resolved, and let's talk about what we love about cars.

I work long hours everyday (6 days a week most of the time), and all I have to look forward to is time with my wife and our families, watching sports, being with friends, and driving our two cars. I drive a 2003 Audi A6, and my wife drives a 2000 BMW 3-coupe. Yes, we do like our German cars. The Audi is very comfortable, roomy, and pleasing to the eyes (both exterior and interior). The BMW is very fun to drive and looks great. Although we've enjoyed having them, they are not the most reliable cars that we've ever had. The Audi has been in the dealership once for rear window not coming up. The BMW has been in the dealership for several issues (VANOS intake system malfunction, molding came unglued twice, peeling of interior parts, and bad cd player). The Japanese cars that we've owned prior to the Germans never had any issue. This is not saying that Japanese cars will not have any problem and German cars will. It just means that this is what happened during our ownership. I've also owned two BMW's prior to the Audi and had many problems with both of them. Even though I had issues with the German cars, I still like them better than the Japanese cars as far as looks and the way they drive. But as far as reliability and cost of ownership, nothing is better than the Japanese.

My wife and I want to start a family in a couple of years, so most likely we will not be getting anymore German cars because of the possible extra cash flow that we will have to spend to keep them. We decided that whatever our next car we are going to get, it would have to be Japanese. I'm not saying that the Japanese car that we will get is going to be trouble free. I'm just going with the odds that it will be trouble free.

We just went to an auto show to see and sit in the beautiful cars. I still would rather get a German car, but I will have to get a Japanese car because we plan to keep it for a while. If I had $100,000, could spend it on any car to live with for the next 7 years, and pay for all maintenance and cost of ownership, it would have to be the Audi A8L. Simply, it was the most beautiful car there that can sit five, carry a lot in the trunk, had a strong engine, and turn heads. Unfortunately, I live in reality, so we will have to get a Lexus as our next car."

4112,"March 14, 2004 8:52PM",pablo_l,"Staregically, the move upmarket by VW is very understandable. Yesteryear's elite brands have becme today's mass brands. The BMW 3 series has long overtaken cars such as the Ford Taurus as best-sellers. Luxury has become a volume leader. That means that a brand like VW, which used to own the largest volumes with cars like the Golf and Polo in Europe, and was able to charge a premium due to the perception of durability and quality compared to Fiat and Renault etc faces a big strategic connundrum. Vision wise, they did the right move: they used their cash to buy themselves boutique brands... but there also major blunders: Audi was their natural brand ready to welcome aspiring luxury buyers, but the VW treasure coffins did very little for Audi, and the Audi strategy has remained too conservative - either because of more modest means, or because VW neglected to kick some butt within Audi management, demanding they take more market share away from the other big 2 German brands. Also, one must wonder why VW decided to actually compete aggressively against Audi. It'd be interesting to see a study of Phaeton buyers, and see what other car their top choice was - it would not surprise me if it would be the A8, in which case the Phaeton is entirely pointless for the VW Holding (as opposed to the VW brand). Te whole point about brand engineering is to compete with other companies - not to offer internal overlap.

In AutoBild, they wrote an article that talked about how the early Phaeton success was almost entirely at the cost of the outgoing A8 model, which basically suffered the stiffest decrease in sales at the time. It has recovered with the new model, ergo the Phaeton's weakness. Figures.

AutoBild also confirms the 7 series is officially regarded as a bust by BMW, and that very significant re-design (internally called ""De-Bangling"") will take place. The stuck on rear will be entirely gone, as will the angry eyebrows."

2005/2006 Mercedes-Benz S-Class: I am looking most forward to this new car. I certainly hope it will regain the rock-solid, tank-like construction of pre-DaimlerChrysler.

But what I am looking for is a Porsche 4-door luxury/sporty sedan that is based off the 2004 A8L and the Volkswagen Phaeton. Porsche already used the same design for the Cayenne/Touareg (I own a Cayenne S and personally it looks too similiar to the Touareg), and the ""2005"" A7 SUV will be based off the same shell.

This methodology is, statistically speaking, no different from Gallup's, and does NOT suffer from the type of possible self-selection bias that CR does.

That CR's sample is self-selecting does not statistically prove bias; it just means they COULD be biased. The fact that CR results are broadly inline with JDP's suggests to me that whatever biases might be present are less than you seem to think.

4117,"March 15, 2004 7:52AM",ljflx,"In the past JD Power got their new car sales data from RL Polk. RL Polk tracks every car sale in the US through every state's DMV. This is also how JD Power tracks used car sales and knows - via the Polk data - which cars are being held onto. Thus they can survey satisfaction at any time during a cars existence and know exactly where that car went. The surveys are weighted but not in the true demographical (financial data on buyer income) sense because personal data about the buyer is not collected other than name and address. No information company is ever interested in the buyer - per se - just the block of constituents the buyer profiles. Car Fax - which is the company that tracks how often a car is re-sold and has a consumer relationship (the others are all B-to-B models) is now owned by RL Polk but was initially a JV between then and someone else. As I said - I went down this whole path of an auto strategy for my former company but abandoned it because we changed directions strategically due to other opportunities that materialized. Certain members of this board simply refuse to believe it but the auto industry has great respect (and fear) for the CR data and reacts immediately to it. If you notice none have ever been able to successfully sue CR and the quality of the data is the reason. I think I've said enough about all this but I know this whole area inside out.

VW - a company that seems to be very confused at the moment and missed ordinary business matters such as currency hedging this past year. They were too lost on a lux strategy that only made sense if they didn't own Audi or intended to spin them off. Money wasted on the Phaeton would have been much better spent on improving car quality of both Audi and VW."
4118,"March 15, 2004 9:35AM",designman,"Perhaps you can answer this? I find it very curious how the BMW 5 series and Cayenne didn't get reviewed in CR. Both were out before the now-venerable Acura TL, especially the 2004 Cayenne which came out last year."

taint so per JDP year ending sales reports:

2003 Ford Taurus 300,496

2003 BMW 3-Series 111,944

The entire BMW units sales for the U.S. including MiniCooper was 270,000 for 2003, about 10% less than the Taurus alone (which fell over 9% in 2003 from 2002).

I don't think that the BMW 3-series has ever 'long overtaken' cars such as the Taurus.

Good point about the 'massification' of the BMW market. 270,000 cars of any one kind isn't very unique."
4120,"March 15, 2004 11:56AM",ljflx,"They didn't review the Acura TSX either. They extensively tested the TL in February but gave no data on satisfaction or depreciation because its so new. They scored it a notch under highest reliability though (every other Acura is as high as it can go). They will tend to predict reliability based on past models and how other models in the car line are doing. They probably underscored the Acura here. The 5 is yet to be tested and they simply did not predict its reliability. I'd be glad if I were BMW because the 7 scored very poorly, the X5 scored poorly and the 3 and the Z4 were average in reliability. The Cayenne has yet to be tested and CR does not publish data if it does not have sufficient sample so I'd guess the latter is the case."
4121,"March 15, 2004 2:05PM",prattster,"Yeah, the new TL being a top pick is interesting since it's been on sale since fall not much time to build a reliability picture but since almost every Acura and 90% Honda's are recommended or top picks CR is pretty confident. Nonetheless, it's flying off dealers lots even prior to this good buzz.

Real surprising is the '03 Toyota 4runner V6 being below average but the V8 much better than average. It being the only Toyota on the used cars to avoid list. The GX470 the only Lexus rated slightly below average. What issues were affecting the GX, small 1st year production issues? How the heck they list the LX470 as NA data it's been out since '98?"
4122,"March 15, 2004 4:57PM",ljflx,They've had the LX like that for years so I don't get it either. The TLC always scores the highest marks possible though. A lot of reported vibration problems with the GX that some have said they have are probably behind that average score. I asked my sales guy what was going on and he said they had no reported problems out of the norm but that Lexus was changing tires because enough complaints had come in. Lexus pretty much switched over to Dunlops and Michelins and away from Bridgestones on the GX as a result. Mine is perfect and I expect it will be that way for the 3 years. GX problems have been way toned down on the GX board so maybe they are gone or very minor now. I had also heard that Lexus was overwhelmed by demand for the GX and had to scramble to up production by 35%. By the way the SC430 also scored only average in its first production year.

If the 3 were to overtake a Taurus in volume then BMW would either need to increase sales by a factor of 2.5x to 700k cars a year or have the 3 series represent 65%+ of all US BMW's sold. I don't see either scenario happening anytime soon. The 3 is just not that popular and doesn't meet the family needs the way a family sedan does.

Merc1 - been kinda quiet. Maybe you're away . But anyway I finally caught up on the Maybach board. Seems MB hasn't made those cars as perfect as they represented they would. Maybe they just can't do it the way they used to anymore - even on a very low volume car."

Didn't you tell me a while back that CR is the single most important thing in the automotive world for consumers and that the autorags are worthless because they don't worship at the CR/JDP alter?

If that were the case why do a new edition.

As for them dissing Lexus. Read between the lines and you'll read a lot more. Read the test results and Lexus wins in some cases and they still vote it behind. I remember some memorable posts on this board. these guys - in some, not all cases have yet to accept Lexus. That is their problem not mine.

As for CR - I said it carries much more weight with the car buying public than the mags. That is because the enthusiast represents less than 10% of car buyers.

Me - I think the individual car write-ups are good in the mags. It's the comparos that are worthless and usually determined in advance by what the car was built to do. It's CR and JDP that tells you what the buyer experience is.

  Here we go again..The Lexus vs German war..I agree with ljflx on the CR front. The results of CR and JDP are far more publicized than those of Car and Driver. CD's bias is clear towards German cars from the start. Their criticism of the LS usually revolves around the ""Too much of an isolation chamber"" I've been reading this criticism for over 10 years..Obviously the buyers of Lexus aren't listening.
   We've all debated the nuances distinguishing these cars. What are consumers looking for at the end of the day? A High Quality product that features the cutting edge technology and good residual value. Criticise Lexus as you may, but they fit this criteria perfectly. If the mainstream consumer weighted the handling and other ""feel"" characteristics as C&D do, no one would buy a LS to begin with.
   As for this continuing argument over the Lexus being boring...I might have bought that with the LS400, but the LS430 is far more nimble. My LS430 has the Sports Suspension, and it's pretty good to me. I feel that the the differences between Lexus and other automakers are greatly exaggerated. If I were to believe what I hear on this board, the LS430 would be the Airliner equivalent to a 747 whilst a MB or BMW a F-16..I haven't driven an LS with the 18"" Sports Suspension package..How does it feel relative to the competition?

Yes Lexus wins some comparos now and then, but if you read between the lines, like on the latest comparo in C&D you'd see that they really didn't expect the car to win or even appeal to them, the car basically won on doing everything well, which is not a problem..that's what luxury cars are supposed to do. However they never ever said anything about the LS430 being the enthusiast's choice because it isn't.

You really don't incorporate anything from the car mags unless it agrees with CR and JDP.

4131,"March 16, 2004 10:37PM",merc1,"The analogy about the BMW and MB handling like an F16 is the same as the reliability issue on this board. Exactly the same. No matter how you view it, the BMW and Mercedes do handle better, the numbers prove it. Ditto for the LS430 being more reliable. If one trait is overblown and ridiculous the other is also, but they are true.

What defines the mainstream consumer for this end of the market? The S-Class, 7-Series and LS all sell pretty much sell the same somewhere between 20-25K, and the BMW rides and handles way different from the LS, with the S in the middle handling/ride wise, so obviously some of these mainstream consumers like the BMW's handling over the LS ride-is-everything disposition.

Let me guess JDP and CR has a survey with the breakout on who is and who isn't an enthusiast.

4132,"March 17, 2004 9:34AM",sv7887,"Merc,
  I have to disagree. I know how much you hate JDP, but they seem to be the only ones who provide ""accepted"" stats on this subject. For 2002 Lexus cars had something like 178 defects per 100 vehicles. Jaguar was third with something like 250 and I know MB, BMW are signficantly higher..
  That's almost a 50% differential. I'd say that is very significant. It means the competitors to the LS have 50% more problems and as a result cost more to maintain. I believe this JDP survey measured problems within the first few months of ownership. You can't deny that a consumer would be detered from purchasing a car that has 50%+ more issues than a Lexus car. Time is money.

In comparing this to the handling argument I presented, Lack of handling doesn't cost $$$..It's more of a perception thing and is highly subjective. However, Reliablity is a tangible thing that can be easily measured. I think consumers do weight relability more heavily than handling characteristic for the reasons I've stated. That's probably why these CR and JDP studies are publicized more.

I don't think reliability is overblown. I'd venture to say it was the most important factor in my purchasing a Lexus and not another MB. People do vote with their wallets..Back in 1986 I owned a Jaguar XJ6. It was a lovely car when it wasn't in the shop. While more of a purist car, it wasn't worth the hassle. Sure, I'm trading off some handling when I buy a Lexus, but I'm buying piece of mind.

Of course, some ""purists"" on this board own several different cars and are more willing to tolerate minor quirks. But I don't think the mainstream overworked American consumer has the time to deal with the newfound issues these German cars are having. Sooner than later, this issue is going cost the Germans in the sales dept.

This is exactly what separates the enthusiasts from the JDP/CR crowd, because I personally can tell the difference between a LS and a 7-Series or a S-Class. Secondly seeing as how this board loves to use numbers, the handling numbers don't lie. The German cars handle better, whether you can tell or not is based on your driving style.

I won't argue that consumers place more emphasis overall on reliability, but to say that less than 10 percent of consumer care about handling is pure absurdity. If that was the case the LS430 would outsell a car like the 7-Series by more than 5K units a year.

I don't think reliability itself is overblown, but the reliability argument on this board is past overblown. Reading this board in particular you would think not a single MB, BMW, Audi or Jaguar is capable of providing a decently reliable luxury car experience.

There are all kinds of enthusiasts who buy anything. I'm an electronic enthusiast but don't ever ask me to build an electronic item for you or explain all the ins and outs. Merc1 is what I would call a hard core enthusiast and when I reference a 10% figure that is what I mean - the pure hardcore auto enthusiasts. Now I love handling but I prefer a great ride first. If I can get the LS430 sport I get the best of both. Why my preference to ride and reliability - I get to enjoy 100% of both all the time and I get to enjoy 100% of the great handling - well maybe 1 or 2 % of the time. Easy logical decision for me - give me better than normal handling with the best ride in the world. The LS (and the S for that matter at least from a ride standpoint) solve my needs and desire perfectly particularly because I'm buying a family sedan not a sports car. Secondly I'll take the super reliability over the fickle super handling cars - which tend to have complex problems - any day. The handling will end up being excess whereas the reliability can never be excess.

Now if I follow merc's logic then anyone who buys a Lexus couldn't possibly be an enthusiast because of what the mags say. If they were they wouldn't ever buy a Lexus - afterall - it's been deemed by the mags as a non-enthusiast's car.

Most of you should know by now:

The die-hard Lexus LS430 fan will probably stick to supporting the Lexus, no matter what the MB says, and vice versa.

I was a different case, though. After a happy ""marriage"" with my trusty Lexus LS400, I finally decided Lexus was too borring, and was considering the BMW 745Li and the Mercedes S430. I went ahead with the Mercedes- big mistake.

Granted, Mercedes has a BIG problem with reliability. But the sheer fun of driving behind the wheel of a Mercedes, and seeing that silver star makes up for the number of times I have had to bring in the S-Class for service, ranging from airmatic to power trunk.

What was one of the main reasons why i did not decide to return to Lexus, after more than a decade of pleasant driving experience? Their philosophy. Believe it or not, I finally grew tired of their (Lexus & Toyota) ""How about I copy you?"" philosophy towards their competition (basically the Germans). Just take a look at the LS430 (part. the '00-'03 model); it's almost identical in exterior to the previous generation S-Class. The next-generation GS greatly resembles the new ""Banglerized"" BMW's, particularily the new 5er and 6er. Another one is the Toyota Camry; the rear is quite similar to the E-Class. Maybe it's just my personal opinion, but I finally had enough (w/ exception of the SC430).

I'm also tired of hearing people bashing BMW and Bangle for their design-trend. It might be unusual and too-futuristic/controversial, but it's ""revolutionary and evolutionary"" in terms of design and technology, not to mention performance. Many characteristics (albeit the trunk, which in my opinion, was marvellous and gorgeous, but backfired in the minds of many) such as iDrive have made it into the competition. It might be a little ""rusty"", but they pioneered it, and often, the one who invents/creates new ideas controversial at first become second-nature later on down the road.

Below is a list I just came up with:

Audi A8L 4.2 Quattro- +Sport/+luxury/+design
BMW 745Li- ++Sport/++avant-garde/++design
Lexus LS430- +++ Luxury
Mercedes S430/S500- +/-Sport/++luxury
Infiniti Q45- +sporty/+luxury

This is true of any luxury car buyer, but it *seems* like you're trying to say that the German cars in the segment don't provide these things. Who buys a car in this class and doesn't place at the very least some emphasis on these things? Are S-Classes, 7-Series' and A8s really that noisy and non-luxurious? Safety? The German cars wrote the book on this issue, especially the S-Class and A8.

ljflx,

I'm sorry, but anyone that only owns Lexuses and raves about surveys, plush riding and sound systems is not an enthusiast in my book. If all the former Mercedes owners are doing the same things now then they aren't either. However it is not all about what a person owns either, its a mind state or way of thinking. You yourself drive any and everything else on the market (Cayenne, a sporty SUV no less) and expect it be quiet and dulling like a LS430. If I drive or ride in a Hummer H2 I'm not looking at the leather. Ultimately it is about choice and its really no big deal, but please don't tell me that buying a Lexus LS430 is in any way, shape or form even close to being an enthusiast. It is the dullest car in the segment. When you get that SL500 or 330Ci then......

If former Mercedes owners now prefer Lexus I'm sure they have their reasons, but at least they've been there unlike most of the survey clutchers on this board.

He's a great guy and all but he is no enthusiast from what I've seen on these boards, and he certainly doesn't see cars anywhere near the same as I do. You must not have been paying attention for at least the last 3 years. What in the world is passionate about a LS430? My statement was not meant to single him out personally, just to point out the general stick-in-the-mud mood on this board. Did you not see where I said it isn't *always* about what someone owns? It's just as much of a viewpoint or way of seeing cars too. Missed that part?

Like I said before, it's no big deal really, but please don't try to lump me in with the survey watching crowd and then try to blanket everyone as enthusiasts. That's ridiculous. I take myself too seriously? Ok. I'm reminded of a time where a Lexus owner that used to post here basically stated that another poster was an idiot for buying a piece of junk E-Class instead of an LS430. Now that is serious.

What in the world does a discontinued Supra have to do with this discussion? Ditto for a 20K MR2? These cars have nothing to do with Lexus, and all Mr. Clements has done so far is promise. Hardly proof of anything yet.

Would you care to compare Toyota's racing history to Mercedes-Benz's? Hint: Toyota isn't even close. Mercedes was involved in the first races of the automobile and had established their racing rep before there was even a Toyota to speak of.

4148,"March 19, 2004 3:27AM",aggie76,"It seems that several folks think that the only definition of enthusiast is that it only refers to someone whose automotive interest in the realm of sports cars with handling and acceleration only.

Reading the latest Merriam-Webster definition says that ""enthusiast"" refers to ""someone who is filled with enthusiam as a : one who is ardently attached to a cause, object, or pursuit b : one who tends to become ardently absorbed in an interest."" While the example is sports car - it definitely means intersts can be much broader.

This seems to indicate that we can all be enthusiasts of the automotive world with different interests. I enjoy all the different vehicles for different reasons but most importantly I am an Auto Enthusiast who has admiration for all the manufacturers out there and their abilities to differentiate motors, wheel, and shells to carry people and things.

I value reliability, quality, handling, performance and style and have weighted these differently from my early youth to my mature perspective these days. Today's U.S. public roads leave us less and less opportunity to explore the handling and performance limits of automotive technology. I reserve that enjoyment to the SCCA, WRC, Formula One and other venues now as a participant or observer.

I do however value my time and no longer enjoy visiting my local mechanic or dealership like I did years ago to chat about cars while mine was in for repair or maintenance. I would rather spend time in my business and with my family now that I have achieved my goals and professional success. The desire for reliability and quality is now a much greater priority in my life.

My colleague's 2003 C230 Kompressor/6-speed was a blast to drive. Did I tell you already ? As an LS owner, that was a different kinda ride for me. Taut steering, crisp and precise gear shifts, handles curves like a champ. I thought I was driving a 5-er. A little annoying problem with the electrical didn't do much to dampen my enthusiasm (that word again) for this car. MB makes darn good cars, just sad to see it messed up with little stuff like electrical circuitry....

Would I do the LS again ? Let me just say that I cannot wait for MY 2007. I will pay CASH for a 2007 LS4/5xx. I have been saving for it (thanks to home valuation here in San Diego hitting the roof), and although I have the cash right now, I won't sweat the 2004 model.

Just curious why the general disdain for the X-type. I don't own one, but I've spent a little time in one. I just don't get the hatred of it. Really size, luxury and peformance wise it is very similar to the old Mk I and Mk II Jag sedans of the 50's and 60's. Good decendent if you ask me except for the AWD part. I would prefer the more traditional RWD. I actually don't mind the platform sharing (just something that we're going to have to accept in today's market) but the car seems well composed and for those that knock the interior, it seemed much nicer that the c-class and 3-series that it competes against.

The only big thing I can think of is that people have come to think of Jaguar as only being the XJ8 and anything other than that they reflexively don't like as a ""cheap"" Jaguar.

I've driven and rode in the S-class many times. Heck - I was even chaffeurred home in one on a return trip from JFK. Best limo I've ever been in. It's a wonderful car. My experience is simple - rides great - a tad less graceful than an LS430, handles very well - a tad bit better than an LS430 - though it probably does handle noticably better than the old LS400. You mis-understand my point about the LS 430 Euro-sport. It was made to be a better handler than the base S-class. It was not made to be a sport-edition car the way the MB sport was. The latter gives up too much of its great ride - from everything I've read - I have no experience here. But the LS430 sport retains nearly all of its great ride and outhandles the base S-class car. For that - you hardly have to pay extra. But 80% of LS430 buyers prefer the non-sport suspension car as do I'm sure 80% or more of the S-classs buyers. That speaks volumes about this segment and says very clearly that the enthusiasm here is for luxury not sport.

BMW 7 - It sold a record level 20K cars last year but historically its best year previously was around 18k cars. It usually sells in the 14-15k range and I'll bet most of its buyers do not take advantage of its sporty heritage. I wouldn't say that about the 5 series though.

Maybach - it was obvious to me that sales were slow when I saw as many as 4 in inventory in the local sunday paper at Ray Catena. That's a lot of cars for just one dealership given the very low production element of this car. As well that was only a partial listing of available cars so there may have been even more on hand. MB will be making a mistake if they launch a mid $100K figure Maybach car. That is too close in price to the higher end MB's and will make people wonder where does one brand end and another begin. The big mistake they made seems to be that they made the car far too close to an S600 in the first place. It doesn't have enough of a new brand image to justify a $200k price premium. On the other hand the Rolls has no visual resemblance to any BMW car and is very unique. I guess that's the advantage of buying the brand rather than creating it."

It was interesting to read about how the approval process of automobile design works and is balanced between interior and exterior design teams. The latter group in conjunction with the engineers still wields the power but some of the power is shifting to the interior design team for the first time.

4165,"March 22, 2004 7:00PM",ljflx,"Now that I'm about to order the 2004 LS430 I looked back at how well the cars I looked at in 2001 have done as per Edmunds used car reports. The 5 cars I looked extensively at were the 2001 E430 4-matic (judged too small but desired initially because of the AWD), the Audi A8L (always loved its looks and AWD but overall found it disappointing), the S430 and S500 and the LS430. The S-class cars, particularly the S500 and the LS430 were far superior to both of the other cars for my tastes and preferences.

The prices and residuals were - E430 $61.5k with a residual of $39k. Today the dealer retail is $37k and the consumers rated the car at 8.2. The A8L was $72.4k and had a residual of $39k. Today the dealer retail is a bit under $38k and consumer rating is 7.9. The S430 was $76.1 and had a residual of $49k. Today the dealer retail is $46k and the consumer rating is 8.3. The S500 was $85.3k and had a residual of $55k. Today the dealer retail is $52k and the consumer rating is the same 8.3. Finally the LS430 was $61.5k and had a residual of $37.5k. Today the dealer retail is $42k and the consumer rating is a sky high 96 (pretty clear this group of buyesr are real happy). Since the residuals were my buyouts I would have expected all the cars to have dealer retail above those figures but only the LS430 can make that claim - by a fairly wide margin.

I have no doubt I made the best choice then and will go for another ride. But some of these guys have really been burned on the residuals and the strength of the dollar worsens it even more."

The fact that Lexus designed the sport version of the LS to out handle the base S-Class is their problem not Mercedes'. What kind of excuse is that? Secondly, I have not seen one single report in which an S-Class with the sport option gave up too much ride comfort, nor have I experienced it myself, having actually driven a 2002 S500 Sport more than a few times.

I never said anyone buying an S-Class was buying it for sport, my point is that the option is there and it's a real sport option, unlike the LS, which is merely a tire upgrade. The S Sport package transforms the car in looks and capability. Guess what the S-Class now offers just the option of upgraded wheels and tires too (without the body work). My point is that with an S-Class Sport you'll pay more and you'll get more than the LS' so-called ""sport"" option.

You should read up on the 7-Series board, they talk about driving far more than anyone on this board. The sportiness of the 7-Series is indeed a selling point, and if we're guessing you know I'd guess that more 7 owners use it than S or LS buyers.

You're right about Maybach. I've said all along the car was too close to Mercedes inside and out. It is too much like a super S600 than an entirely different i.e. special car. Both Maybach and Rolls fell short in 2003. I said from the beginning that neither of them would be able to sell 1000 cars a year in the U.S. There are just too many high-end cars competing for the most elusive of buyers in the 200k+ market. The dealer here has had one on the floor for a few months now too. Still they did move over 160 of them last year, at 300K+ a pop, and that was from June, not a full year.

Technically Mercedes didn't ""create"" Maybach, they revived it. Wilhelm Maybach was instrumental in the very first ""Mercedes"" cars and the brand the carried his name made some of the best cars on earth long ago. I know, I know it doesn't matter in today's market and isn't memorable to anyone under 80 years old..lol.

I'm not the one you need to mention this to.

Secondly, the ABC provides more than minor handling improvements. Look at the handling numbers for the S-Class in the last Car and Driver comparo with ABC+Sport pk compared to the previous S-Classes they tested without either, hardly minor differences I agree it is an expensive option but it is there.

You mention ABC+sport package. the standard sport package does not include ABC. Is ABC not another couple of thousand $$$ option on top of the regular sport package? And as I remember the regular sport package for $5K+ offers slight improvements in handling, basically due to the tire size and compound difference.

In my last post I was referring to the slight improvements in handling with just the sport package, not including ABC. I get C&D and read the review. The S500 is a great car with or without sport and ABC."

The SC came out a few months after the LS in 2001. The timing fits for a concept right about now. I also think that the LFS style will really be reflected deeply in the 2007 LS. Lexus knows that the LS400 is the car that made its name in 1990 and the new brand image and styling will be led by the LS again. I also think the HPX will debut at the same time as the next gen LS. In fact maybe they will blitz the market with a new LS, SC and HPX at the same time. Makes sense if they are going to a more consolidated styling theme. I know this - I'm looking foward to the 2004 LS - which I will take in a few weeks - and am real anxious to see that 2007 LS.

In the past, I would trade without hesitation. There are so many excellent choices. I feel a little shallow agonizing over this."
4202,"March 26, 2004 12:21PM",markcincinnati,". . .let me see if I am following along correctly.

1. New STS ushers out the old Seville, period. STS will be the ""only"" offering (at this time) no ""detuned"" less sporty version like the old SLS?

2. New '05 Audi interior reminds ""us"" of a Chevy interior and current Audi interiors are boring?

Note: OK, I guess I see some similarities in the picures presented above -- what does the STS interior look like -- for comparison?

Note2: Boring is a subjective term, the editors of such Car Guy (male or female ""guy"") publications as Car and Driver, Automobile and Road and Track seem to use the Audi interiors as ""the standard that they hold others up to for comparison"" -- often resorting to ""this is an almost Audi-like interior, it is so good"" or ""the Audi interiors are ""jewel like"" with industry leading fit and finish.

Note3: Please observe this says nothing for or against Cadillac especially the new STS. The write ups about the new BMW interiors are pretty much all over the board, some like them, some don't, some editors calling them ""stark.""

3. The new Cadillac will be ""better"" than the German cars? In what way?

Am I correct that the new STS will indeed have a 116"" wheelbase? Wouldn't that contribute to a ""less dynamic"" chassis? Wouldn't that contribute to a more comfortable, smooth, touring car, but, less to some of the dynamics that Audi and BMW (at least) are often praised for having?

The fact that the brand new Audi dealer is next to one of the ""best"" Cadillac dealers in Cincinnati, will compel me to look at the STS, especially if it is priced between $45 and $55K (which is where I assume the new Audi A6 will come to).

I would only consider the STS with Magnaride and AWD and if a ""sport package"" is on the check sheet, I guess I would also be compelled to test the Caddy and the Audi back to back with similar sporting intentions.

Perhaps this is unfair, as it seems like the new STS should be put up against the Phaeton V8 or the Audi A8L (or perhaps even the A8) -- then the Cadillac will most certainly win the MSRP race, to say nothing of a GMAC incentive here and there.

Since there seems to be some real passion (pro) for the Cadillac here on this forum, I am keen to find out more. And, since the Audi and the Caddy are, as yet, not on sale, the debate will be, by necessity, based on the pre-release info and preview tests (if any).

In theory a larger wheelbase will make turn-in less crisp, but this isn't a narrow focused automobile. BMW favors sporting intentions over passenger comfort.

It just seems that the STS, past tense, I grant you, was much larger than the 5 series BMW or the A6.

What would appear to be the case, is that the STS would attract buyers looking for either larger cars or within the price range (BTW what is the price range of the new STS) of the new STS.

I have a current model allroad (an A6 by another name) and I can't seem to find its wheelbase, but I assume it is less than 116.4"".

My point has nothing to do with challenging the ""quality"" assumption -- for I cannot presume to know what the quality of either the 2005 STS or 2005 A6 will be.

I am rooting for Cadillac, don't get me wrong -- but I have been a long time Audi driver and have test driven multiple STS's (obviously NOT the new one), and they were very nice and the Northstar engine was potent -- but the sporting capabilities of these current gen STS cars was, er, ""muted"" (especially when compared with the Germans).

So I opted for the custom lux in flint mica with the black nappa leather. The antique walnut wood is gorgeous and the sample picture in the LS book can't hold a candle to how great it looks in the car. As edspider says the interior is where you live and the nappa leather and that wood make for a stunning home. The 2004 LS really does have an extraordinary ride. Best ever and the six speed makes you feel the acceleration difference to the 2001. I take it home in three weeks. Three year lease at more than $125 per month cheaper than my 2001 LS even though the sticker is $3800 more. Interest rates are half of what they were in 2001.

If the new A6 interior has flaws (and it does), and resembles a GM truck then what would you call that same interior design in a 60K Caddy truck? Also, the Chevy/Slade interior is about 10 years behind a VW or Audi in quality of materials, even if their design is similar (not that I agree with that they are).

4213,"March 27, 2004 8:31AM",ljflx,"It's definitely 2007 but no release date is set. The execs at my dealership think it will be spring 2006 based on their meetings and correspondence with Lexus. Remember also that they are one of the biggest dealerships in the US so they have clout with Lexus. I doubt that most dealerships will share data so easily. My dealer - Ray Catena - will tend to share with long time customers because he also sells MB, Jags etc, so their primary interest is 1 - keep you with Lexus, 2 - keep you with Ray so that if you go MB, Jag ... you'll go with him and not someone else. It's their belief that Lexus doesn't want the S-class to have much of a lead on them in bringing the new edition to market. It's also their belief that the new LS will generate a lot of excitement because of the new hybrid technology it will bring to the market. I've heard largely what lenscap posted through them so there is something strong behind it. But I was told mpg will be in the 35 range and the HP will be north of 400. I don't know if they are coming out with a V12 and I don't care. The hybrid will cause a profound change in this segment.

The 2004 is fabulous. The ride is phenomenal and the road feel is tighter than before. The custom lux and ultra lux are even quieter than the other LS editions because of the glass. Hope it doesn't interfere with EZPass. My ex-boss has a problem with his A8 because the windshield glass prevents the readers from picking up EZpass. If you can swing it I'd lease it for 3 years. The 2007 LS will be much hotter than the 2001 was - IMO - so it will be a MSRP or above priced car for a prolonged period. By spring and summer of 2007 the prices will subside. A three year lease starting in April or May positions you well. Lease prices are great right now because LS residuals are higher than just about any car in this segment and interest rates are low. I'm actually paying $138 a month less than 2001 for a lot more car."

Need to go to a Maybach to beat this interior as far as I'm concerned.

Anyway for 2004, I got the black with antique walnut. I know I'll like it better than the black I have now. I'm hoping it will look richer and warmer. I stuck with the ultra because that's what I had before. I was afraid to find out what loosing the air suspension would do to the ride. (probably nothing).

4219,"March 27, 2004 10:29PM",oac,"For your suggestions on moving up to the 2004.

Here is my problem.

When the 2004 LS came out, I went to take a long hard look at the first one to arrive at my dealer showroom floor. I was impressed visually, but felt the changes were too subtle, especially compared to the LF-S concept. So I decided to take a pass and wait for the complete re-design in MY 2007. Reading, seeing and hearing all the great things about the 2004 (esp the 6-speed) made me go back to take another look. Yes, I still like it, but just not that much to pull the trigger right now. Maybe my hesitation has to do with the fact that I like my 2nd gen exterior design more than the 3rd gen '01 - '04. And hence would much prefer the redesign especially if it has close resemblance to the LF-S concept. That would really give me a lot of joy to own such a car.

So I am prepared to wait a couple of years. My current '99 has given me nothing but pleasant ownership experience. No complaints whatsoever. Now with 80K miles, it continues to perform flawlessly, making the choice of buying a new one right now that much more difficult. But I am happy to note that my dealer was not sand-bagging me with his lack of info on release date."

The interior of the A6 looks horrible, the interior of the 5 series is better, but still stark and business like. As far as I'm concerned Lexus has been doing the best interiors for years and cadillac seems to be headed more int he lexus direction, while the Germans are doing God knows what. The STS interior is a definite improvement over the CTS and we all know the interior was the biggest source of criticism for the CTS. Assuming the CTS' interior upgrade in '05 makes it looks like the STS the CTS could definitely become one of the class leaders."

I didn't haggle the price to the bone so its possible you can do better. But every LS due in through the third week of April at Ray Catena is already sold and there are only 5 or 6 on the lot - which they tell me are sold also. Chase is $941 per month and Lexus Finance is $988. Leases are $0 down (I never put money down), $0 security and residuals are 60-61% for Chase and 58% for LFS. Chase gets a $300 turn-in fee but also gives you a $1500 damage waiver. I'm doing 15k miles. Take about $25-30 off if you do 12k miles. My last lease was 12k miles. Per edmunds most LS cars in our area are discounted about $2k so I'm satisfied. I'm funny - in business I fight much harder on price issues than I do in my personal life but I learned a long time ago that any business deal that's not a win-win - or doesn't connote a win-win feeling - is a failure.

By the way a neighbor who took a euro-sport LS in October paid full sticker as did two other town friends I know who bought in December. Lastly if you go to Ray's motor car web-site (not his Lexus site but his overall site) don't pay attention to the new car availability list.

Business Week Online has an article all about Lexus. In it they mention ""Project Mount Everest,"" a supercoupe that Lexus claims will hold its own against the $141,800 Aston Martin DB7 Vantage and $113,250 Mercedes SL55 AMG. The car is said to have a V10 engine and Lexus says it may be introduced as soon as the Tokyo Motor Show this fall. If that's true then it would make sense to have a concept version out at this time. Oh, by the way, the expected price is $150,000."
4230,"March 29, 2004 3:24PM",ljflx,That car was posted in a sketch a while back - maybe 6 months ago. I think it was coded as the v10 back then and a $150k price was noted.

4231,"March 29, 2004 4:46PM",footie,"If any of you are interested in learning more of how Toyota came to be, how they approach problems and opportunities and the real story behind the company and development of the Lexus brand, see if you can find this book at your local library like I did:

Against All Odds - The Story of the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Family that Created It. by Togo and Wartman (1993)

The trials and tribulations section of how the company started and barely survived WWII that makes up most of the book is bracketed by an introduction to the terror they went through deciding to risk doing Lexus and the final chapter where they reaped their rewards.

The last chapter talks about their market research that helped them define the Lexus cars. It also energized their committment to create an incredible customer service organization that they also made very low-key.

It might help clear away alot of the cobwebs and speculation that develops here about Toyota's intentions and Lexus' genesis."
4232,"March 30, 2004 1:52AM",merc1,"You asked about the next S-Class a few months back. There is some information leaking out. If you didn't know Mercedes will be discontinuing all of their SOHC, 3 valve-per-cylinder engines over the next 2 years. The new engines (V6s and V8s) will all be 24-32 valves and DOHC in design, with direct injection among other tricks.

This fall the new SLK 350 will be the first model to debut with the next generation engine, a 268hp V6. This engine of course will make its way over to the E320 giving us the E350, next C-Class, ML and it will be present in the SL350 (Europe only) and the CLS350 (next Feb). It will also power the upcoming GST (rumored R-Class).

CAR and Autoweek are both reporting that as per usual practice there will be two new V8s. One is a 4.6L with 355hp and the other is a 5.5L with 405hp. These will no doubt power the next generation S-Class (S450 I'm guessing because S460 doesn't sound quite right) and S550. Of course the SL500 will become the SL550 and the next base CL will be the CL550. You can knock off about 4 hp on each for U.S. figures. With the right pricing there could be 6-cylinder S-Class in the U.S. again.

The next generation AMG V8 cars will get a high-revving 6.3L V8 with over 500hp. Autoweek is reporting that Mercedes has already registered the name CLS63 among others. The two V12s stay the same for now.

The bad news is that it is also being reported that Mercedes is going forward with an idrive like system for the next S and CL, only. The British press says that they don't intend to implement this system on the lower level cars.

Also, the new CLS that just debuted at Geneva in production form that would normally come here this fall won't be released here until Feb 2005, to ensure launch quality is right for the U.S. market. The new SLK's interior looks to be of much higher quality than the previous car, even Edmunds said so, a big deal as they're one of the biggest complainers about some Mercedes' recent model's decline in interior quality. Hopefully this new emphasis on interior quality and reliability will be carried over to the next S-Class because the engine lineup looks like it will be class leading. It seems that someone in Germany is finally seeing that there is a problem and actually doing something about it.

4233,"March 30, 2004 8:29AM",ljflx,I'm curious as to whether people find scratches on their lux cars in places that make it obvious the scratches were not accidental and had to be done intentionally. Several of us were out to dinner the other night and its seems we all have found these things. One guy with an S-classs had a scratch that zig-aagged on his roof for its entire length. I don't need to say what he would do if he found the culprit particularly because he bought the car rather than leased it. I've found a few on my trunk but they were not all that bad and could be buffed out. But on my 1998 LS I had a few on my roof also.

This is my only gift to myself in 40 years, and I bought the car, so it pains me to see things like this. I think that is the intention by people who do things like this."

And if you see Japanese roads, you see why the cars handle differently than Autobahn stormers - lots of very slow speed extremely low radius turns, lots of wheel turning that needs a lot of assistance in a heavier car. What's odd is how ""right"" cars feel in their native environment: I got carted around in an older LS400, and it was great, a 3 hour drive passed by quickly.

4241,"April 1, 2004 4:18AM",saugatak,"Because it's a mercedes or because it's a good engine? Unfortunately/fotunately trade journals/panels often reserve a spot for past winners (like the last gold medalist automaticly get a spot in the finals)

Wards engine awards are trumpeted by ever automaker that gets 'em and you're some guy on the net.

Whose opinion has more credibility?

That must be why the the 3.2 liter MB consumes more fule than the 3.3 liter Toyota and not meeting ULEV standards whereas the Toyota does.

Um, OK, I wonder if gearing, aerodynamics or weight might have an effect on fuel efficiency IN ADDITION to the engine?

Was Toyota's 3.0L v6 ULEV compliant when it was introduced? I don't know. I thought the 3.3L v6 from Toyota was updated last year. You'd expect some improvement in an updated engine.

That must be why MB is finally replacing the 3-valv/2-spark engines with 4-valve engines in the upcoming lineup.

I think the more likely reason is that unwarranted criticism from buyers who insist on DOHC and 4 valves in the luxury market.

You do realize DOHC engines come with tradeoffs, don't you? The extra cams take up more space and limit displacement, which is what's needed to provide low end torque and up max. torque.

Mercedes is able to offer a 5.0L SOHC v8 which has more torque and power than their competitors', all of whom are offering 4.3 to 4.6L DOHC v8s.

I'm not criticizing DOHCs with continuous VVT on intake and exhaust. I'm just saying there are other ways to get things done. And technology ain't gonna move forward if companies aren't allowed to explore alternative solutions b/c of market demand for DOHC.

Being 90 degree unit is a cost-saving meassure because the block is a chop-off of a V8. In other words, it's hardly a point worth bragging.

It's both cost-saving and a bragging point. I have never driven a 90 degree v6 as smooth as MB's. I would never be able to tell that it's not a 60 degree v6. That's impressive, b/c it's usually not too difficult to tell when you're driving a 90 degree v6.

Honda uses the SOHC on family sedans for the low-cost markets like the Accord V6 for North America (the Euro Accord is sold here as Acura TSX, costing more than the North America V6 Accord even having only a DOHC I4). Honda puts a DOHC V6 in the NSX. That goes to show you where SOHC engines belong nowadays (cost savings); it's a damn shame that MB still puts those (and have one less valve than even the Accord V6) in a car that costs twice as much as an Accord V6 (E series, where the most frequent useage of 3.2 V6 is found)

I guess I'm less concerned with cost savings and more concerned with performance than you are.

If the SOHC v6 performs just as well as a DOHC v6, why do you care that the manufacturer is saving $? Is it your goal to extract every ounce of value out of the manufacturer?

Besides, the SOHC v6s are in Honda's luxury line. Acura TL and MDX are going to have SOHC v6s. No one yet knows what engine the RL will have other than that it's a 3.5L v6, but it will probably be a SOHC v6 as well.

Did they win on name brand, or low-cost? The MB 90degree 3-valve twin-spark V6 certainly is not a smooth running engine, compared to either the Toyota VVTi V6's or even the Honda SOHC V6's, and make significantly less power than either Japanese competition. No wonder MB is finally moving to 4-valve designs in the near future.

Hmmm . . . if all this is true, how come MB's 90 degree v6 is on Ward's 10 Best and Toyota's 3.3L v6 isn't? I'm not knocking Toyota here, their old 3.0L v6 was also one of Ward's 10 Best but I've never found the MB to be a thrashy engine.

As for NVH, every Lexus typically has better NVH than the comparable MB. It's something that Toyota focuses on, I don't know that it's due to the engines.

As for its power, the MB v6 was powerful when it was introduced. I'm sure MB could update the technology to produce more power, but they've chosen to go with the standard DOHC game. It's clear that's what the luxury markets demand, and MB has to comply."
4242,"April 1, 2004 6:08AM",footie,"The LS was designed for the U.S. market.

4243,"April 1, 2004 7:40AM",ljflx,"There are large volume sales of Lexus equivalent cars in all of Asia. They just don't count as Lexus because they are sold under the Toyota name plate. That's why the volume of actual Lexus + Toyotas version of Lexus cars are a lot closer in overall worldwide sales volume to MB and BMW than people think.

Footie - The original LS400 design - as I remember - was bred to be a US car but I am sure Toyota had the Japanese and Asian markets in their radar scopes. They didn't count on Europe since they weren't going to build the cars there and knew that would take a long time to penetrate. Anyone who goes to Europe often enough knows that you need to build your products in Europe to win over the market unless you are a monopoly. That's why its funny to read all the dissing comments on the board about Lexus from European car lovers. If Lexus was invented from an enthusiast standpoint it would have been out of business in 2 years or less. Business usually rules over emotion. There are exceptions though - witness VW these days."

1. The V8 is meant to signify the new IS will be even more sporting than the current IS and is an acknowledgement of America's love of cubic inches.
2. As a coupe it helps reposition the IS as a sportier car (although there will be a sedan).

The article also says the current IS buyer's average age is 30, the youngest for any Toyota/Lexus. Also, Toyota is dramatically rethinking the next IS because of its poor sales."
4246,"April 1, 2004 6:36PM",oac,"A few questions for you:

All reports to date speculate that there was going to be 3 variants of the next gen IS - coupe, sedan and conv. Does the Forbes article confirm this ? Does the article say anything about a hybrid engine (V6 or V8) for the IS ? How many trims/engines will the next IS have ? And will it have the I6 or a new V6 (like in the 2006 GS300 ?

Pablo: I do travel to Japan a lot and can confirm some of your cursory observations. Last December on a business trip to Tokyo, I was toted around in my company VP's black/black 2002 S500. That drive was the most pleasant and soothing I had ever had in 5+ years of trips to Japan. It was superb. Loved it. Graceful, smooth, comfortable and rode like walking on air (must have the air suspension). I had only rode in a Celsior while in Japan, an older model (2nd gen), which also drove quite well, but I must admit, the MB rode better. Granted it was an older Celsior (LS in the US/Europe and Australia). I'll be going back to Korea and Japan in June and hope to do more car-toting around (altho' right hand steering is downright dangerous if you are not used to it)"

It's easy to see the 2 holes in the line-up - the GS and IS. Also they've got to do something about the fact that the LX competes with its sibling Landcruiser. But if you combine the LX and TLC you have pretty good volume in that space too. Never met anyone yet who doesn't speak glowingly of the RX330. Did Lexus ever hit the sweet spot with that car/suv. Most people I know think of it as a tall station wagon and don't even consider anything else when their lease is up.

It will be interesting to see what happens. By this time next year we should know more.

4255,"April 2, 2004 10:46AM",syswei,"I don't know what Lexus is going to do with pricing. If they have 4 variants of the LS, 430, 430h, 500, 500h, then the 500h could well sell at a pretty steep premium (even though manufacturing cost difference wouldn't be dramatically higher). But if its only 500 and 500h, then it might be more reasonable. Personally a 430h would be fine for me.

Rx400h pricing hasn't been announced. I think I've read that hybrid adds about 4k of cost to a Prius, but this is bound to fall over time, and Toyota priced aggressively to encourage adoption."

I picked up the 2004 today - It's absolutely fabulous.

Edspider1 - you are gonna love it. Ride is great, handling is improved (this is very far removed from an old body 2000 LS400), there's more road feel but its quieter than 2001 and the new rims give the car an athletic look. The improvements are subtle to the non-owner but you'll notice and appreciate them alot. By the way I love the radar cruise and the swivel headlights.

4258,"April 2, 2004 7:51PM",johncalifornia,"When I bought my '98 XJ8 a few months ago it had a few door dings and I elected to leave them in place, knowing that if they were repaired I'd start obsessing about it getting ""pinstriped"" by the local misunderstood youth.

But . . . at my local car wash the manager made me an offer I couldn't refuse and within a couple of hours I had a near-showroom car. No more dings.

That was a couple of weeks ago, and so far so good. But I realize it's only a matter of time.

My underground parking at home is secure, and so is parking at work. I rarely park on the street and don&#146;t go to bars late at night -- late-night street parking near bars is where 90% of vandalism happens I suspect.

My biggest worry is shopping center parking lots. Since the day I saw some idiot use her Explorer's door to tag the fender of a Rolls Corniche and walk away without even a glance backward, I've realized there is a more sinister force than vandalism out there -- stupidity.

The problem is, where do you park? Another poster pointed out that parking in empty areas makes your car more conspicuous. Too true! Another drawback of parking in an empty area is that your car is exposed on both sides. I've actually seen a beater driver park within a foot of my car in a huge near-empty truck stop parking lot. He took care not to strike my door when he got out, but I can't help but wonder what prompts this behavior of having to park next to another car -- some kind of primordial herding instinct perhaps.

Anyway, somebody on one of these boards gave a piece of parking-lot advice that has stood me in good stead: Park beside another nice car. Your exposure is reduced 50% from the get-go, and chances are, the owner of the other car will be considerate. (I always try to park beside the driver's door rather than the passenger's.)

Having a ding-free car is a short-term condition for anybody in today's world. (Same goes for windshields -- I got mine replaced last week and will actually be relieved when it gets its first chip.) Being ding-free is like virginity: of dubious real value, temporary by nature if not design, and gone before you know what happened."
4259,"April 2, 2004 8:37PM",ljflx,"You post made me think of something I saw once and had almost forgotten about. Once while waitning for the bus in a parking spot at my old bustop I watched a woman pull into a spot about 20 feet away. It was a brutal cold morning with snow coming in later that day so people stayed in their cars until the bus showed up. This woman parked in a row where there were about 4 or 5 cars than her open spot then two more cars and then the entire rest of the row - maybe 40 spaces were empty, plus the parking spaces behind those spaces were vacant. Worse still was that she decided to back into this spot and the spot was very tight. She could have parked 10 feet away and posititioned her car the same way without having to back in. But she chose this herculean task of parking. Don't remember her car or the cars on either side of her spot but they weren't high end. It must have taken her 3 or 4 minutes to park and she could barely open her door when she was finished. I was almost tempted to go up to her and ask her what in the world was she thinking. I can't even begin to understand the logic of people like that."
4260,"April 2, 2004 9:51PM",oac,"Very exciting news from Toyota/Lexus....The article did answer most of my questions on the IS as well. Thanks syswei for this link.

A 600bhp (V8) LS sedan with 50mpg ??
A 400bhp (V6) GS sedan with 60mpg ??

Smelling blood ? That is an understatement ! These cars will truly revolutionize the industry as we know it today. And they are scheduled to be out within the next 24 months. That is even more astounding !!!

Not too long ago, GM was touting its plans for Hydrogen gas-powered cars as the way forward. They challenged and ridiculed Toyota's gas-electric hybrid plans. To top it off, GM even speculated they could have a production version of Hydrogen-powered vehicles by 2010. No one in the industry believed the latter timeline. Well, it didn't take long for GM to do an about-face and they have now abandoned this ludicrous idea and agreed that Toyota's PZEV gas-electric hybrid was the correct business model (similar to Intel's 64-bit Itanium chip design vs AMD's Opteron 32-bit/64-bit chip design approach - guess which model won out ? AMD's. Now Intel is forced to go the same route as AMD ... and poof goes the ~$2B already spent on their 64-bit plans. Ouch !!!).

With the US consumption of fossil fuel-based gasoline increasing, and very questionable world oil reserves, Toyota should make a killing on these hybrid cars. Ljflx is absolutely right. The list of buyers for the LS and GS will be long indeed !!! In some cities, many potential Prius owners are waiting up to 9 months, others have been told they should just wait until next year for the 2005 version. That is a sign of things to come for the RX400h, GS350 GT and LS500 GT. Anyone wants a GS better get in line right now."

I don't have confidence in fuel based German cars right now so I wouldn't go near a new technology based car with that crew until they prove themselves. My ex-boss told me a Cayenne story that will amaze you. He was going to buy one and had it delivered to his door. When it arrived he sat behind the wheel and it wouldn't start. A technicality was cited. So they brought it to a shop - supposedly corrected the problem - and brought it back two days later. Car still wouldn't start. They brought the shop mechanic to his house but he couldn't diagnose the problem. So he told them to keep it. Porsche has written him an apology letter.

As for Lexus - they will also target the performance market for the first time and they will probably do it first class and near perfect - like the origonal LS400. It will be hard for anyone to resist their cars or make the accusations seen on this board in the past. Most importantly - for me - I will have 100% confidence that Lexus will make the hybrid as near perfect as the gas engined cars. I will have no such faith in MB, BMW or Audi doing the same when they counter. Jaguar - maybe because I thought I read they did a deal with Toyota. But I'm not an XJ fan.

Lastly - Toyota has patented virtually everything they've done in the hybrid space. So it will be interesting to see how this plays out on the business side. By the way I've been in the showroom 3 times in 10 days and the foot traffic is the most I've ever seen. They are quite busy even during the week. Saturdays are a circus. That's why I picked up the car last night. It's still not easy to get a GX - they are pre-sold well into May and the LS is pre-sold for all of April.

4272,"April 3, 2004 11:36AM",merc1,"Lots of dreamy talk going on in here about Lexus I see. All the hundreds of thousands of MB diesel owners who kept their cars all these years haven't been waiting for a new diesel model. Makes sense to me. The average person (most Lex fans too) doesn't even know about diesel technology, except for the 1980s or what they've read in the past. Hello...diesel technology has changed in the last 10 years! When the cleaner diesel shows up for 2006 you can bet BMW, MB and Audi will be selling diesels here and in good numbers, right along with Japanese hybrids. All this talk about hybrids putting the Europeans out of business or the market is the same talk from 1990, and it didn't happen then. The 3 Germans luxury car makers (for better or worse) are still present.

Lexus is going to make a 400 or 500hp LS model to sell to people who already think 290hp is enough and don't even care about hp, or at least when someone else does it. All that talk about how dangerous hp is I guess doesn't apply to a 500hp LS because it will somehow be safer with its 4 sec 0-60 times and 155mph+ capablilies, as will its driver. Only people who own E55s and M5s drive wreckless.

MB, BMW and Audi better abandon all their high-hp cars because the everyone will want a hybrid. Nonsense.

There will be room on the market for both concepts. Not everyone will want to deal with the complexity of a 400hp Hybrid, or a diesel. Neither concept is going to replace the regular S500 or LS430. Nor will these concepts replace cars like a M or AMG series.

Oh my ! Just imagine MB copying Lexus ????

I know this looks like a Lexus-fest, with us Lexophiles excited about our prefered auto manufacturer's future. BUT, there is plenty to be excited about Toyota/Lexus' future prospects in the auto industry.

BTW, on a different note, I have always wondered why MB canibalizes their own trim lines with so many clones. For example:

CLK vs CL - why ? Both are 2-door coupes, but differ greatly in price (engine hp difference ?)
SLK vs SL - why ? Both are 2-door roadsters, but hugely different price-wise (engine hp difference ?)

Where is Merc1 when you need answers to MB questions ?"
4274,"April 3, 2004 12:04PM",merc1,"Why have a CLK and CL? Have you taken the time to look at the two cars? As good as the CLK is the CL is in another league. Styling, features, engines and technology seperate the two cars mainly. The CLK, unlike the CL is also available in a convertible.

The SLK and SL. Come on now, you don't see the reason or difference here? The SL is the luxury roadster and the SLK is more of the sports car, or at least wants to be. We'll have to see what the new one does.

Why does Lexus have the LS430 and GS430 when then are so close in base price? What is it 48k vs 56K(?) for two cars with the same engine? Same reason why Mercedes has the CLK/CL and SL/SLK, sure some of them share engines, but their missions are different. I can't believe you don't see that? The LS is the luxury car first, the GS is sportier, ditto SL and SLK, same for the CLK and CL.

Both the SL and SLK are so far apart in price and mission to the point of almost never being cross shopped. How many Lexus fans would consider the SL? Quite a few according to these boards, but I've never seen any of them mention the SLK. Same goes for the CL and CLK, their prices are waaay apart, and they both sell as well or outsell anything else in their price range. The CL in particular makes it market segment, as the only true competitors might be the Aston-Martin DB7, Jaguar XK8/R Coupe and certain Ferraris, which are way more $$$$$$. There is no canibalization going within MB in the least. None.

Don't believe in having more models? Lexus does. You can bet there will be a new IS Coupe, Convertible and Sedan, just the like the 3-Series and V8 performance variant. Why have the SC430 and a IS??? Convertible? Different cars thats why. If anything Lexus (if they do all these variants of the next LS) will be using the S-Class/7-Series rulebook about variety in that class.

For the record the only companies that canabalize their own sales are the Japanese. The LS430 has rendered the GS430 obsolete when Lexus buyers go looking for a upscale sedan, they barely move 150 GS430s a month. Look at obvious annihilation of Acura's RL with the TL. Look at the spec sheet for either the previous TL Type S or the new 2004 TL and I bet you couldn't come up with one valid reason to buy a RL. It's hopelessly outdone by its cheaper sibling, has been since 2002. Look the Q45 vs the M45 at the Infiniti house. Same interior, engine and everything, only difference is styling, room and price, and even worse one was a sales dud (Q45) before the other (M45) arrived. If anything the Japanese need to learn how not to canibalize their own cars. No non-AMG/M model Mercedes-Benz or BMW show up their higher priced siblings like this or interfere with their sales. If there is one thing Mercedes and BMW know how to do is place their model lineup correctly. Now the CLS will test this theory.

I guess it is every Lexus fan's dream to have MB or any other Euro maker copy Lexus since just the opposite has being happening since 1990.

They want the headlines and they are going to set the goals and the bar very high.

I'm sure hybrids will catch on big time in the luxury class, as they have with the masses no doubt, but to say MB, BMW and Audi should give up big hp and sporty models is absurd. I mean really how does anyone here know that diesels won't catch on again here? I mean aren't luxury car buyers astute enough to know or at least learn (research) that diesel technology is not the same as it was during the admittedly crummy 1980s?

I disagree totally that sales figures determine which car is better for the U.S. market, you're ignoring price which is a facter here. Even still the LS only outsold the next two cars by about 5K units thats hardly resounding proof of anything especially when you look at what the entry level S-Class and 7-Series costs.

They took fifty-three percent of the market. Now if we have a truly sustained period of high gas prices, then things will change, this is only a blip...as or right now (disclaimer). Suvs will go first and then gas guzzling luxury cars, one group has enough money not to make knee-jerk buying decisions, ther other doesn't.

BMW and Audi aren't going to sit still with hp either.

The appeal will be if Lexus does these hp numbers with better gas mileage, which I don't doubt they will, but that will probably be the only advantage of buying one, 400hp is still 400hp.

I know you were talking about annual sales, my point is that many a Benz diesel owner have been waiting so they shouldn't have a problem moving diesels here again, there is a pent-up demand. There is no way for either of us to know whether or not they'll be successful, its all speculation at this point.

Hence I rather the money be spent on things that you can enjoy all the time.

Four kids just got killed on a winding stretch of the Northern state pkwy in Long Island - where I've seen that type of driving often.

4290,"April 3, 2004 5:15PM",sv7887,"Hi All,
  Like all the Lexus owners here, I'm quite excited about the upcoming hybrids. Here's a few reasons why I think the Hybrid will be more popular
1) It makes use of existing Gas stations, no one has to go searching for diesel
2) It's cleaner than a comparable gas or diesel alternative.
3) The performance of a hybrid is significantly enhanced and it gives higher gas mileage to boot.
4) It's a revolutionary technology, not an evolutionary one as the newer diesels are. These sort of things generate a buzz, as the Prius has for the past few years.

It's a safe bet that the industry will be moving toward this technology given the pros. Toyota has already licensed it to Ford, and I feel it's only a matter of time before the others adopt it. Toyota will be at a signficant advantage given that they own most of the patents.

Provided the new LS looks as good as the original, I'll be trading my '02 LS in 2007. All this revolutionary technology is nice, but I won't bother buying the car if it's yet another S Class clone. Let's see whether Lexus is really dedicated towards carving their own identity design wise.

From what I hear, the days of rusting gas tanks and other horrendous repairs are past..For the most part, owners comment on minor repairs here and there.

However I do think it a very important technology, and Toyota (and to some extent Honda) are clearly ahead of others. As long as the technology is still on a path of significant improvements, Lexus may stay a step or two ahead, and this will enable it to either gain some market share or improve profitability or a bit of both.

We have all heard it before but it cannot be overstated -- Lexus has so many early owners begging, pleading, dreaming, agonizing over the successive LS400 ""design refinements"" which clearly were morphing to the S Class. Year after year, disappointment after disappointment :-(.

I read these LS 430 posts and am impressed by the joy it brings to the owners. But, the two times in the past 6 months that I have dragged myself to a dealer and looked at the car I still couldn't do it. ""Have a seat inside, Sir"" the salesman would offer. ""No thanks. I have no question about the inside or the ride. That's not my problem"" I would reply. Seriously -- two times.

And it really has been ""my problem"" since Lexus didn't seem to have any misgivings and buyers aren't staying away. So, my longing for the low running, gently curvacious, subtle lines of my '92 LS400 would stay unfulfilled.

Sounds a bit romantic, doesn't it? Well, I thought since we already have a lot of discussion on reliability, ride, speed, electronics, owner's manual, Consumer Reports, and the like, why not just plain old romance? We all know that it is a factor most of the time, so let it come out!

 I couldn't agree with you more on the Romantic aspect of buying a car. It is what made me buy my 92. One look was all it took in 1990, as I watched one drive by me. For two years I snuck up to LS400's in the parking lot and peered inside. I finally got sick and tired of looking and bought one.

I nearly traded it in for a '98 three years back. The next morning I ran back to the dealer to pull it out of the deal. There is just something about that car, perhaps it's the flair of the design. Maybe it's just the feel the car has to it, like it was built to last forever. I liked the 1998, but it was rather bland in design. The '02 has plenty of electronic toys, but doesn't do much for me in terms of styling. I only buy these cars as I'd like my primary car to be under warranty.

This whole Romance idea is what has drawn me to the XJ8 (98-03) Sure, it's not the most advanced car out there, but it is unique. There is nothing that spells elegance more than a XJ. From the sleek exterior to the amazing gentleman's club interior it's really something. Durability issues aside, I think the 98-03 car is one of the best looking of the whole lot.

I have to say, we really haven't considered the whole Romance factor in the purchase decision. Perhaps this is one of the intangibles others have refered to on this board.

  I think the GT has a refreshing look. It's definitely unique. That sort of underscores what is routinely discussed here. Each manufacturer needs to have it's own look. I am not terribly impressed with the latest offerings from MB, BMW, Lexus, and Jaguar. Here are my gripes:

1) BMW= I think Bangle says it all..It looks like something out of a Taiwanese cartoon..The Z4 and 745 just look too bloated
2) MB= For $90K You think they could design a rear end that doesn't look like it was stolen from a Honda. The low profile of the car, however, is great. The interior design is pretty good, but you'd think it would be more luxuorious for the $$$.
3) Lexus= Competely insipid designs here. The RX330 gives me some hope for the future. I wish they'd made the LS430 with those new headlights from the beginning. It adds a bit of spice to an otherwise dull design. I wasn't going to trade in my '02 though for just that. The Interior is like a palace, but it isn't as sleek as the Original LS. The dash seems abit bulky to me.
4) Jaguar=Ahh! Why did they mess with Perfection? The new XJ looks too much like the X type. The lines of the new car seem less well defined. The rear of the car is just disappointing. It lacks the flair of the previous model. At least it retains the 1st class interior.

They didn't copy it - just lifted some styling cues and in my opinion perfected them into a gorgeous car. Personally I don't think there's anything wrong with lifting styling cues from another design - nor would it ever affect a purchase decision on my part - but some MB lovers need to think that the company does everything from scratch and leads in everything. It doesn't and it can't. No company can. Interior of S-class is nice but it leaves a lot to be desired given the cost of the car.

7 series - 2-4 different car designs combined into one. Great front end though. Decent interior that is very mens clubbish.

Jag - timeless to so many - just never appealed to me before or after re-design. Also too cramped inside for my needs but a stunning interior.

LS430 - I think the new 2004 brings back some of the LS400 look. The latter was a timeless classic car as far as I'm concerned. Interior is stunning and a lot nicer than old model. But I liked that interior as well. It was more business like, this one is more homey.

A8 - beautiful in and out - very original, probably the most, along with the 7 of any car here. But Audi got it right. I just don't like the ride of the car or its reliability record. But there are so few on the road and thats nice if you own or lease one.

Thanks for the MB future engine update. I have been traveling for business and had to catch-up on the postings.

I am still very interested in the current and future S600. I think that the current S-class are just beautiful automobiles especially after the recent slight exterior updating. Also, although I like the brief new S-Class pictures on Autospies, I am concerned about the potential looks of the future S-Class if it looks too much like the new E-Class. Basically, although the new E-Class looks good it is not wearing on me as well as I believed it would.

One thing I love about the MB V-12 (versus the BMW and Audi) is the loads of torque - thanks to the dual supercharging. There has been a lot of post that are focusing only on HP but with typical USA drivers and overcrowded highways high torque is more practical.

I spend much of my driving time in the US either driving on the eastern I-95 corridor (mostly around NYC or DC) and then in Texas. This is also with a few occasional cross country drives when my schedule permits during rare weeks. (Note: Even though I have one of my homes in Texas, I have to say that Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma must have the worst drivers in the US - many no doubt directly from Mexico).

That being said, the US has to have the worst average drivers of most any industrial country in the world. It is a joy to drive in Europe or even in parts of California and Washington (other then clogged metro rush hours) where drivers move to the right lane and other wise display proper driving habits and training.

A luxury car with lots of torque allows me to shot away, between and beyond these $@*%#&amp; drivers. I guess this is much like the postings many of you were doing on luxury cars getting scratched.

4307,"April 4, 2004 9:22PM",johncalifornia,"I bought my 1998 XJ8 (anthracite/black) two months ago with 50K on the clock. It's going in this week for an oil change with 54K miles, and highly enjoyable ones, too.

I'll be using an honest and competent Jag specialty shop -- like most enthusiast owners I avoid the dealer service departments whenever possible. They're exorbitantly expensive for routine operations like oil changes, and prone to swapping components rather than repairing them -- a costly approach when the warranty is expired. (I don&#146;t bother with third-party warranties.)

I bought my XJ8 privately from a VERY fussy original owner (I had to prove I&#146;d take good care of his car!) and have all the car&#146;s records, including the original bill of sale. Most of my test drive involved my watching how the owner drove the car. I'd consider buying an XJ from the used section of a Jag dealership, but would never buy a used Jag from a non-Jag used car lot -- they can provide no service history, which is essential in my opinion.

My '98 already had its weak points attended to: the water pump and throttle body had been replaced under warranty. The 1998 - 2000s have Nikasil engines but I'm in California so don't have to worry about high-sulphur gas. If you're in a high-sulphur region you should consider getting a leak-down test to see if high-sulphur gas has damaged the cylinder bores. If the answer is no, your Nikasil engine should run for hundreds of thousands of miles &#150; they virtually never wear out.

The secondary cam chain tensioners are a weak point on this engine. They usually give warning when prematurely wearing -- rough running at start and clattering in the timing chain area. My engine runs like silk from fire-up but at 80K miles or so I'll spend $750 to replace the cam chain tensions purely as a precaution.

Why did I buy the XJ? My previous car was a 1995 BMW 740i, an outstanding car in every way. I wanted something more intimate and was willing to trade some performance for luxury and ambiance.

The Jaguar has proven to be a peerless cruiser. It makes my 75-mile daily commute in the Bay Area's chaotic traffic almost a pleasure. Unlike the BMW, where I'd boom along in the fast lane in a futile attempt to ""make time,"" the Jag and I happily putter along at 65 in the middle lane while I enjoy music from my iPod through the excellent (optional) Harman Kardon sound system.

As the old saying goes, you'll know within 10 minutes of driving one whether you're a Jaguar man. If you discover you are, be ready to get a lot of attention. Even in the affluent area I live in, XJs are, if not rare, not commonplace either, as are all the big German, American and Japanese luxury models. The XJ gets more admiring looks than any car I've been in since my 1970 XKE roadster. Unless you're big (over 6 feet tall, or obese), you'll find the interior a warm and relaxing environment. So much so that to my surprise, I don't stress about making time anymore -- I just sit back in that Connolly leather and, while making room for the tweaker from the adjacent lane to butt in ahead of me, make a mental note to replenish the Gray Poupon so we'll have something to go with the leftover roast leg of lamb.

The &#146;98 XJ8 is functionally ""all there."" You won't miss anything if you're transitioning from a luxo-car of similar vintage. If I had my druthers (and the big dollars required) I'd look for a 2002 &#150; 2003 Vander Plas Super V8 variant of the XJ. But they are extremely rare and their prices are staying well up in the stratosphere -- while at the same time you can get a well-kept '98 XJ like mine for well under $20K.

Be careful of used XJRs: while good ones are to be had, a lot these supercharged models were leased, thrashed, not regularly maintained, returned to the Jag dealerships, and, failing to qualify for Jaguar&#146;s stringent Select Edition standards, auctioned off to be sold by independent used car lots. My service shop says such cars will have far more powertrain issues than regular or VDP XJs.

I like ALL cars and don&#146;t see why so much time is wasted on this board in pointless debate about German vs. Japanese. At some other phase of my life I&#146;d gladly have a big Lexus or Mercedes. I&#146;ve already had a big BMW and loved it. My honeymoon with the XJ has been such a success, however, that I won&#146;t find myself missing any of the others anytime soon. To carry on your analogy between women and cars, and bring back a George Harrison song at the same time, there&#146;s just SOMETHING about way she moves. . . ."

We disagree on what makes a ""luxury"" car obviously. Leather doesn't define it for me.

I'm not trying to say you don't know what you're talking about here, but with the engine thing you really would benefit from doing some research first. Mercedes-Benz has used DOHC 4-Valve-per-cylinder technology in 1980s with the 190E 2.3-16V and again from 1989-1997 with all of their V8, inline 6 and 4-Cylinder engines during those years. The 3-Valve-per-cylinder SOHC engines were/are the ""new"" designs that Mercedes ""implemented"" not the DOHC 4valve setup. If you're going to say that Lexus was first with a V8 setup like this, you'd be wrong there also. Ferrari and other sports car makers did it back in the 50's and Mercedes also launched a DOHC 4v V8 in 1989 with the 500SL. I know you'd like to think otherwise, but Lexus is hardly ""first"" at anything.

Mercedes, Ferrari, Maserati, Porsche, Alfa-Romeo, Audi (among others) used this technology before Lexus was even thought about. Toyota does not hold a patent on DOHC 4-valve technology so no other company has to consult Toyota about anything, much less a patent. Audi does a 5valve per cylinder layout as does Ferrari and Toyota wouldn't have to ask them anything if they wanted to design their own 5-valve per cylinder engine. BTW, Toyota had 4-valve per cylinder engines (I4 and V6s) before the 1990 LS400 also; I'm surprised you didn't know this. Aluminum, DOHC 4valve-per-cylinder, V8 engine construction all in one combination wasn't Toyota ""first"" either, Mercedes was there as was Ferrari and others before the mighty Toyota.

syswei,

I'm not sure what happened with that, but I too remember something about them at least ""talking"" with Toyota about their hybrid technology. I couldn't get a straight answer from any of the MB reps at Detroit about anything pertaining to drivetrain of the GST, so I'm not sure. Mercedes and the rest of the European makers are so heavily invested in diesels so their hybrid tech and plans are obviously years behind Toyota and Honda, so I'm not sure. All MB has said is that hybrid S-Class will be sold here, I'm guessing with the next generation.

Toyota must feel pretty good. I mean really you have your competitors (Ford and Nissan) scrambling to buy your OLD technology, I'm impressed. (Rare moment, take note..lol)

ljflx,

Well as always my friend we are on opposite sides of the world when it comes to styling. You see ""cues"" from a Ford in an S-Class, but you can't see where the LS430 (especially 01-03) looks like a smoothed over Avalon. You say that every company can't be original or do anything from scratch, which is the reasoning any Toyota fan must come up with when looking at their various styling blunders and c____s I guess. European car makers as a whole are far more original than the Japanese, this isn't even debatable when you look at BMW, Jaguar, Audi, MB, Porsche, and others, their designs connect with the past without looking retro at that. Lexus has nothing to draw on here, but the car the consider to be the target. A Jaguar will never, ever look like an Audi.

The difference between MB and Lexus is that MBs don't look like their competitors, like Lexus' premier car does. So what if the S-Class resembles a Taurus (in your opinion), they'll never be confused like the old S and LS could be by the casual observer, nor are they competitors. That everyone can't be original is just a grand excuse. All the rest of the cars in this class manage to do just that, from scratch and very original. I mean really, think about it, none of the cars we talk about this board look anything alike until you bring the LS into the fold then you're reminded of 12 year old Benz. Lexus with their LS is the one that can't seem to be original or do anything from scratch, not the rest.

Anyway, past that S-Class/Taurus thing I pretty much agree with your summation on the other cars. I really want to drive the A8 or Phaeton to see what all the complaints about the ride are all about. Design wise I find the A8 to be the best car in this class now, just a hood ornament ahead of the S.

sv7887,

I was ready to ""disagree"" with your post #4601 Item #2, but then I read item #3 so.....

jamesfletcher2,

Well I'd say go for the current S600 if you're worried about the next generation styling changes. Plus the reliability of the current S (one of your concerns) is much improved since 2000 and you won't have to worry about the next generation car's newness in that area.

Maserati had the oldest one that I could find that was a real DOHC V engine.

Here's a few Toyota ones for you to enjoy: The first is for a DOHC V multivalve engine. The second for a variable valve timing (VVT) engine. The third for multivalves (intake) per cylinder and the fourth is for a really neat light alloy rocker arm that could be adjusted while the engine was running. The prior art on that one was a cast iron BMW rocker arm.

The assignee on all of these ( 4 for the 43 ) was Toyota.

4311,"April 5, 2004 7:48AM",merc1,"The patents you list still don't disprove what I said earlier that Toyota wasn't first, Maserati or Ferrari were. Nor does MB have to even look in Toyota's direction for anything in the way of licensing or permission to do DOHC V8 because Toyota doesn't hold squat today on this type of engine design. A DOHC V8, Toyota FIRST did not offer 32Valve V8. Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati and Mercedes all did it before (the first three) or at the same time (Mercedes) as Toyota did.

Toyota wasn't first in the luxury area either, both MB and Toyota offered DOHC, multivalve V8s in the same year, 1989, for the 1990 model year.

I don't need a list of patents to know this, hence the difference between you and I. You live for patents and stats about things like engines when they don't even tell the story, especially when it comes to who got the patent first vs. when the technology was actually on the street in the hands of actual buyers. I remember it when it was being done, not when a patent office told me so. You wouldn't even know any of this if it weren't for the patent office.

Neither you nor I mentioned variable valve timing, so I'm not sure why you're listing that, it wasn't in question with me. Lets stay on track here.

Didn't say Toyota doesn't have useful technology, I said that they are not first in most cases. They are the masters at improving technology that has already been laid down by others.

Like I've said before you seem to always miss this, patents can be and are given for improvements to existing technology also. Toyota wasn't first to offer a DOHC multivalve V8, nor does Mercedes or anyone else have to consult them before offering their own design, which was my point. You tried to imply that Mercedes in 2004 would have to get some sort of permission or licensing from Toyota to ""implement"" DOHC multivalve technology and my answer to that is still that Toyota wasn't first to do a DOHC 32V V8, nor does MB have to seek their approval of anything and that MB has done this type of engine before. These points still stand, regardless of you finding patents about (irrelevant) VVT and rocker arm details, as these two details have nothing to do with what you said earlier.

4314,"April 5, 2004 9:28AM",footie,"Merc1,

If you don't think that the entire auto industry, just like high tech, food processing, pharmaceuticals and just about every manufacturing company that does business in this country doesn't 'look' at intellectual property held by others and try to insure that theirs is protected, then you have missed a key piece of how business works.

Virtually all 'big' businesses also cross-license IP with each other. It's the smart thing to do, because you don't get caught with your shorts down. Their internal legal shops have IP lawyers and the companies sit down with each other every year at about this time to 'settle' on who's patents are in use and negotiate their relative value. You can bet that Toyota, Honda, DaimlerBenz, VW, BMW, GM, Ford, Nissan, etc. are all cross licensed.

For example, Texas Instruments used to pay Bell Labs a significant net royalty on their patent portfolio because of Bell's fundamental transistor patents. However, when those expired and TI later gained key patents in the microchip area, the money flowed the other way.

In general, all patents issued before 1987 have expired (the old 17 year rule). Starting with patents filed in 1995, 20 years is generally the life of the patent.

Also, the larger and more current your intellectual property portfolio, the better your protection, the stronger your internal focus on developing and protecting innovation and the more likely the money flows your way.

IBM was awarded 3,215 patents last year and has 23,000 they actively license. The generally are the largest recipient of patents each year in the world.

Companies that develop proprietary technology and deploy it in production and sell it to others without patent protection, put the technology in the public domain. Anyone could use it.

For example, if there was something unique and innovative about a 7-speed transmission then DCX would patent it, because selling it without protection would allow anyone to 'copy' it freely. DCX hasn't filed any patents on the 7 speed transmission because it's just incremental technology. DCX has filed a few CVT patents in 2001 - 2004, so maybe they've figured out that when the number of speeds in a transmission approaches infinity that it becomes continuous, sort of like a polygon with an infinite number of sides is called a circle."
4315,"April 5, 2004 9:56AM",merc1,"Actually I'm quite familiar with patents as I've invested into one with a family members. Great idea (the patent), but wrong people to do business with (family), but that is a whole other story. Amazingly I don't really disagree with any of that, but maybe I should have just answered your original question in the first place.

No, Mercedes doesn't have to get any licensing permission from Toyota for their upcomming DOHC engine designs, and no Toyota wasn't first at this, and yes Mercedes has done a many DOHC engines before.

The fact that Toyota has so many patents for smaller details only goes back to highlight what I said before in answer to your implication that the LS400 was first with this engine design, Toyota only improves up existing tech, most of the time and they don't hold anything currently that MB would need to consult them on because A) Toyota wasn't first to begin with and the details that they had a patent on has expired, and MB or anyone else needs to consult them this particular engine design. Every automaker under the sun uses DOHC technology.

Mike,

If you can honestly tell me what was ""best"" about Toyota's 1989 DOHC V8 design compared to Mercedes' of the same year, then you'd have something to stand on here, otherwise you're just posting for the sake of doing so with nothing factual to bring to the table. Do you even know what those 43 patents are and what they mean or are you just arguing pointlessly again?

M"
4316,"April 5, 2004 10:07AM",footie,"Merc1,

It's fun to say stuff like that, and I am sure your feelings are heartfelt.

I would guess that neither of us have any factual information regarding the patent details of the DOHC engine that MB is introducing.

To say otherwise, you'd have to be member of their technical staff or IP law department.

In fact, since I believe that since Toyota and virtually everybody else in the industry is cross-licensed, Mercedes would be crazy not to use what Toyota made available to them through licensing if it were more quickly available than internal development and the same would be true about Toyota using MB technology."
4317,"April 5, 2004 10:11AM",merc1,"But you're missing the point they've done DOHC engines before, back in 1989 the same time Toyota did, DOHC ENGINES ARE NOT NEW FOR MERCEDES-BENZ. There was also a DOHC engine 190E during the eighties. This is not new technology for MB!!!

4318,"April 5, 2004 10:14AM",syswei,"I think what Michael Mattox means is that doing something best is more important than doing it first, a sentiment I agree with. Some data on MY2004 engines:

BMW 4.4 liter: 325 hp, 330 lb-ft

Lexus 4.3: 290/320

MB 4.3: 275/295

So based on what is currently shipping, at least, BMW has done the ""best"" of the three with engines, MB ""worst""."

Argue, as you will, over the years the Lexus has proven to be more reliable then the Mercedes. Maybe all those patents had something to do with it and maybe not...I don't know, and frankly don't care because I believe BEST trumps FIRST."
4320,"April 5, 2004 10:24AM",merc1,"Ok the point has been officially lost here. I wasn't saying that MB was the ""best"" here because they were first, only that they used DOHC technology either before or at the same time as Lexus did, when talking about V8s. Nothing more. I never at any point said that MB was best, if I did please point this out to me because I don't see it written or remember posting it here. 2004 cars were not part of the discussion. Of course BMW's new V8 is superior in the here and now, look at the details on that thing. Naturally the details don't matter when they're lost on you, and it all reverts back to reliability.

I have finally realized that on this board it is pointless to talk about anything else but reliability, it is the end-all of the automobile. Even a simply debate about engine design back in the day reverts to an updated reliability sermon.

4321,"April 5, 2004 11:57AM",andy71,"Since we are talking about reliability, I am old enough to remember the Mercedes SEL which I believe was the predecessor of the S class.

4326,"April 5, 2004 2:47PM",michael_mattox,"I remember those days, Mercedes were concedered the best...

1) Did they forget how to still make them that way?

2) Or... do they still make them just as well but the standards have changed? What was good in those days is just AVG. today."
4327,"April 5, 2004 6:22PM",footie,"1) IMHO, I think that they make them different on purpose as a consequence of the marketplace. Plus vehicle technology has changed a lot. The tanks of the past aren't really very modern any more, even though they feel solid. The current S is a lot more nimble than the barges of the 80's and early 90's. Plus MB may be focused on lower cost of production to support more spending on merchandising and marketing. It's a brand 1st, car 2nd for them to make it.

2) MB improved, but their rate of improvement year to year was much lower than Lexus and Infiniti. Once companies like Lexus get on an improvement track faster than yours, you don't know you are in trouble until they blow by, then you realize that they are moving at a rate faster than you are and you can't figure out how to catch them. It happened in the TV business here in the U.S. Where's Zenith and RCA? Where's their little neighborhood shops that would sell you a set and come adjust it when it got out of whack (all TV sets have problems right?). Nope. The route to success as the technologies changed was to make things that didn't break. Out of the box, into the family room, turn it on and watch it for 10 years. The underlying technology closes any gaps in performance and consumers finally figure that out.

As an aside, it will be interesting to see if DCX's acquisition of Chrysler is fatal to MB's chances of ever catching Lexus and Infiniti because the money required to invest heavily and change the way they do things at MB is being spent blowing air in the Chrysler life preserver."

I like my 2003 allroad interior and see an evolution of the things I like.

All this comparison to a Chevy truck doesn't quite convince me of anything.

All of these new German cars have some similar styling cues.

Frankly, I have to give Cadillac credit for the CTS, SVX and now STS -- they do seem ""fresher"" than many offerings from all over the world.

Now, FRESHER doesn't exactly mean that I like it better. But since I am at it, it just means that I don't like it less -- if you get my drift.

Frankly, after having seen some NY papers talking about the new STS (when I was in NYC last week), I would have to say I will test drive the STS AWD before I pull the trigger on a new A6.

We have 3 cars in the family with only 2 drivers. So how did the wife agree to do this ? Cos I positioned it as a car that she will actually get to drive the most. In addition, it will also become our 'work-horse' car for that quick trip to the grocery store, video store, or somewhere we really need to downsize so as not to attract too much attention. I then left the decision as to what car satisfies these conditions. See, that way, just like carnaught said, she gets to be part of the process, and may even be the enabler of the overall decision-making process. Finally, I take the low-ball route of speculating what price point that car should be, and knowing my wife that she would rather have a good quality thing than a cheapo stuff, I know the final purchase price will be much higher than whatever I speculate. That way it looks like the wife made the purchase at the higher price point than I could want. See, that way we BOTH wins !

All things being equal, which they never are, how can Cadillac go head to head with Audi, BMW and Mercedes at ""price parity?""

Wouldn't ""many"" buyers -- especially in year one and two of the new STS -- think, ""well if I'm gonna layout $60K for a Bimmer or a Cadillac"" go with the ""tried and true"" German?

I would think, realistically, that Cadillac would want to ""pull a Phaeton"" and come in 6 - 12% BELOW the European competition.

And, won't some Lexus folks scoff at a first year Cadillac STS -- especially one that is ""all new?""

I went to the Cadillac website and priced the CTS-V with the sunroof option -- which means virtually every possible thing -- and it came up to $51,195. Try pricing the BMW 545i -- with stick shift -- try $58K.

Wouldn't this ""equal content"" for lower bucks theory hold true until the marquis got further into its Led Zep transformation?

I have been arguing for a year that the Phaeton is a bargain (perhaps too strong a word), but the same argument would apply to the CTS-V and I would therefore extrapolate ""ditto"" to the upcoming STS.

For $66K, I can go elsewhere.

Sorry if I have responded too agressively, but I find it difficult to imagine that the new STS V8 will creep too far north of $55K -- at least for the first iteration.

Else, he said, perhaps the MSRP will be high, but the deals will be great -- much like the SRX deals (at least here in River City).

Of course, Audi could throw a curve and really crank up the price of the A6 -- but, with the new A8 short wheelbase just announced at $66K, it seems Cadillac will price itself out of the market until prospective buyers (such as me) become convinced that ""it isn't my Grand Father's car company any longer. . . .""

With current reliability and complexity woes of some of the German products, I don't think the STS will have too much of a problem being competitive. The interesting thing is that people will buy what they want regardless of price and competition. Think about the Phaeton. Why is the W12 version $25k cheaper than the A8L W12? They basically are the same car with the same equipment. However, I doubt anyone who wants the A8 will get the cheaper Phaeton.

As an LS owner, I am looking forward to the 2007 model year, and then we'll see, won't we ? If the new LS is anything close to the LF-S concept, I am SOLD ! That simple !!!

That's how good this 2004 is and 2007, when it arrives, will be a killer. I just hope I'm delayed enough at April 2 to avoid a wait list. But that is 3 years out anyway.

What people have said is that they find the LS to be boring (to them) compared to the other cars in the class. Big difference. Trust me, by reading all the comments about leather, paint colors, nav systems and stereos everyone here knows that you and other LS owners love their cars, it just doesn't sound exciting to others because they look for or place emphasis on different things in a car. One person's excitement is another person's yawn.

Merc1... Well said. In addition, I would point out that concept cars usually look better than the production models and give us insight into the talent of the designers and strategy of the marketers. That LF-C looks like a rough-hewn first draft that was never meant to be seen outside the think tank.

Anyway I&#146;m not going to dwell on concept cars but prefer to criticize the production models. My worst nightmare is coming to fruition Bangle is being copied. The back end of the 06 GS is painfully similar to the 5-series. Even the 05 RL, which I am mostly pleased with, shows Bangle motifs on the trunk although subdued.

LS crew I&#146;m glad you guys are happy with your cars and I am first in line with the respect I have for Japanese reliability. I surely hope the LS evolves into the elegant, continuously reliable car I&#146;m imagining and I believe they have a handle on the preferences of buyers in the upper end. But sorry, their designers are shooting in the dark as they are with the entire ugly Toyota lineup. If you believe the LS is immune from quality issues and the flaky, fashion whims of auto marketing you are kidding yourselves. But then again, I envy the blind faith that some of you have. If you can buy what they dole out without question, you are in some ways fortunate. I have no emotional equity in any brand. BMW and Porsche have appealed to me for a long time but BMW is now on my spit list. If Porsche reneges on it&#146;s evolutionary minimal design philosophy I&#146;ll drop them too, but I don&#146;t think it&#146;s going to happen anytime soon unless it&#146;s by default due to their financial concerns. The upcoming 997 911 in spy shots still presses my buttons. The fact that the Boxster is growing roots is a great sign. And watch out for that elusive Porsche sedan!

Merc1 Buick Velite I can see the SC430 impression, but mostly, I see three influences Infiniti, Mazda and Honda, specifically G35 and S2000. I find the elliptical trunk tier offensively discordant. The overall shape/lines are fluid and pleasing but the plagiarism sticks in my craw more &#147;me too&#148; risk management at work here."

4370,"April 9, 2004 7:20PM",sv7887,"Hi All,
  The Styling discussion here is quite telling. As I've said in earlier posts none of the carmarkers are really hitting me with their designs these days. Lexus' problem has been for a much longer duration than the others IMHO. As they refreshed their cars, (The LS in particular) the design became blander. Take the LS400..The 95 design was an awful attempt to preserve the old look. The 98 refresh looked better, but was a pretty bland looking design. The LS430 debut was disappointing in the sense that it very closely resembled the old S class.

After saying this, some might ask why I bother buying these LS cars..The bottom line was ownership experience. The LS at least still offers reliablity and durability second to none. I do feel on absolute terms their quality level has fallen from the original LS, but comparatively, it's still the benchmark. I only hope the '07 LS is better in aesthetics than the older cars. I'd seriously consider buying another nameplate if the '07 is yet another S Class clone.

4371,"April 11, 2004 7:03AM",ljflx,"I'm on a different page than you with the 95 and 98 LS cars. I thought they were both excellent updates of the original car. I preferred both to the 1990-1994 cars. From my view the redesigns replaced the boxy look of the original car with a sleeker more aerodynamic look but still maintained its overall style. As well I see Lexus quality equal to or even higher than the early 1990's. The 2004 is built like a tank and even the glovebox sounds like a bank vault when you close it. I also find the SC, GS, GX, LX and RX have incredibly high build quality. I can't speak for the IS and ES as I have hardly been in them.

Designman - 9 perfect years and 250,000+ perfect miles makes you stay loyal to a brand. It's that simple for me plus I love the design of the 2004 LS - in and out - and the ride, build quality and engineering even more. Its the same reason MB owners stayed so loyal to their cars for so many years. They delivered perfection or near perfection as well in the past. That's why I already have so much confidence in the 2007. I have no doubt it will be a beautiful car with meaningful general improvements over the 2004 model and a groundbreaking fuel technology that will be highly desired to boot. Hey - a bunch of owners are looking forward to a car that is three years out. That speaks volumes about the quality and equity of the brand."
4372,"April 11, 2004 7:55AM",ljflx,"Not really a board subject but maybe it should be. Per the NY Times the 2005 RL will have a 300HP V6, AWD and a NAV system that gives up to the minute traffic reports via XM satellite radio. Fully loaded it's a $50k car. Good looking car that should be hot. Puts the 5 series to shame in looks based on pix I saw. Given looks, new technology and Acura reliability this would hit my garage before an E-series as well. Looks like Acura has set its sights to compete more with the mid level German cars and the upcoming GS rather than go after the LS crowd which they had no chance to convert. Smart decision if that is the case."

People in polyester with penciled in names on their business cards aren't going to cut it.

In New England, most Caddy dealers are dualled with another GM line (during the lean years for Caddy, how else could they heat the building?). They are poorly positioned to go after the upscale customer. Poor facilities, poor people, poor locations in blue collar areas (e.g., Auburn, MA vs. Westboro, MA). etc. Does a software engineer, JD, MD, etc. really want to drop 60K on a performance sedan and then have to wait behind a Pontiac Sunbird customer for service?

The LF-S if I remember right was swoopy, low and had a very airy looking roofline. The new GS is just a rehash of the previous GS, only it looks even more bulbous and ungainly than before especially in the rear. The LF-S looked nothing like this. The two cars are completely different from the B-pillar rearward. There is big difference between carrying styling ""cues"" of a concept car and looking like a toned-down version of one. The new GS is neither compared to the LF-S. I'll review your case again though (lol) send me the link. Also, I don't remember DrFill changing his opinion on the new GS not looking like the LF-S, but I'll take your word for it because I don't remember what topic that was.

designman,

Yeah I saw that too on the new RL. The trunklid where it meets the back glass is slightly Bangle looking. Overall the new RL looks like a fancy Accord, even more so than the new TL, another bass-ackwards move from Honda. Some of the posters on the RL (future vehicles) board are seeing the same resemblance to the Bangle trunklid. The new RL looks awfully small too, so I'll have to see it in person. BTW, there is a new 530i in my parent's neighborhood, in Black. I have to say I like the new look on the 5, but never the 7.

That Buick is pretty good looking in my book, it would do wonders for their image. Now let us see if GM will allow Buick to build it and build it correctly.

4378,"April 11, 2004 10:45PM",merc1,"For the record the new Acura RL's V6 will at the very least will be competitive with the V8s in the middle-class in hp, while giving up a little ground in torque, and the delivery of it.

However to understand Honda as a whole is to realize why they won't build a V8. When you look the sales numbers of the E500 vs E320, GS430 vs GS300, 545i vs 530i, S-Type 4.2 vs 3.0, Q45, M45 and others you'll see that the 6-cylinder versions outsell the V8 versions anywhere from a little bit (E-Class) to a huge amount (GS300 vs GS430 is like 4 or 5 to 1) or they don't sell at all (Infinitis). V8s are mainly for image and a select few as the majority buy the 6-cylinder versions of these sedans.

 Honda being the little, shrewd, conservative company that they are can't see spending the $$ required to enter this segment with a class-leading car, which of course is what they would be shooting for. They aren't going to half do it, so it's all-out or no entry.

Think about it, to build class leading car like the TL in the upper segment would take a major investment from Honda: a 5-Series beating rwd platform and a brand new from the ground up V8. Honda's culture won't allow it to scrimp on either item...in other words big bucks would need to be spent. Those two things on top of making everything this class of car requires as standard equipment (the Acura way) would prove to be costly for Honda. They also need another car to spread the costs of that V8 and RWD over. What else would they use this new RWD chassis under? The new V8 could be shared with the next NSX, but the chassis probably couldn't (mid-engine placement). It will be another 10 years or so before Honda summons the courage (i.e. business case) to do a RWD V8 sedan. Remember how long it took them to put a V6 in the Accord?

If you look at any comparison of engines in car lines the smaller engine sells more units. The Camry 4 easily outsells its V6 brother. Its price, not engine size that does it.

Every car in their lineup is now sporty. Expect them to pilfer buyers from all corners including converts from pure luxury to sport-luxury with the RL. I could care less about a V8. Going from 220 to 300 hp is significant. And if it comes with a weight loss and tight sport suspension it will do the trick in my book.

TL seems to be a smash hit. Will RL hit back-to-back? I'll venture to say yes.

Based on the little I've seen and now read of it I'd take it on paper over the 5, GS, E or A6 and certainly over Infiniti's dreaded M45. But paper and the real world are two different stories so it has to be experienced first. You're right - you'll get all that great Acura reliability and build quality as well.

4393,"April 12, 2004 1:21PM",ljflx,"The new LS430 is spectacular. Rides like a dream, has tighter handling, more than enough road feel and is very quiet. The nappa leather is very rich and the antique walnut wood is stunning on the car. They've added nice touches from 2001. These are things like vanity mirrors that drop from the headliner for rear passengers (I am sure Lexus will turn these into DVD screens at some point), the rearview camera is great to have and the back-up sensors that detect something is behind you are there if you choose not to look at the camera view. There are other nice interior touches but I won't go into them here. The laser cruise is great and works perfectly on the highway and the car pushes itself to 75mph so effortlessly and so quickly that you stare down at the spedometer in disbelief that you are going that fast. Lastly smartkey is great. Like the nav system you wonder why you need it and once you have it you can't be without it. The only problem is that when I go to drive the GX I am expecting the door to open on contact with my hand like the LS does. But that lacks smartkey so it never does. My custom lux also has door closers and headlight washers. The only thing it really lacks is an air suspension. But the base suspension on this car is great anyway. Perhaps the best thing of all though is that Lexus has taken the body build of this car and the fit and finish to an even higher level if you can believe it. This car is a built like a tank. I also scored 23mpg on my initial refill of gas. Couldn't be happier with the car."

Some business guys would even trade every year for the $700 or difference. Poor people, poor urban people lusted after a used Caddy (I had a drill Sgt at Ft Dix who called his new Buick 225 a Deuce-and-a-quarter). Then the market changed, GM gave them glorified Impalas to sell, and their sons and daughters went to law school.

Do you think GM would be as badly screwed up if the senior management, Jack Smith on down, had to actually buy, drive and maintain their own cars from local dealers?

Nope, not my take on it at all. I so see a double standard however. You argued boo20 up and down about waiting lists and such, yet you yourself experienced the same thing at your dealership when buying a new LS430, yet an AMG Benz or some other hot Benz like a CLK Cabriolet couldn't possibly have a waiting list or anyone waiting for them. You seem to imply that because you and a few other Lexus fans are waiting for a 2007 LS model (that you know nothing about yet) will be hot because of it's drivetrain, yet when I suggested that a diesel Benz (you know a car that actually goes on sale this month) might be equally sought after, that notion was met with ""diesel won't make it"" and such.

I said my dealership (not the US or even a dealership 30 miles away) was sold out for April and that the Euro LS is hard to get around here. Go back and read my posts and tell me where I said there was a wait list. As for 2007 I am speculating and I honestly believe there will be so much demand for an LS hybrid that it will be a hard car to get at that time. What facts could I possibly have to support that other than my own intuition. Let's see how the RX hybrid plays out - that will certainly give the indications of what is to come. Someone else also said there is a long waitlist for the Prius. As well waitlists have to be tied in some way to production volume. Anyone can create a wait list - just produce a handful of cars.

Now - diesel cars have never been easy to sell here. I don't know anyone that has any desire to even look at one. This has nothing to do with MB and everything to do with how the American public buys cars. It buys gas engines because that is what it has been trained to do and that is how the business model is set up. Hybrids don't change that model, diesels do. Business models don't change very easily. Nor will they change when there is a logical alternative that maintains the current model. This is not about Benz at all. Why else would MB only commit 3000 CDI's for the US market. Because they are uncertain about diesel demand and market reserach doesn't give them any confidence that they can sell more.

Boo20 claimed that there were year+ wait list for cars across the whole US - in some cases ordinary E-500's, not even AMG's. So I look at my sunday paper and I see a bunch of them advertised for sale - prices and all - both ordinary cars and AMG's. Plus that was just a partial list. Thus I couldn't buy his story.

4403,"April 13, 2004 11:15AM",lenscap,"I'm not sure how you can say the LF-S and GS have different rooflines. That (and the greenhouse) is the part of the two cars that is nearly identical!

Also, the degree to which a concept matches a production car varies greatly. I don't think you can make a blanket statement on how other companies do it. Besides, Lexus has had many ""concept"" cars that turned out to be 99% the real thing. The 1997 GS concept and RX concept come to mind.

And of course you think the new GS is a letdown. I would be surprised to hear you say anything else.

I guess I'll let this one go and just agree to disagree."
4404,"April 13, 2004 1:22PM",maxhonda99,"lenscap,

Let's not forget the LF-S was about 50 inches tall, which right there made it unfeasible for production.

I believe a Clublexus forum had pictures of the production 06 GS and LF-S side by side from the same angle. I've been looking thru the posts but can't seem to find it. Anyway, the resemblance between the concept and production is unmistakable. The roofline, the kink in the C-pillar, the shoulder line, the short decklid, the side flanks of the car, the bumpers, grille, and headlight outline on the production GS are clearly derived from the concept."
4405,"April 13, 2004 2:04PM",lenscap,"The photos on clublexus that show the LF-S and GS side-by-side were in the link I posted that was removed by the moderators.

If you want to go look for it, go to the GS forum on clublexus. It is a topic dated 1-16-04 and titled ""LF-S & 3rd Gen. GS pics together.""

All of the similarities you state are obvious in the photos."
4406,"April 13, 2004 2:58PM",designman,Going from LF-S the GS is highly revised and in my opinion looks worse. Sometimes even the subtlest change makes a big difference ESPECIALLY with proportions. Among many other things I wouldn't have sent the roofline so far back... gives it a hunchback look. Even an inch would have made a difference. If you want a fast back you have to flatten the aft curve a bit. This also brings to mind the ugly Crossfire. I call the new 5-series the ultimate fruit cart. Think I'll call the GS Quasimoto. What's with these ugly rear ends anyway? Anybody have any theories? Even the Aston Martins went downhill. They used to have one of the best butts around. Now even they are ruined. Must be someone meddling at Ford.
4407,"April 13, 2004 4:25PM",ljflx,"No one at Lexus ever said the LF-S was the next GS. In fact I remember reading GS board posts in which posters believed the LF-S was going to be the next LS. I believe it was C&D that did show a picture of it at the Tokyo show and then said it was the next GS under the picture. But that was the only place I saw that. That story is what made me think it was the next GS.

lenscap - I can definitely see a lot of the LF-S style in it but I preferred the rear lights on the concept. I'm really anxious now to see it in person. You are right that in the past the production car was a nearly 100% twin of the concept. That was particularly true in the first RX."
4408,"April 13, 2004 6:11PM",sv7887,"Merc,
  For once we agree...Lexus at this point is going on hype at least exterior design wise..I have yet to see them turn out a real awe inspiring design. The RX330 was a glimmer of hope though..I am not impressed at all with the GS..The rear looks awfully close to an older Toyota Avensis. I only can hope the 07 LS is better. If it isn't I'll seriously consider buying an Euro brand. I think these design issues stem from the rush for ""Futuristic"" designs..The whole Traditional look seems to be out..

The only reason I think the Hybrid drivetrains will be more popular than the MB Diesels, is the novelty of it all..The Prius has created a buzz in showrooms, and Lexus will be able to take advantage of it. It's a new concept, rather than a tried and tested Diesel. I'm not discounting the MB Diesel, but we're used to them. Diesels aren't especially popular in the US, just as Manual Transmissions are not.

As a Lexus owner, I'm obviously partial to the brand..But I'm willing to concede the drawbacks of them..So far I think styling continues to be one. My own personal feeling is that the build quality has slipped from the original. Many a Lexus mechanic have told me that Lexus doesn't build cars like they used to..I feel the same way having owned LS cars from the beginning for Long durations..Long term quality is going to suffer in the face of this race to cram electronics into cars..

""You are right that in the past the production car was a nearly 100% twin of the concept.""

Well, I wouldn't exactly call the Lexus HPS a concept car in 1997 or the 1st generation RX300 when it was shown in ""concept"" form. They really were not concepts. They were full production cars with basically the only differences being things like wheels and grilles.

Also, I saw where that Lexus dealer is going to come up in Freehold right next door to David Michael Benz at the site of a Mazda dealer."
4410,"April 13, 2004 8:00PM",ljflx,"If you are ever in the market for a Benz - David Michael are good people to deal with. I've never seen a Lexus and MB dealership side by side and BMW is right across the street in King Cadillac/BMW. But I'll shop down in Ocean and service on Rt 9. Catena is a fabulous dealership - whether you are shopping MB, Lexus or Jaguar.

I wish they will build that HPX. I saw the MB version in Automobile and it is disappointing. It's concept also seemed to look much nicer than the final version - maybe too much platform sharing has hurt the concept design."
4411,"April 13, 2004 9:45PM",merc1,"No, my point was that you said that people are waiting for LS' and yet when the same was said about a BMW or MB you didn't believe it. The E500 was indeed scarce when it first arrived, and your local paper doesn't prove anything different. I don't know why you think that just because a dealer has a certain car in stock it means that nobody else is waiting for one to come in, i.e. they may not want the one in stock.

You're right about them testing the waters, but you're also forgetting that right now our diesel fuel is very dirty to put it simply and all the Euro makers are waiting for 2006 when low-sulfur diesel will be required by law. .

lenscap,

I'm in disbelief myself that you can look at the LF-S and the new GS and see the same roofline and rear end treatment, as they are totally different. You don't see how thick and ungainly the rear of the new GS is compared to the LF-S? My gawd you'll believe anything Lexus says or does. Even the people on the GS board don't see what you see. The fact is that if you look back at most European carmaker's concepts the production cars that follow are much closer to that concept than the GS is the LF-S. Even American carmakers get this. What is the point of showing a concept that has a roofline that isn't feasible for production and getting everyone's hopes up? Doesn't make sense. I think we will have to agree to disagree because either way the new GS is not a looker, imo.

4412,"April 13, 2004 10:12PM",merc1,"Should have known that JDP is behind the hysteria/hype about European car sales dropping. A whopping 6.9 percent drop in the first 3 months of the year really does spell the end. They'll be leaving the U.S. market in a year's time. Mercedes will probably have to exit before the end of 2004 because of the staggering 5 percent drop they've had so far this year. BMW being down 2.3 percent this year is also their death knell.

Yet the article doesn't mention that VW's entire lineup is old as all get out and that MB doesn't have a new product this year as at least possible reasons for sales dropping from last year, of which for MB was a record (best ever) year in the U.S.

This type of one-fact hype is typical of JDP because they think that reliability is the sole factor in car buying. Forget the average price of a ""domestic"" car compared to these high-end European cars that don't have a trunk full of rebate cash. Let us ignore every other possible factor (for sales dropping) because we want to get the public and carmakers ready for our big reliability study that comes out next month. We need for the sales numbers to prove that reliaibility is king so the automakers will buy our results.

M"
4413,"April 13, 2004 11:17PM",profvh,"Merc1 is exactly right in his comments about the
article on falling European sales. Powers is all
about reliability studies and their comments
reflect their own self interest. Also not mentioned is that European products are facing a
badly slumping US dollar which is forcing them to
raise prices or at least does not give them the
pricing leeway that the Japanese have. MB has
raised the price on the C Class about $950 since
the US dollar has been dropping. The Bank of
Japan has spent BILLIONS in the currency markets
to keep the yen value from changing much so they
can sell/discount their cars. The European
central bank has not interfered in the currency
markets or changed their interest rates to help
their companies better compete. Also, Japan has
changed their product mix to strongly favor SUV's
not sedans. Europeans still strongly favor sedans
in their product mix. What have Americans been
buying regardless of country of origin?

This simplistic article was written by an unsoph-
icated writer who should know better."
4414,"April 14, 2004 5:29AM",designman,"Is CR hype? Are owner testimonials hype? The Japanese made their bones with reliability and bang for buck. Americans suffered for a long time due to lack of it. They still suffer. Don't get stuck in THAT whirlpool. Reliability as buying factor isn't going away any time soon, and it only becomes magnified with rising prices. I wonder if questionable styling and frivolous technology is also hype.

No one is immune from market conditions, the consequences of their own marketing decisions, and consumer perception/preferences. European cars are in somewhat of a pillory now, both in fact and mind. Euro fans had better live with it because it is going to get worse before it improves, if it improves, and there is no guarantee this will happen.

Personally, I think those numbers that you make little of are going to get worse. In BMWs case they come on the heels of new products and redesigns. Is that 2.3% Group sales? I heard BMW Brand sales are down 8% YTD. Blame the Euro if you want but history has proven that the human love affair with the car rises above expense. People will spend. How they spend is another story."
4415,"April 14, 2004 5:29AM",footie,"Actually Merc and Profvh the article was published by the Detroit News, in one of their Autoinsider columns on Monday. I think their staff is very professional. They appear to get their information from a number of industry sources besides JDP.

Edmunds was quoted in a another Detnews article today, pointing out that luxury car sales are surging, despite incentives on 'mass market' cars. Markets getting bigger and European makers are losing share for lots of reasons besides their poorer than expected quality and well-known reliability issues. Price is definitely another. They cost too much for what they deliver vs. the competition.

Profvh, 95% of Toyota's vehicles sold in the U.S. are made in North America, including the Lexus RX330 SUV. So the yen isn't a very big issue. They already had significant price advantage in the luxury segment over the competition's less efficient manufacturing operations in Europe whether they build here or Japan.

Plus, most global corporations use very sophisticated currency hedging to amerliorate fluctuations in the dollar-yen-euro ratios. There's nothing new in what the Japanese Central bank, the Fed and EUBank are doing to justify the European car company woes.

If you look at the long term trend data the U.S. has been shifting from cars to trucks and SUVs for a long, long time. Sales of cars on an annual basis is now about 500,000 units lower than the fall of 1998, while the sale of light trucks and SUVs is about 1.3 million units higher.

The growth segments in the U.S. are sporty cars, light trucks/SUVs and luxury cars. The sporty car segment is tiny compared to the other two and has little market impact anymore.

So if you were a global car/truck company, where might you be spending your money to grow and prosper? 500 hp tire toasting, two passenger, ego boxes with flakey electronics and free service because it constantly needs it? Nope, not in this country."
4416,"April 14, 2004 5:54AM",merc1,"Who published the article is irrelevant to me, it is JDP's harping about sales falling because of what they've found in their reliability surveys is what I find to be utter bs. A 6.9 percent sales drop isn't what I'd call ""hitting the skids"" but I'd sure trump it up as that if I want to tie that sales decline to my upcoming reliability survey results that are due either at the end of this month or early next month. I'd also ignore any other possibilities as to why certain carmakers sales might be down. There could be different reasons for each brand's decline, that would been seen if anyone at JDP had a clue about other things besides reliability. There are other factors in sales declines at various carmakers.

All of a sudden mass markets expanding is the end of the over-priced European car, yet these brands (VW, BMW, MB, Audi, Jaguar) have been seen as overpriced by people who don't like them for years, yet the American public has decided this unanimously in the first three months of this year. That is the most ridiculous thing I've heard in a while. A 500hp car with a price tag to match is going to make a difference on what sales chart? Right.

The bottom line is that this article is more of the same hype that has been accepted as gospel on this board, and I'm not saying that reliability isn't hurting the European car brands. I'm saying that reliability isn't the sole factor, especially with VW which has made and sold lots of unreliable, over priced cars for years. JDP who supplied this information isn't looking at the whole picture because the whole picture is irrelevant to their organization.

4417,"April 14, 2004 6:26AM",ljflx,"There was a big story in the NY Times (and WSJ as well I'm sure) about the hedging positions against the Euro's strength all these guys had. VW was only hedged to the tune of 70% (everyone else was in 90-100% range with MB and BMW quite safe from the strength of the Euro) and as a result was getting hammered. But it was a double whammy for them - sinking sales volume and sinking profit per car because they couldn't raise prices given the competitive positions of the automobile market. VW is all over the quality issue and is smart enough to realize that it is the main reason for its slumping sales. I read a story yesterday about how they have a whole team assigned to fixing every quality issue that arises in a certain time period. They are horrified by the reports of their quality problems and understand the dangers to the company a lot better than those on this board. The trouble is that team has been on it for a while (though its size was recently increased dramatically) and they can't seem to fix the problem - and that is scary.

In the late 70's the Yen was around 300-1; today it is 115-120 (and got as low as 95 at one point). Think of the fact that Japanese car sales kept increasing (in some cases dramatically) through all that yen strengthening.

Kid yourself all you want on the quality issue but it is very serious and as designman says it's worsening.

I read another story yesterday - perhaps it was the same one (Newsweek or Time maybe) - of how Acura and Infiniti were well positioned to hurt BMW and that the TL was already doing a lot of damage. Even Automobile said the redesigned 3 series - given it's BMW's s volume seller - could put the company in trouble if it is not accepted well.

merc1 - still don't know where I said anyone was waiting for an LS. I said I was afraid of waiting for the color combos I wanted so maybe you are citing that. But let's just let it rest."
4418,"April 14, 2004 6:32AM",syswei,"You are basically making excuses for the European brands and imho the excuses don't really hold water.

1. dollar/yen/euro. The fact is that despite JCB intervention, the yen has appreciated more in the last 12 months vs the dollar than has the euro. It is about 14% for the yen vs $ YTY, and 12.5% for the euro/$. And until very recently (the 2004 RX330), Lexus had zero North American production, whereas MB (and I believe BMW but correct me if I'm wrong) have had some US production for years.

2. While the SUV trend in the U.S. has indeed hurt the European brands, why don't you see it as those brands' fault that they don't have more competitive SUV lineups? Using SUVs as an excuse would be like me saying, ""Well, if Lexus had better styling, their sales lead vs BMW and MB would be even wider."" Fact is, the styling is not better, and Lexus has no one to blame but itself."
4419,"April 14, 2004 6:33AM",syswei,"I agree with Merc1 on the general point that 3 months is only 3 months, and that reliability is only one factor that can impact sales trends."
4420,"April 14, 2004 7:05AM",merc1,"At least somebody does see that there could be more to a 6.9 percent drop in sales for a whole 3 months!

Let me be clear about this..I most certainly do see reliability and quality perceptions via the surveys to be a problem. The problem here is that most on this board don't keep up with VW to even know anything else about them except for what that article says. VW has been at the bottom of the reliability surveys for years, yet after all those years at being on the bottom they've decided to do something about it in 2004. This is implying that VW has the sense to do something about their problems (after god knows how many years at the bottom of the surveys), but a company like Mercedes isn't doing anything and don't even think they have a problem. VW's older lineup of cars and lack of incentives (until now) couldn't possibly be part of the problem could it (along with the other two issues reliability and the Euro).

Wow, Acura comes out with a hot car and all of a sudden it is doing untold (try unsubstantiated) ""damage"" to BMW. What hype. It is called competition not the end of a company. Now Time and Newsweek are automotive sources. I would think it is common sense to know that if a car company's volume seller doesn't do well it could mean trouble, but for some reason this takes on a much greater importance when speaking about BMW.

4421,"April 14, 2004 7:55AM",ljflx,"Why do you exaggerate things. I say something that is stated in a business article of a highly respected magazine and you push it to the point of the company going into bankruptcy. All I said is that they are positioned to hurt BMW and the TL is doing damage already. That spells bankruptcy or going out of business to you? I stated the Automobile point about the 3 series and simply said ""in trouble"". You have said yourself in the past (when the 7 redesign came out) that they would be in big time trouble if the 3 series and 5 series re-designs look the same and don't cut it. What's the big deal of me pointing out Automobile saying it? There are companies in trouble all over the world. It doesn't mean they are going out of business.

4422,"April 14, 2004 10:02AM",jrock65,"The way I see it, BMW and MB are going to have to check their prices at some point.

Entry-level luxury performance sedans:

Only a couple years ago, the 3 was basically in a class by itself. The C has also sold very well. Now, the G35 and the TL are taking away some sales, and Lexus supposedly has serious intentions with the next IS.

Luxury performance sedans:

So far, the 5 and the E have dominated their segment. But the new RL, GS, and M will undoubtedly make a dent. The 5 and the E will still lead the segment in sales, but no doubt a dent will be made.

Ultra luxury sedans:

The only Japanese challenger here is the LS. But just that one challenger can make things difficult for the 7 and the S, as evidenced by the segment-leading sales performance of the LS.

Luxury SUV's:

The Japanese already lead here.

Luxury coupes and convertibles:

MB and BMW hold a firm lead here, with the exception of the success of the G35 coupe.

Currently, the premium for a similarly equipped MB or BMW over a Japanese vehicle is about 15% to 20%. IMO, that will have to change, whether by rising Japanese prices or stagnating MB/BMW prices."
4423,"April 14, 2004 12:38PM",designman,"""The way I see it, BMW and MB are going to have to check their prices at some point.""

I think they already have if only in the form of discounting. I paid $8k under MSRP for my 03 530. $14.5k under MSRP for my leftover 02 Boxster S. Not even a year ago THIS WAS UNHEARD OF with both BMW and Porsche. You were lucky to get $500 off either brand as a token gesture from the dealers.

Porsche swears they will cut production and not do this again. We'll see. New model year BMWs were discounted right off the bat back in October and the discounts are getting better as the year wears on. I think we could see big price cuts over the summer with BMW... in the ilk of last year's $3.5-$4.5k hidden dealer incentive on top of the standard discounting."
4424,"April 14, 2004 3:11PM",profvh,"Based on some of the recent chatter on this website we can conclude that publicity on reliability studies are the prime drivers on car
sales, both up and down. If that is so, the Germans/European (which must be making junk vehicles) are losing market share the past several
months. Maybe they are getting their ""just desserts"" for not helping the US look for weapons of mass destruction.

If bad publicity is true, we can expect the push-
rod engined Buick Century to be rocketing upward in sales. CU, as I recall, said the Buick ranks
higher in reliability than the Toyota Camry. After all, their 3.8 litre engine is basically the same engine introduced around 1962 as I recall. Made of such long tested parts, the
uncomplicated Buick should be a best seller.

While working in my office today I heard on the TV news that Honda-Acura is recalling 600,000
SUVs and Minivans as their transmissions may fail. Based on this bad publicity we can expect
Honda sales to drop and these customers to move
to Buick and Toyota.

As a long-term Asian car owner, I have owned 5
Honda Accords. Their reliability ranked from good to mediocre. My last Accord was towed in
with a blown head gasket. It was replaced in 2002 with a new VW Passat. I have been driving
it for 28 months with only one repair, a burned out headlight. It has 26,500 miles on it. It
is as tight as new and is as enjoyable to drive
as ever.

The German haters out there will no doubt warn me that the Passat will fall apart within a short
time. Apparently CU does not agree as it is well
rated as a ""tie"" with the newer generation Accord.
Until my car disintegrates I am really interested
in only one survey: mine. I like the Passat alot."

I congradulate you on your good luck."
4426,"April 14, 2004 4:32PM",ljflx,"For the record:

CR - on the Century - says it feels like a vintage 1970's car, the engine lacks refinement, bumpy roads easily upset its composure but at least it has a spacious trunk, a roomy interior and has above average reliability. It does NOT recommend the car and shows survey results as poor (all black circle) in satisfaction and high depreciation. great endorsement - huh!

CR - on the Camry - says its a top rated family car with the Accord and Passat. The 4 liter engine is outstanding. The V6 is smooth quiet and responsive. I could go on but I'll limit it to the fact that the car is recommended, reliability is as high as you can go (full red circle - just about every Toyota is like that) and satisfaction is above average (half red circle).

sales figures - I don't think anyone is saying sales will fall off dramatically. But I do think people are saying the trend is that reliability is more important now than a year ago and will be more important a year from now than it is today. Thus if you continue to lag in reliability than your sales will continue to lag. As for 3 months of sales pointing to anything - the answer to that is simple - a quarter does not a year make. You need a lot more data than three months to see if something is building. The more important figure would be if it trailed budgets. Sometimes one budgets sales down for a variety of reasons including production related factory changes which could very well be the case with Mercedes. But if the budget were for an increase and an unexpected decrease started to occur than there are a bunch of executives who will take action and probably are not sleeping well right now. For all we know sales will bounce up in Q2 and this will simply be one of those classic ""timing"" issues.

The truth of the matter is that troubles often start small.... Little by little it creeps up on you, and before you know it, wham bam.... you are standing in the middle of an empty building, and wondering what happened. Granted it is not doomsday for the Euro cars, BUT, it will be foolhardy to ignore the obvious trends. Barely 5 years ago, MB was the undisputed sales leader in lux car sales in the US. Today, it is Japan's Lexus brand. Why ? MB is not just out of first place, it is dangerously close to becoming 4th behind Cadillac. What trend is this ?

BMW releases much anticipated new redos of its flagship 7-series. Tank job ! They make unprecendent move to redo a redo within 2 years of release. Not much change in its fortunes. Spell trouble to BMW ? Not to Merc1's thinking. And then came the new 5-series. Tank job x2. Buyers were scrambling for the 2003 5-series rather than the new 2004 design. For the savvy buyers (like designman), buying the '03 before the '04 came out turned out to be a great move. Today, you see BMW's sales declining and someone is suggesting it's no big deal. How many upper-class auto companies come out with redos only to lose sales ??? Typical trend is the opposite. Recall how much the 4th-gen 2001 LS sales was compared to the 2000 year ? It flat out was a huge sale success.... Even the slight tinker in the 2004 has been an unquestionable sale success. Germany will need to learn a lot from Japan, especially the recent successes of Infiniti and Acura, with Lexus threatening to run away with the lux car division if unchalleneged.

As we march into the future, Japan's Lexus will once again prove to Germany that if you can't accuratel predict future car trends, there is no other direction to go but down. Watch Lexus' lead in hybrid technology, and incorporation into all of their top end cars within the next 3 years. MB and to a lesser extent BMW still doesn't get it. They are planning for diesel !

People want BMW's and Mercedes' and will keep wanting them if they can afford them. Prices may be high, but coming off of a record year, I'd think MB knows what they're doing, and I'd count on the same for BMW.

Infiniti isn't even a spec in Europe or anywhere else outside of the U.S. and Japan. Acura will never be a threat to BMW on the worldwide scene with just 3 cars all in the lower and one in the middle segment (that has been a flop since 1996, the RL).

oac,

So much incorrect information, I don't know where to start. After the usual: ""I don't own a luxury car so therefore I'm not allowed to comment on anything"", you go way left on the facts. Why oh why do we get so caught up on sales numbers and when they dip for MB and BMW there is a crisis, but for everyone else when they have a sales dip it is nothing major? Your posts sound just like that rather (way off-base) article which ignores any and all other factors behind sales trends. Will you ever get it that with a lineup that costs what MB's does they aren't even supposed to sell as many cars as they do? Nope because that would be too much like right (thinking beyond the hype). Tell me who has more cars that base for 50K or more than MB and sells as many above that price point? Yet because Lexus has an fwd car, a crossover thingy and a SUV that sell well they're all that, let us ignore the sales duds in their lineup.

""BMW releases much anticipated new redos of its flagship 7-series. Tank job ! They make unprecedented move to redo a redo within 2 years of release. Not much change in its fortunes. Spell trouble to BMW ? Not to Merc1's thinking. And then came the new 5-series. Tank job x2. Buyers were scrambling for the 2003 5-series rather than the new 2004 design.""

Sales numbers please. Otherwise this is hot air. The 5-Series is a tank job? Says who? Facts please. If the 5 and 7-Series are tank jobs then the GS and IS are also. Guess what Lexus is way down this year also, the SC430. Is that a tank job too? Of course not. I'll await the article that shows where BMW is in trouble. Link please. Please tell me what re-do of the 7-Series happened after just 2 years after the car was released in 2002. Funny thing, I drove the 745i back in 2002 and then again a 2004 760Li model last fall, wow I must have missed the changes. Because their haven't been any, yet. The only change was with idrive. No engine or body (the 2nd most criticized aspect of the car) changes have happened yet. The actual face-lift that you incorrectly speak of will likely happen with the 2005 model.

"" How many upper-class auto companies come out with redos only to lose sales ???"".

Yeah how many? If you're talking about the 5 and 7-Series BMWs please provide the facts (you know like sales numbers that show where the new cars sold less than the previous generation from the start). Otherwise this is more hot air.

This board lives for unsubstantiated hype when it comes to German cars, yet we pretend everything is all smiles and sales galore for every Japanese luxury car on the road, yet some of them can't be given away. You know the ones from that threatening brand Infiniti, with 2 big fat high-priced duds at the top of their lineup. Lexus sells every GS430 (69 of them last month) and IS300 they can ship over. Right. It seems like to me the RL, M45, Q45 and GS are the ""tank jobs"" since we're judging this based on sales numbers. The cars I just mentioned never sold worth a darn from day one of their introduction, except for the GS but even that one died a quick death in the market place, yet nobody said that they were tank jobs. The Double Standard meets the hype.

4430,"April 14, 2004 10:59PM",merc1,"After really looking at the sales numbers for BMW and Mercedes-Benz for the first three months you really have to ask what in the world is all the hype based on.

Mercedes-Benz is down 5 percent for the first three months. For 2004 they don't have an all-new car to continue the fast pace of 2003, you know the year the S-Class was face lifted, the new CLK Cabriolet went on sale. Most important of all a new E-Class was introduced, which is very big deal at Mercedes-Benz. For 2004 there are no new models in which to stimulate that kind of sales growth again, yet sales dropping 5 percent is totally because of what JDP says about reliability. Right. All of a sudden in just three months the public has decided that reliability is a bigger problem than it already was. Ok. The C-Class is going through a model changeover; you know how production slows down in anticipation for the 2005 model that goes on sale in May. The E-Class has done the impossible and actually posted an ever so slight YTD gain from last year's hot introduction. The CLK, SL and even the ice cream truck G-Class are up YTD so far compared to last year.

Of course the older models in the lineup are going to slow down, this happens with every car maker, Lexus included. Please see the SC430, GS430, GS300 and IS300 YTD totals compared to last year if you don't believe this. All are down YTD from last year.

BMW is down an even more dangerous 2.3 percent YTD compared with last year. The 5-Series (the tank job) is up YTD over the 2003 car that everyone was ""scrambling"" to get. So much for that theory, at least for this point in the year. The other tank job 7-Series is off by 707 cars YTD from last year. Yep this model is finished. Wanna bet when the actual facelift does happen sales won't increase? Right.

There is an article at the carconncetion.com on VW titled ""VW Plays The Incentive Game"" that explains their situation a little more throughly compared to that JDP let us tout our upcoming surveys article.

Merc1 I understand your point and agree that everyone turns up the hype volume on their agenda... corporate nature, human nature. Obviously, reliability is not the only factor that influences buying. I point to the fact that BMW's less-than-favorable sales come at a time when they are enjoying a stellar reliability ranking. I have to believe if the new models were knockouts, buyers would be stepping on each other to get to them. Personally, reliability has always been high among my priorities. I have always been torn between this and pure passion. My conservative side usually wins.

BTW, with regard to the outgoing RL. I know it is a sales nightmare, but it's one helluva bargain. It's a good reliable family/client limo. And I absolutely love the Acura interior touches. People don't know what they are missing. There's a lot of crowd following in car buying. ""It's not selling well, must be something wrong with it."" If you want a luxury sedan and want to save a buck, this is the one. By today's standards the price is low to begin with. Add to this the discounting due to lack of demand... it's a catch in my book. I know what the next question is and am prepared to answer it. I just don't feel like blabbering on about this if it isn't necessary.

4433,"April 15, 2004 7:51AM",ljflx,"Let's see what the second quarter brings and drop all this sales stuff. A quarter is too short a time frame. But there's a lot of bad press about German cars right now. I still am hearing and reading a lot about the CR reports and now the major press media are also jumping in. None of that will help sales and none of that will help confidence and if anyone thinks that doesn't have anything to do with it then they fail to understand what affects purchase decisions. Many people are like designman and choose the conservative approach. Reliability is something you expect when you lay out the big bucks. Passion is the overstated hype here and like most things in life it rarely lives up to expectations anyway.

merc1 - it will be interesting to see where you go when you buy. If you don't buy German than all your rants and raves about them will be nearly meaningless. Many of the Lexus buyers have been buying the cars over and over - in some cases for 10-15 years. You haven't stepped up yet. It will be interesting to see if you are willing to spend $35k - $50k on an MB, BMW or Audi (certainly they will offer some car model in your price range) when an Acura or Infiniti can be had for less, deliver equal or near equal performance (maybe better in some cases) and also delivers more car and much better reliability. That is what upcoming buyers will face and all the article I read said is that Acura and Infiniti were poised to take some of those sales because of the way they have repositioned themselves. They weren't positioned to do that before as they were too focused on Lexus and probably to a certain extent the Japanes market. The article even quoted some BMW former buyers who raved about the cars and said they were done with BMW.

As for Wards - many everyday people don't even know it exists. Find me a person who doesn't know about Time or Newseek."

4436,"April 15, 2004 9:43AM",oac,"On BMW:

Designmand stated:

""I point to the fact that BMW's less-than-favorable sales come at a time when they are enjoying a stellar reliability ranking. I have to believe if the new models were knockouts, buyers would be stepping on each other to get to them.""

Couldn't agree with you more. This point states two things: reliability is NOT the be-all, and redos that fall way off-mark. Of course, there are those who choose to bury their heads in the proverbial sand and refuse to acknowledge the obvious. More power to them. I am sure BMW execs are doing something to address this indication of a wrong direction. Two new designs and sales are down ? Not good at all.

On MB:

Merc1 touts MB's higher prices as an excuse why MB sales should not be an issue. I point out that MB sales in the US are down at a time when there are far more affluent buyers than ever before. In California today, 1-in-500 earns $1M or higher per year. That is a huge market for so-called marque brands like MBs. So why is MB sales in decline despite the apparent higher purchasing power of more affluent buyers ? Go figure that out Merc1. And besides, since when does a business entity like MB not care about their sales ? Oh, I get it, MB simply needs to acquire more interest in failures like Chrysler and now Mitsu. The latter is a miserable failure and DCX may have given up on pure organic growths and looking rather into acquisitions to grow. Guess, we'll see how this new direction pans out ! An article in USA Today's (04/14/2004) talked about how MB s now *marketing* their Maybachs. Use them as hotel limos. Great way to sell a $350K car. Assume people who rides in these limos will go out and buy one. Makes so much sense to me

On Lexus:

GS, SC and IS sales are not where Lexus would like. The GS has had no redo in years, the SC still sells pretty well, and the IS was not appropriately positioned in the market. Lexus is addressing both the GS and IS. Now, we'll have to see what happens if the coming redos of these two models will effect sales and improve Lexus' bottomline. I predict that BOTH will be successful, at least much better than the market perception for the new BMW redos of the 7 and 5 brands.

Closing point: Lexus built a brand in 15 years to surpass an MB brand of 110+ yrs within the US in sales. Barron's Bank, a 116-yr-old bank went under in a very short time due to a rogue employee. If anyone believes any company is immune from liquidation, they don't have a clue about the 21st Century global economic realities. Competition today is fierce in every area, and no longer do companies have much time to correct ills; the competition would eat them for lunch. The sooner BMW, MB, VW, Audi, etc addresses their reliability issues, the quicker they can turn things around. Look at how GM is making a huge turnaround with their Cadillac brand. They may not be all the way back yet, but they have made a remarkable turnaround that should be acknowledged."

Too much money and I'm thinking GM DNA is present. No thanks. Audi's A4 is another possible choice, but only the 3.0L model, the 1.8t model is a slug. I'm thinking Audi, MB or Infiniti, the latter two I'm waiting to see their facelifts (G35, C-Class).

If passion is overstated hype (NOT!) then these reliability and now sales sermons are just the same.

As far as ""everyday"" people not knowing about Wards, what does that prove? I wouldn't expect them too because this is the same lot that will read a CR and JDP report and take it as gospel and never think past it, and for a many of these everyday people that works. They're happy with their boring appliance-like cars. Just because more people know about Newsweek and Times doesn't mean these two are automobile savvy or some type of automotive authority.

oac,

I see you've decided to ignore the obvious facts because they don't support any of the current rhetoric. When shown the sales figures to dispute the notion of the 7 and 5 Series being ""tank jobs"" you skip the subject. This is what is called unsubstantiated hype.

""Two new designs and sales are down?""

Sales are down compared to what?? Is it that you don't want to see the sales chart or don't understand it? The 5-Series is UP YTD over the previous car. You couldn't be more wrong about the 5-Series. The 7-Series is in its 3rd model year and it is only off by 707 cars YTD compared to last year. What car doesn't have a sales drop in its third model year? The SC430 has done the same, yet.... You're (hyping) stating that the 7-Series sales drop is a crisis, yet the SC430 has done the same in its 4th model year, but that isn't a crisis? No it isn't, even I wouldn't call it that. What is happening is natural and it happens with every car sold except for cars like Ferrari etc.

If you really want to see a sales drop watch the GS as it gets eaten alive by the E-Class, 5-Series, RL, M35/45, A6 and STS, which all are either on sale or go on sale before the new GS does in....gasp...a year from now. Timing is everything; someone might want to let Lexus know this.

So what? California is but one state and can't carry the entire sales mantle for Mercedes-Benz or any other brand. It is also foolish to think that just because there are more people with money that they're going to want to show off this wealth by purchasing more Mercedes-Benzes. A totally new product is the only thing that will keep sales for MB or any other company at their same level as a year ago, especially when the previous year was a record year. Why am I even replying to something so ridiculous?

Secondly, their biggest seller the C-Class is going through a model changeover. I don't know why this is so hard to grasp. Yet MB remains in either 3rd or 4th place in the sales race despite having the highest priced cars of any mainstream luxury brand. Yeah what a failure they are because they aren't able to sell as many tarted up Camrys or tall wagon thingies that sell in the 30-40K range, yet most of MB's products are priced at 50K or above. Yet Mercedes-Benz is supposed to win the sales race. I don't think I've read anything so far off in left field on this board in quite a while.

Since you're sales theorems are nothing but hot air you'll turn to the MB's corporate situation. Guess what, I don't like it either, but it really has nothing to do with their sales performance so far this year.

Excuses, excuses. The GS has been a failure since the first model back in 1993 it has never sold up to expectations. Yet the failure of a 7-Series you keep incorrectly talking about debuted in 2002 and beat the previous 7-Series' best year! FACT. The IS was half-baked and everyone knows it. The SC430 blew right past Lexus' sales estimates for its first year quite easily yet in it's 4th model year has slowed down. This is the same thing as the 7-Series. The same exact scenario, yet BMW is in trouble and Lexus isn't. This isn't a crisis to most people here, but a natural thing that happens over time, but if you're making a case against BMW you'll play this up as a crisis, though other cars are in the same exact situation.

 I notice you use the words ""market perception"", when talking about the 5 and 7-Series, yet the cars are selling, so this perception you have isn't based on anything factual. The press has harped about BMW's new styling and idrive, yet just like you guys tell me when a Lexus takes a beating in the press or comparo....the press doesn't buy the cars and they don't have to live with them.....so what they say doesn't count. Yet here for the sake of building a shaky case (at best) about BMW, market perception makes the 5 and 7-Series failure yet they've outsold the previous designs. WOW. A contradiction at each and every turn in the Lexusworld. Double standard hype at its best.

4451,"April 18, 2004 11:50PM",merc1,"You and others are harping about Lexus' sales performance, yet you conveniently ignore that the whole Lexus franchise is basically being pulled by 3 vehicles...the ES, RX and to a lesser extant the LS. The IS and GS are show room decorations, the SC430 is being outsold by the 30K+ more SL, and the GX does ok for it's segment, but reading this board you'd think that all of Lexus' models are star players and outsell competing vehicles when they don't. Now prestige and image have now come up. Before it meant nothing and was all in a Benz or BMW owner/fans mind, yet this very same thing is supposed to overcome the fact that the average BMW or Mercedes is thousands more, in order to help them sell more cars. Makes sense because prestige can account for the price difference, no matter if you can make the jump ($$$$) or not. Very Logical.

You mentioned California, funny you should do so. Guess where the largest market for high-end Benzes is in the world outside of Germany? Newport Beach, CA. Now tell me since you're the expert in sales trends, at what point does the market become saturated and sales drop? Mercedes already has the California market at the upper end. Don't believe me? Check out the tuner Brabus' website, they've set up shop in two places to cater to high-end Benz owners, one in Florida and the other in California because of S, SL, and CL sales trends in those two states.

A new SLK has been shown and goes on sale in Sept. This couldn't possibly have anything to do with sales dropping off. Funny the 2000 LS400 dropped like a rock right before the 2001 LS430 arrived, but there was no crisis there. Hmmmmm. The C-Class is going through a model change that happens early next month. That couldn't possibly have any affect on sales. The CL and S after being facelifted for 2003 and posting better numbers than in 2002 shouldn't possibly slow down this year. Makes sense. The ML being the exact same age as the Lexus GS shouldn't see a sales drop either. Makes sense. The Lexus GS selling a whopping 69 GS430s in March shouldn't worry anyone at Lexus, I mean really the GS is only facing about a 1/2 dozen newer entries (like the ML is with the Touareg/GX470/Cayenne/X5 etc) so sales of the GS should remain the same, but MB is in trouble with the ML. Makes sense.

Mercedes and BMW are finished, while Lexus goes for ""exclusivity"" with the GS430 which is rarer than the VW Phaeton, Audi A8L, Infiniti Q45 and M45, and Acura RL all of which are considered sales duds, but the GS430 isn't. The age of the GS430 couldn't be the reason for this. No way. These other cars are just ""better"".

4453,"April 19, 2004 4:22AM",designman,"BMW dealers used to pound their chests with the fact that they didn't have to discount. Those days are over. But we don't see the heavy discounting parsed in the already less-than-impressive sales figures. Although BMW is considered one of the most successful auto makers, they are losing lustre in a changing world. It's much too early for this to sink in, but I believe it is starting to.

The 5-series came out of the gate with discounts. One buyer already reports $3k off retail on a 525. The 7 has undergone heavy price lopping. If the summer brings discounting equivalent to or close to last year's and sales are buttressed in this manner, will sales be considered a success? In my book this is not a feather in the cap of the noble German."

I find it very funny that certain Lexus' have never sold worth a darn and yet they aren't considered failures.

I personally don't like the 7-Series either, but this hot air blowing based on sales figures is utterly ridiculous. I can understand if a person doesn't like a certain car, but they could at least get the facts straight or get some that supports their theories/views because the sales argument doesn't.

I don't quite understand the statement. maybe a rephrase is in order.

I think what merc1 meant was the LS400 sales in 2000 were low throughout the year. And that it was basically due to the imminent release of a redesigned LS(LS430). Basically it's sales dropped on 2000 because alot of prospective LS shoppers wanted the LS430 instead and sales also decreased because the product was getting old(less people wanted a LS as opposed to other newer designs such as MB S-class).

  I'll just add my two cents to the discussion..I'd agree with Merc that MB and BMW are not in serious trouble. I'll qualify that with a ""Yet"" however. You can't ignore the bad press both automakers are having right now. Reliability is still a major part of the decision making process. IF left unaddressed, this is going to start to hurt their bottom line. Anyone have profit/loss data on Toyota, DCX, and BMW?

You could say what Reliability to is MB, Styling to Lexus. It's a problem no doubt. Merc is correct in his assessment of the Lexus product line. The GS, SC, IS, and LX are older designs. The latest generation of Lexus designs are encouraging however. I like the streamlined look of both the new LS and RX. The GS concept still does nothing for me..It's highly subjective isn't it?

I'd like to see Lexus develop an AMG style line, no more of this half hearted L-Tuned nonsense. The Company has been around since 1990, so they've had long enough to get their act together. Also, they ought to turn the SC back into a real sports car, not some retiree cruiser. Ditto for the IS and GS lines.

A sidebar..Which of these cars have the best exhaust system? As a big fan of V-8 engines, I always enjoy a satisfying roar with the turn of the key..The LS430 disappoints in this respect, the old 92 LS I have makes more of a roar when started..

""The GS, SC, IS, and LX are older designs.""

The SC is not too old, just looks old! It's as old as the current LS. The LX is a older design that is still selling extremely well.

Every carmaker has it's successful product lines, the small percentage of product lines that make up a huge proportion of overall sales. Lexus has the ES, RX, and GX making up about 60% of it's sales. BMW has the 3-series making up 45-50% of it's total sales volume. Mercedes has the C-class and E-class making up about 50% of total Mercedes sales.

The GS sold about 2000 units during the first quarter, and that pace is decreasing, which is understandable w/ the new one coming in March '05. I figure they sell about 7000 GS's this year.

Currently, the E sells about 4000 per month, and the 5 sells about 3500 per month.

By fall of 2005, I predict (sales per month):

E: 3,400

#1 in reliability (5+ years in a row according to JDP)

4465,"April 20, 2004 1:25AM",merc1,"See how maxhonda99 and sv7887 got the point about models and sales trends, but no.... You and oac keep harping about sales of MB and BMW declining yet when I dare point out that Lexus has the same problem with one of their duds you all post the same thing over and over like in post #4752 because that's all you know, even though it doesn't pertain to the conversation.

Sales decline is everything when it comes to MB and BMW and yet the sole reason has to be reliability, but when Lexus (with their industry leading reliability), can't move certain models their have to be other reasons; old product, specialty cars that don't sell much etc. etc., but these same reasons couldn't possibly apply to MBs and BMW's in their 3rd model year (7-Series). Unbelievable, but typical. Golly Gee production of the 2000 LS400 was slowed down intentionally, but the 2004 C-Class can't possibly be in a decline of the same sort due to a face lifted 2005 model coming. Makes sense to me.

""And for BMW, two new designs and not much uplift in sales compared to expectations.""

Oh, but before the car sold less than before, but now they had a small uplift. What a difference a sales chart makes when you actually look at it. Tell me what BMW's sales expectations for the 5 and 7-Series? You do have this information this right to make that statement right?

What are the sales expectations for the GS this year? As many as they can sell, seeing as though the car is a dead duck. Like a company really will release or boast about a sales goal for the last year of production. That is so ridiculous, but BMW passed their stated sales goals for the 7-Series back in 2002 the car is now a failure now because it hasn't sold at the same level 3 model years down the road. That is so silly.

If you're asking this question about the GS' sales goals this year to imply that they are selling up to expectations or even decently you're only fooling yourself. Nobody wants to sell 69 units of any model in this class. Since the SC430 is dropping and is a specialty car it doesn't matter. Let MB show a sales drop with the SL and see how this board reacts. Crisis for days.

""Sales SC and 7 series...To use your own arguments since the SC doesn't sell much anyway...does it really matter if their sales drop a little...Not much lost there. If a High profile car like the 7 series loses sales..Well...That is an important development..Don't you think?""

Total confusion. Where did I ever say a sales drop wasn't anything significant because a particular car is a ""specialty car"" or because the particular car doesn't sell much anyway? That is your excuse not mine. Every mainstream luxury car maker has an ideal sales figure for every car they produce. The SC430 only costs 60K, not a whole lot of money for that class of car, seeing as though all of its European competitors cost more, yet it is a ""specialty"" car and shouldn't sell much. BMW, Mercedes, Jaguar don't see their ""specialty"" 2-seaters/2-door models the same way. Don't you realize that with such a small market niche that the SC430 competes in visibility is very important and every sale counts just like it does with a high-end sedan. Do you think Lexus won't address the SC430's situation with a facelift and possibly a SC300 V6 model only to not worry about loosing a few sales. I know you don't believe that. Of course they want to sell more!!!

The 7-Series has lost 707 sales YTD and it is a development, but the GS has lost way more and that is no news. See a double standard here? You could argue that the GS is much older and on its way out and people are waiting for the new model etc, but you can't see this as the case for say the SLK, which is also dropping like a rock this year in anticipation of the new model. Is the SLK excused for being a specialty car?

Before the host says it I'm done with this round. When other Lexi fans see the point I know I'm not exactly crazy, but keep preaching about how reliable the slow selling GS and IS are.

I would have like to have seen the posts if this board were around in 1993 when Mercedes only sold about 60K cars for the whole year in the U.S., yet the E-Class now moves about that many units per year all by itself. Edmunds' Town Hall server would have been choked with posts about MB's demise.

4466,"April 20, 2004 2:09AM",merc1,"""For MB, US sales position have changed from #1 to almost #4.""

They managed to get to number 1 for one year, what in 1999 or 1998??? They did this on the back of the ML SUV which back then was a big deal for Mercedes-Benz because they never sold one here before. One year at #1 because of SUV and they are supposed to maintain that momemtum and compete with a company that makes fifty percent of their sales on SUVs and the other 50 percent with much cheaper cars, mainly a 35K fwd model. Right.

Dont' get me wrong here. I congratulate Lexus for their market success in the SUV area, the Germans are still clearly behind here. Notice how I don't even dare suggest that this is Lexus' fault.

But how come if MB has increased sales each year since 1993 (from 60K to over 200K) in this country, with higher prices than everyone else, a 4.7 percent drop in 2004 is seen as the beginning of the end? If anything with such a high priced lineup MB's market share grew in proportion to what could be reasonably expected of a brand with much higher priced cars, in other words they're going to always get a smaller share of the sales pie. I wonder how many over 50K cars (still the bulk of their models) Mercedes has to sell compared to Lexus tearing up the under 50K segment with the ES and RX for sales to be a wash. What am I thinking money is no object and sales are sales everyone can afford to buy-upwards.

I wonder why Ferrari doesn't outsell Porsche or why Maybach doesn't outsell Bentley? Price certainly couldn't have anything to do with this.

4467,"April 20, 2004 4:10AM",footie,"Merc1

If MB built better cars and built cars better, they could sell them for less money and be more profitable. It's the way smart companies in competitive marketplaces win.

MB prices are higher than Lexus (and Infiniti and others) because their cars cost more to produce, sell and service. Their production processes aren't as efficient as Toyota's nor their ability to manage their supply chain as good.

They have a broad product line with low volumes in many of the lines. The engineering costs are higher, the production volumes lower, the learning curves slow to deliver improvements. This results in the higher defect levels that impact production and the resulting poorer dependability, reliability, serviceability and availability impact their costs and customers.

* Higher defects during production raise direct costs
* Higher defects during warranty raise costs
* Higher defects requires more marketing money to prop up the decade old superiority image, now no longer true

Mercedes doesn't sell their cars at today's prices because they want to, they do it because they have to. Their entire marketing campaign is designed to make you think you are getting something you aren't. ""Like no other"" is right, better said as ""No two are the same"".

Their profitability is lower ( and the Chrysler-Jeep drain no help ). Their R&D is tighter and narrower and this makes them more dependent on suppliers for new technology, which is widely available to others. The technical edge is gone and often bleeding edge, not leading edge.

I don't think that MB is 'dying' but they are in serious trouble for the first time here in the U.S.

They haven't adapted to the competition yet and it shows."
4468,"April 20, 2004 7:15AM",ljflx,"I'll just give you my view of what OAC and others, including myself are saying.

I think any hint of a decline of the German marquees is exaggerated into the companies are going out of business. I haven't read where anyone has said that or even hinted at it. But in the financial community you are always looking for the tip of the iceberg as an indicator of things to come. I think all that people see here are a lot of tips of the icebergs. The business model built in the past may not be so sustainable going forward - at least not at the success level of the past. Look at all the clues out there. The bulletproof cars built are gone as is the mystique that both brands build bullet proof cars. The improvement in quality is slowest among all car brands. The resale values are falling faster (in percentage terms) than any lux brand out there. That means the upfront prices as new cars can't hold much longer and there are plenty of indications of that. Heck - I just saw a $77k S430 lease deal advertised at only $100 a month more than my $65k LS430 and it wasn't specific to any individual car. I saw $77k BMW deals advertised at the same rate as my $65k LS430. Lux brand dealers don't have come-ons - at least not in my experience. Now throw in a fierce competitor like Toyota who is well capitalized, very profitable (record earnings just made) with a rare and very strong Balance Sheet for a manufacturer. They build cars very efficiently and may have a big market lead in the next gen car engines (for the US market at least). Add in a rapidly recovering Nissan (in the hands of a European which is ironic)and a Honda that has always been strong and you see alot of competitive warning signs out there. On top of that throw in a Chrysler that has to be rebuilt and will utilize a lot of resources and may uiltimately drag down the famous lux brand name. I just read stories on the Hemi (a car I like by the way except the rear from the side has an old Eldorado look to me) and couldn't miss the cross jabs and some comparisons to the E-class let alone the instances of part sharing. Remember Lexus was built on top of Toyota whereas Chrysler is being rebuilt under MB. Big difference in perception to the market. Finally you have the strength of the Euro to contend with, the first signs of falling sales (we'll see if it's real or a false alarm in the coming months) and the media coverage of CR's car quality - whether you accept that or not - it's there.

Anyway my point of all this is that there is not one tip of the iceberg out there but many. This has nothing to do with enthusiastic cars bult today and everything to do with the business of selling them and continuing their domination. Will the business stay healthy enough and capitalized strongly enough to maintain that edge or not. We're not talking about the next 2-3 years here but the 5-10 years after that period. Personally I don't think so and I think BMW is stretching themselves too far these days. But that's just my business opinion. Sometimes tip of the icebergs are overstated and sometimes they are not. As I said before it will be interesting to see this play out. But the long and short of all this is that even when you hit the iceberg you don't have to sink. Look at IBM.

By the weay - I never made it to the auto show. Buiness issues on Friday (the day I really wanted to go), a more complex tax return than I expected and family functions took away all opportunitities.

I agree with all of this, but that wasn't what we were talking about here. My point for the last couple of days has been that a few on this board are hyping small sales losses as the end of BMW and Mercedes-Benz or like they are in some type of galactic trouble. Yet in the same post they'll come up with all kinds of excuses as to why certain other brands (Lexus) have similar problems with certain models, but those logical reasons couldn't possibly apply to Mercedes-Benz or BMW models of the same age and/or going through a model change over. One thing of interest here, how is MB managing their ""supply"" chain incorrectly? They do it the same way any other luxury car maker does. In what way is Mercedes different? Please explain this.

Everyone knows that Toyota is the production efficiency king. Everyone knows that it costs more to produce cars in Germany for the reasons you mentioned, and some others you don't. Even when Mercedes topped these reliability surveys in the early nineties they still cost way more than the competition, so all of the cost is not sheer reliability and defects.

""Their entire marketing campaign is designed to make you think you are getting something
you aren't.""

Really? So all of the innovations that Mercedes has and their beyond government safety standards, and in many cases much more variety doesn't account for anything. Right. Lexus' marketing slant is that of a knock-off Mercedes with their LS and a knock-off BMW with their IS and probably the upcoming GS. Just because you don't see anything more in a Mercedes doesn't mean it isn't there.

""I don't think that MB is 'dying' but they are in serious trouble for the first time here in the U.S.""

Really? I would call serious trouble back in the early nineties when Lexus started gaining ground and Mercedes sold less than 60K cars a year for a few years. That is serious trouble. Now if you're basing this assessment on the reliability situation then your statement has more merit. If your statement is based on the sales drop of the first three months, then it is nonsense like the other posts of similar ilk.

I agree they do have a reliability problem and the perception of the problem is getting worse. What I disagree with is the buzzards-are-circling mentality on this board in particular.

""Their profitability is lower ( and the Chrysler-Jeep drain no help ). Their R&D is tighter and narrower and this makes them more dependent on suppliers for new technology, which is widely available to others. The technical edge is gone and often bleeding edge, not leading edge.""

I agree the Chrysler arm is a drain, but they may be starting to turn that around too. Maybe. They have a ton of new product on the way. However, tell me if MB's technology is so supplier based (like a lot of Toyota's isn't) then why is that Mercedes manages to always beat Toyota to the punch (specifically Lexus) to the market with it? I took the LS430 until 2004 to acquire certain features the S-Class back in 2001. This fact doesn't jive with your statement.

ljflx,

Well not to get too deep into your post, but your posts for the most part have always had a logical/factual base, others don't. I always pay very close attention to your business minded posts and really can't take issue with anything you've just said. My problem was (in part) with people talking about sales losses for certain models (5-Series) when in fact it wasn't even true.

You and footie shouldn't think for a minute that I don't see a problem with Mercedes and to a lesser extant BMW. The reliability issue will only get worse before it gets better. Why? Because most of these surveys look back 3 years and for 2004 they'll be looking at 2001 models and for 2005<>2002 and 2006<>2003 so it is going to take some time for MB, BMW, Audi, Jaguar, Land Rover, and whoever else is deemed unreliable, to pull themselves up.

There were two or three options I remember the V8 S-class cars having that the LS lacked (as options) in 2001. One was the ABC system and that is still the case. I would bet though that 90+% of all S-class cars are sold without it anyway. It's a fairly expensive option and there were one or two S-class board posters at that time who had opted for it and were having crazy things happening to them because of it. I remember one guy finding his car in a different position (level wise) in his garage the morning after he pulled in and the car was naturally un-drivable. This happened to him a number of times and MB couldn't seem to fix it or even find the problem. My MB sales rep told me not to consider ABC at the time I looked and after reading that guys posts later on I knew why. Another option was Keyless-go which Lexus of course now has and which both of us like very much. When I shopped in 2001 I was intrigued by the Keyless go system but none of the inbound S-class cars had it nor did any of the showroom cars. When I asked why I was told by the MB sales rep that they were having problems with it and had put a hold on it until the cause was found and cured. The third thing might have been the timeport (if that was the name) phone. Naturally the other thing they offered was a 12cyl engine if you went the S-600 route. Lastly - MB may have had more airbags than Lexus. I do know someone who totalled an E-class (the guy fell asleep at the wheel) and walked away unharmed. It was really the steering wheel air bag that saved him (so he would have been fine in most cars) but nevertheless I'll never question MB's commottmment and leadership in this area. I haven't kept track of Volvo but they were well known in the past as the mfr. at the head of the class in safety.

On the other hand Lexus had the single based DVD nav system, the ML stereo and the 6 in-dash CD system. MB had answers to all three but they were way short of the Lexus benchmarks."

Misses the mark badly as far as I am concerned. Maybe MB will incorporate some Maybach goodies. That car has the best interior I've ever seen. But in sub $150k cars Lexus, Jaguar and Audi are the kingpins for me right now. I do love the antique walniut wood on the black leather custom/ultra LS."

""You know, you are master (and maybe commander) of misinformation and double talk.

This from the same poster that didn't know anything about the sales numbers harped on so much in their theory. Ok. What was that about the BMW 5-Series selling less than it did before the re-design?

"" Isn't that what we were all saying here ? So all those excuses you have been given all amount to, what, squat ?

I and others have always said that MB and BMW have problems, you on the other hand went on and on about sales figures that once proven by the actual numbers, as opposed to hype, proved that you didn't have a clue about the 5-Series in particular and your claims were based on the 5 and 7-Series being ""tank-jobs"". Now when asked what this claim was based on you kept talking about sales, which didn't prove a thing other than an actual increase for the 5-Series and a 707 unit decline YTD for the 7-Series, hardly the end as you so loved to harp about. Face it you were dead wrong about the sales numbers and then (like your most recent post) you turn to corporate matters, since your doomsday theory wasn't supported by the sales numbers. Now you're talking about who is the better manager. More reaching for another angle it seems.

I never said at any time on any board that Mercedes, BMW or Audi don't have problems, I objected to basing these claims sales numbers for 3 months and then on top of that not even bothering to check the numbers to see if they supported that theory, which they didn't. The others (footie included) here actually presented factual evidence of a problem. I'm done with it.

So you posit that I am wrong about my previous postings on the direction of MB and BMW ? You want facts, eh ? OK. Well, take a look at the following links and see for yourself. I leave you and others to judge the facts, rather than rants....

Market Trends report:
http://www.freep.com/money/autonews/sales6_20040106.htm

Just so it is clear where the TRENDS are, here are a couple of quotes from the above link:

Honda had the biggest year-over-year gain, 8.2 percent. Fellow Japanese automakers Nissan and Toyota followed closely on Honda's tails, with formidable gains of 7.4 percent and 6.3 percent, respectively. All picked up market share

Within that segment, the Cadillac brand is making sales gains on Mercedes-Benz. The GM luxury brand finished the year with 216,090 cars and trucks sold, compared with Mercedes' 218,717. That is a difference of more than 2,600 vehicles, a gap that has narrowed from more than 13,000 vehicles in 2002

I could pull a lot more links for you, but I think I made my point. BMW's 5-series sales growth was 8.8% over 3 months. Yipeee ! Happy ? I surmised they dipped, you showed they grew by <1,000 units over 3 months. We'll have to see by year's end who is right."
4482,"April 21, 2004 10:59PM",merc1,"I could find even more links about sales figures for days and days. So what? Until you realize that sales fluctuate for different reasons (which you dismiss) then your point is moot with me. Until you factor in price-, product age-, hot new models+, model change over-, along with reliability- and everything else that can have either a negative or positive effect on sales, you're only repeating the same thing over and over.

A few month sales declines does not spell the end of BMW or Mercedes. Period. Trends happen all the time, and they are just that, trends. They can change in either direction just as fast as they started.

I guess by the end of the year if Cadillac passes Mercedes in sales, that will mean they make a better car. Let us forget that they don't even compete price or product wise with any Mercedes above the E-Class. Oh, except for the whopping 300-unit-a month XLR.

When another brand can sell the number of cars Mercedes-Benz and BMW does covering their entire price ranges then I'll take note. Until then those brands who light up the under 50K segments and don't move nearly as much 60-120K iron as BMW and especially Mercedes don't mean squat to me.

I love how you tout Lexus' sales when basically only 2 of their vehicles have truly outstanding sales.

4483,"April 21, 2004 11:28PM",oac,"Oh, I do factor in all of those variables you mentioned - price, age, reliability, model change over, etc... Aren't all of these auto companies (Jag, Audi, BMW, Lex, MB, Caddy, etc) in similar situations ? Yet the direction remains the same for MB and BMW, according to current reports. Isn't the bottomline to IMPROVE SALES ??? And sales is not important ? OKee dokee.... In 1 yr, GM's Cadillac has shaved off >10,000-unit sales difference with MB. And you are not worried ? Glad you are not an MB exec....

The E- is a new design and doing so-so, the S is being redesigned after only what 4 years in its current skin? The new C is going to be out soon, but the old strangely continues to sell briskly. Why ? Maybe cos it is cheap, relatively speaking. I still maintain that redos for BMW has NOT meant much. Maybe MB's new releases and redos will help their bottomline ? Maybe not. I guess we'll see, won't we ?"
4484,"April 22, 2004 12:58AM",merc1,"We're only 3 full months into the New Year, and no all companies are not in the same situation. Some have newer models, so have older models. Some are going through model change over in the spring as opposed to the fall. Some have new products in the hottest segments of the market. Staggered model introductions etc. etc. There a jillion reasons why sales could be off for any particular brand as a whole at any given point in the year. This is why I look to look at the individual models to see who is doing what. Give the spring buying season a few months to lead into summer and then count the totals.

VW is the only brand that anyone has mentioned here that has had a continuous drop from year to year, not MB, BMW or Audi. If I were VW I'd be worried, and they've clearly said as much. Their sales have been in a free-fall for over a year, not the others! Every one of VW's affordable cars date back to either 1998 or 1999. No other brand is even remotely in the same situation, which is their fault. The Phaeton and Touareg are new, but cost a lot of money for VWs. Complete uphill battle there for VW, especially with the Phaeton, which will never be a big seller.

Another factor is suvs. Lexus and Cadillac, to their credit cash in big time here. Almost fifty percent of Lexus' business is SUVs. Cadillac just added a crossover to their product mix, the SRX. Nothing but pay dirt to be had there. Also like Lexus they have a hot 30-40K car, the CTS. The current Seville isn't even on the same page with the E-Class in sales. They dropped the STS version of the current Seville in preparation for the new STS this fall. See how that could affect sales for the whole brand if they didn't have the SRX/Escalade to prop the brand up???

I'm not trying to say that SUV sales aren't significant, just illustrating a point as to why certain brands are grabbing the sales headlines right now. Just think what the sales numbers for Lexus would be without the RX330 and GX470 and Cadillac without the Escalade and SRX.

My point is the Europeans are traditionally weak in the SUV market (which is their fault) and they tend to have model lineups that are thicker at the top end of the price spectrum. Mercedes-Benz in particular when you look at their model/price spread, frankly has no place in a sales race to begin with. I was shocked when the broke 200K units a year. The C-Class (their biggest seller) was way down last month and will probably sink even further once this month's totals are counted. The 2005 model doesn't go on sale until mid-May.

The S-Class came to market in spring of 1999 as a 2000 model and was face lifted for the 2003 model year. The next S-Class is due to come here in the spring of 2006 as a 2007 model. This is also the oldest car in its class yet is only second to the LS430 in sales. That doesn't say anything? Before spring of 2006, which is a long time from now, of course the car will fade away sales wise, this is only natural. The LS430 is on a similar time table and will cool down after this year also.

No I'm not worried in the least about Cadillac gaining on Mercedes in sales. Still doesn't prove who makes a better car nor is the sales race equal for all brands. When Cadillac can sell more then 300 XLRs a month I'll take them seriously. 10K cars is not a lot of ground to make for a brand with a much cheaper lineup of cars overall.

BMW has three new models for 2004. Only the new 5-Series was available from the start of year. I was never sure why you mentioned the 7-Series as being the problem when the car is in it's third model year and is hardly news anymore, a decline here is inevitable. You do realize their new X3 and 6-Series models only went on sale in mid-March? How could you possibly base that theory about BMW's redos not making a difference when 2 of their three new models for 2004 weren't even on sale in Jan-Feb???? Another reason why I say all this hysteria over the first three months is unfounded. Wanna bet the 645Ci Convertible has not hit its stride yet? I'll eat my shoes if BMW doesn't increase their overall sales this year compared to last year!

I think if you truly did factor in everything you wouldn't have made nearly as much fuss about any of this, especially based on a mere 3 months worth of sales numbers.

4486,"April 22, 2004 7:26AM",ljflx,"You can't do what you say regarding sales and popular models. Every business has an 80-20 or 70-30 rule or some majority dominating products in which much of the revenue comes from a handful of products. You would have to remove the two highest sellers from each brand if you did what you propose. In the case of MB and BMW you'd have to drill down to the platform level. Plus I'll maintain that most people don't view the RX as an SUV anyway. The GX and LX - absolutely - but the RX is much more like a car and comes from a car platform.

4487,"April 22, 2004 8:30AM",maxhonda99,"Here's some stats about sales proportions as relates to the overall product line-ups sales:

Mercedes thru 1Q04:
C-Class and E-class sales totalled 28,209 out of a total of 49,159 in sales. That means about 57% of Benz sales come from just 2 classes of vehicles out of 9.

BMW thru 1Q04:
The 3-series range(Not including Z3/Z4) totalled 27,430 units vs. total BMW of 52,970. that equates to the 3-series carrying 52% of the sales load. That's right one model range out of 8.

Lexus thru 1Q04:
The ES and RX range totalled 41,449 vs. total Lexus of 65,392. That equates to 2 product lines making up 63% of total Lexus sales. Or 2 model ranges out of eight.

And I know another claim leveled against Lexus a bad thing is that Lexus sales are mostly SUV(which BTW is not Lexus fault if other companies can't design proper SUV that will sell).

Thru Q104, Lexus SUV sales have come out to 51% of total Lexus sales."
4488,"April 22, 2004 9:08AM",designman,"To me the above stats mean luxury and status have more significance to the lower-end buyer than they do to the manufacturers. The lower-end buyer wants a piece of the upper end. The manufacturer wants the supermarket bucks. Can't blame them, but this is helping to drag down the quality, reliability and mystique of the high-end luxury marque. As the world creeps toward economic parity, I see a world rife with mediocre products."
4489,"April 22, 2004 9:40AM",ljflx,"I think a couple of things are going on.

1. As the lux brands (maimly MB and BMW here) go down market they get more buyers and hence have to mass produce. This wasn't their planned business model so they don't do it so well. They were designed to be a boutique shop and venturing away from the initial business plan is always a problem - in any business.

2. The involvement of sophisticated electronics in cars also is a move away from their engineering prowess and is not a core strength and in fact is a pronounced weakness.

3. Both of the above play strongly into the Japanese hands because they are very well versed in mass production since that was their original business model and they are masters of electronics. The Lux car building move was made on top of that business model. It is easier to go from A to B than from B to A.

4. Many of the German car fans point to the things that have made the brands famous as still being great. I agree with them and don't think for a second that German engineering or the core of their automotive strengths have declined. They probably have gotten better. It's just all the electronics built around them that don't fare well. Unfortunately car building isn't as simple today as in the past and the competition is fiercer than ever - particularly at the lux end.

I don't think you will see an NFL in the car industry. I think you will see a continued strive for high quality everywhere. I just don't think everyone will get there. The Japanese are there already though with their leading brands.

VW - different set of problems. Something has gone wrong there."

Your premise is correct, however mass production gave way to Lean Production long ago. What was developed as the Toyota Production System (TPS) is now a management philosophy across all companies in the Toyota corporate empire. Toyota insiders refer to TPS as the ""Thinking Production System"". Problem solving at the value-added worker level is their core asset.

These concepts are at work throughout the Japanese Automotive world in one form or another."
4494,"April 22, 2004 5:20PM",ljflx,"I said it before - let's see how Q2 develops before jumping to any conclusions. My take thus far is that VW does have some serious problems on their hands and BMW may have problems developing. I think MB is fine for a simple reason. They do have a number of new models coming out and it's typical to slow production in an older model for two reasons. Changes in the assembly line and slowing demand in anticipation of a new model. That's typical and the reduced sales is more tied to the business process rather than market demand. MB should be pretty hot a year from now. If they aren't then that will be indicative of a real systematic problem.

4496,"April 22, 2004 8:39PM",pablo_l,"It amazes me that sales success continues to be as an argument here, as if sales numbers indicate excellence. In that case, the VW Golf is the best euro car, and something like the Honda Civic probably exemplifies Japanese perfection. Which to a certain degree they probably do, it's far tougher to produce excellence at a premium.

But luxury ought to be naturally about *small* volumes. If it becomes the norm with high sales, it's just the standard, and those with aspirations merely set their sights higher...

By the way, these days I find Jaguar interiors over-rated. I think the perception of them still being interior leaders shows that the perceptions around these cars are quite emotional, and colored by brand history and reputation. People *want* the Jag leather and wood to be supreme. In my experience with my last XJR, it was very nice, but it had some cheap touches. Vinyl armrest and such. People criticize Mercedes interiors, but Mercedes has always gone for a more spartan interior design. It's part of the brand. They're fixing the tactile aspect of the materials, which have by the way always been extremely durable. In world dominated by leasing, how these cars will look like after 10 years of daily use doesn't seem to matter much anymore, which is a bit of a shame.

Best luxury interior in my mind these days goes to the Range Rover. A friend has one, and it is awesome. I am a snob when it comes to car interiors (and interior design in a house!)... :-)"
4497,"April 22, 2004 9:49PM",merc1,"I think so too. I was just making the same point you've already stated, that this first quarter panic is hype and unfounded when you look at the actual facts. Even yearly we're talking about tenths of percent here! The only brand in real trouble is VW and their problem is mainly having an old model lineup and not offering American and Japanese car level incentives, until now. The next year will be very tough for them since the new Passat, Jetta and Golf don't get here until at least this time next year.

DCX as a whole needs to wake up, true. I would call all the new product at least a sign of them waking up, and I'm talking about the Chrysler side.
